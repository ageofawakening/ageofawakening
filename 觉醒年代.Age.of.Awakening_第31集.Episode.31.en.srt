there is still hope.

10
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,440
That's all.

11
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,480
This is stepping back.

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
It's surrender.

13
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,880
The reason why China is so timid and weak now.

14
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,280
There is not enough people like Guo Xingang.

15
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,200
But too many people like Hu Shi.

20

Hello, uncle.

48
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,920
We are looking for two children.

Yes, they did this afternoon.

What happened yesterday inspired me.

121
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,760
I had ideas,

122
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,080
wanted to write an article on this,

123
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
"Shandong Problem and National Consciousness".

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
It was raining hard.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,200

126
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,480
and finish writing here.

if you don't use force to bring them down,

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
then whatever you do,

136
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,520
no matter how loud you shout about justice everyday, it's pointless.

137

We do not advocate force over justice.

138

We don't advocate using force to crush people.

140

Let me put down the small table.

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
I wrote an article, just read to him.

172
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,040
Who is the adult here now,

173
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
you or him?

174
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,920
Your son just woke up from a concussion.

175
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,760
You chose to read him an article right away.

176
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,400
You want him out on the streets again now?

177
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
Auntie,

178
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
are they still organizing street speeches?

179
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
I really don't know.

180
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,640
But I knew that Qiaonian was caught in the rain last night.

181
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
He had cold too.

182
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
I let him lie at home.

184
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,680
You don't know this.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,960
Last night,

186
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,040
your father carried you himself,

187
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,480
all the way to the hospital.

188
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,400
I wanted to stay and watch you.

189
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Your dad didn't agree, he kicked me out.

190
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,160
He stayed here alone,

191
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,440
for the whole night.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120

193
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
Why you are taking about that now.

194
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Now you are here, I'm leaving.

195
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Doctor said that he needs an injection in the morning.

196
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
I'll go to the Red Building to print this.

197
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
You trying to tire yourself out?

198
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,080
Look at yourself.

199
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Can't you go home, have some food and rest first?

200
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,600
Change clothes before you go.

201
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
No time for that.

202
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,440
The Earth won't turn without you, will it?

203
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
You don't say, if I'm leaving at this time,

204
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,080
it's really possible that it won't turn.

205
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,160
You--

206
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,240
Yannian,

207
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,680
let's eat first.

208
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,480
Okay.

209
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
Instruction of the Ministry of Education

210
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,200
by order of Premier Qian Nengxun's

211
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:44,547
[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

212
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,640
signed reply.

213
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,080
In view of the present situation of schools in Beijing,

214
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,920
the Ministry of Education has decided

215
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,720
schools in Beijing will suspend classes from now

216
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,800
and have early summer vacation instead.

217
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,880
The graduating class of each school

218
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,280
will attend the graduation exam as usual.

219
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,280
Students who do not take the graduation exam will not be granted with their diploma.

220
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
The Ministry of Education of the Republic of China.

221
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:09,088
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

222
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,760
They really know how to play.

223
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,760
It was the hard way yesterday and the gentle way today.

224
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,520
With this leading to people either leaving or preparing for exams.

225
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
It's a strike right on our weak point.

226
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,960
Mr. Shouchang, how's that?

227
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,960
Think about it. A school holiday

228
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,520
means all the normal activities of the school

229
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,640
stopped.

230
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,640
Library and Canteen shut down.

231
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,920
Teachers go home.

232
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,800
To students then,

233
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
it will only be more difficult.

234
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
Besides, since it's a holiday.

235
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
The general strike will lose

236
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
all influences on the government.

237
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,840
I see.

238
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
In addition, the graduating class students have to take the exam.

239
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
These students alone

240
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
makes up one-third of all the students who were in the strike.

241
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,360
If they don't take the exam

242
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
they won't get their diploma.

243
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,640
Without a diploma,

244
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,160
it's hard to find a job.

245
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
For their own future,

246
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
they have to take the exam.

247
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,040
But once you decides to take the exam

248
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
it also means that you are going back to class.

249
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,920
Then the general strike will collapse.

250
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,040
That's a harsh move.

251
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
What do you think we should do next?

252
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
The country is in peril.

253
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
However, those superior people only focus on

254
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,640
how to create obstacles for patriots.

255
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
They underestimated our determination and strong will.

256
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
Inform student officers and professors.

257
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
We are having a meeting in the library.

258
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
Talk about the next step.

259
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,640
Okay, I'm on my way.

260
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,400
Students.

261
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,160
Since the Ministry of Education announced the instruction of

262
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
class suspension and ongoing exams.

263
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,640
It had a great influence on all schools.

264
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,400
Beijing Agricultural College,

265
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,080
Law school, and other schools,

266
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
many graduates in these schools

267
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,040
had to cancel the strike.

268
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,200
In addition, the State Council issued

269
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,800
that civil service and diplomatic judicial examination this year

270
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,880
will be brought forward.

271
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,400
This had a negative impact

272
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
among some students.

273
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,960
Today,

274
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,640
the number of students on strike dropped sharply.

275
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,680
Also,

276
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
because of the severe repressive measures taken by the government

277
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,840
some students felt intimated.

278
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600
Combined with military and police blockade.

279
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Today, all ten-people groups from each school cancelled

280
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
all the demonstrations and speeches on the streets.

281
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,200
What should we do next?

282
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,000
We must find effective ways and means.

283
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,160
Otherwise, this fight will be unsustainable.

284
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,680
Brother Zhongfu,

285
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,200
isn't Yannian injured?

286
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,160
What are you doing here?

287
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
What did the doctor say?

288
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,040
He's fine.

289
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,880
Doctors checked, and it's fine.

290
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Haiwei,

291
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
this is the article

292
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,800
I wrote in the hospital last night.

293
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Have someone carve and print leaflets.

294
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,880
Send it out today.

295
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,280
Yes.

296
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
Haiwei, wait.

297
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,320
Brother Zhongfu.

298
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
Now the streets are full of military police and cavalry.

299
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
Public speeches and distribution of leaflets are banned.

300
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
I say we should hold your article for now.

301
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Don't print it.

302
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,080
The situation is really tense now.

303
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,920
We can't push on like this.

304
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
If we carry on,

305
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
the heavy loss will outweigh the gain.

306
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
Shizhi, I was up all night.

307
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
I wrote this article

308
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,280
for people like you,

309
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,800
people who dare not fight against the reactionary government,

310
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
for you to read it.

311
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,040
Hai Wei.

312
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,120
Read it to everyone.

313
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes.

314
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
There are two things people must acknowledge at this point

315
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,360
regarding the Shandong issue.

316
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,960
One, we can't rely solely on a consciousness based on justice.

317
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
Two, we can't let a few people

318
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,120
control this country as a monopoly regime.

319
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
Based on these two points,

320
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
we should have two purposes in mind.

321
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,680
That we should strongly support justice.

322
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
That the civilians over the government.

323
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,280
Good point!

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
This kind of situation requires

325
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
a loud and firm voice like that.

326
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,520
Why do you have to go to extremes?

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
Why do you have to do this?

328
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,400
It's meaningless sacrifice.

329
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:11,920
The--

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,440
Have you heard from the Students Union?

331
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
Zhongxia and the others are in a meeting now.

332
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
We are working on countermeasures.

333
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,320
What do you think?

334
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
My attitude and thoughts are all in this article.

335
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,880
Fight to the end.

336
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
Of course, we should consider Shizhi's opinion.

337
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
Don't make unnecessary sacrifices.

338
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
I agree with Mr. Zhongfu's proposal.

339
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,760
Power should aside with justice.

340
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
People's common will is above the government.

341
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,040
We must never give in

342
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,240
to the ferocity of the reactionaries.

343
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
So tomorrow, the pro-Shandong groups from all schools

344
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
will be on the street

345
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
and escort the ten-people lecture groups.

346
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,640
Worst case scenario.

347
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Let's play hardball with the police.

348
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Yes, we are not yielding.

349
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
This is brute-force, Liu Haiwei.

350
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
Don't be foolhardy.

351
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
You misinterpreted Mr. Zhongfu's meaning.

352
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,680
Just now, Mr. Zhongfu has made it very clear.

353
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
We can't make unnecessary sacrifices any more.

354
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
We should pay attention to methods and strategies.

355
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,480
I think at this time,

356
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
we should take a step back, cancel the strike.

357
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,600
Then turn to a legit approach.

358
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,760
Shizhi, if we do as you say,

359
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,800
taking a step back,

360
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,440
we might as well give up and surrender.

361
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,960
My brother Shouchang,

362
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,680
how can you be

363
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
reckless like some of the students.

364
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,040
You are a tutor for the youth.

365
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,040
What you should do now is to calm them down.

366
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
Instead of adding fuel to the fire.

367
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Shizhi, you're wrong.

368
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
Now exactly is the time to add fuel to the fire.

369
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,960
That's what we should do.

370
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
Students' patriotic enthusiasm

371
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
is on fire now.

372
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
We need to make it burning even stronger,

373
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,520
so strong that it illuminates the whole society,

374
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
and set that patriotic enthusiasm on fire all over China.

375
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
So we can save our country.

376
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,680
Good point!

377
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
You are students of Peking University.

378
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Can you not tell what's right and wrong?

379
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Brother Shouchang,

380
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
you will pay for your applause one day.

381
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,320
Pouring oil onto the fire.

382
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,160
Are you trying to burn yourself

383
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,560
and the whole Peking University to death now?

384
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,440
Shizhi!

385
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
I know you have opinions and emotions, you can come at me.

386
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,520
Are you trying to dragging everyone backwards now?

387
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,880
We didn't take extreme measures.

388
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
The Beiyang government did!

389
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
The police wounded the kids.

390
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
They took the students, didn't you see?

391
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
You are a teacher.

392
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,360
Can you really leave that alone?

393
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
Mr. Shouchang.

394
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,760
Anything from the Students Union?

395
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,040
Classmates,

396
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,920
we have just received a telegram from Paris.

397
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,760
The telegram says,

398
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
the envoy of Paris is sparing no efforts to take their stand.

399
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,440
Overseas Chinese in Paris are also marching to fight.

400
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,840
Please don't give up.

401
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,760
Be sure to stick to it.

402
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
So the Beijing Students' Federation's

403
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
provisional congress unanimously decided

404
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,160
that thirty-six affiliated schools will continue to strike

405
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
and fight to the very end,

406
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
never give up until we reach our goal.

407
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
Good!

408
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,640
At the same time, the Federation also decided,

409
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,960
in order to reduce unnecessary sacrifice,

410
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,040
ten-people lecture groups in Beijing

411
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,240
will cancel demonstrations and demonstrations.

412
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,480
It can be replaced by other ways.

413
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
By selling domestic products

414
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,720
and mobilize citizens to boycott Japanese goods.

415
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
Boycott the Paris Peace Treaty,

416
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,520
so please all the students in all classes of Peking University.

417
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
Hurry up and prepare domestic products.

418
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,840
Tomorrow we take the action to the streets.

419
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Classmates,

420
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
this message Deng Zhongxia

421
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,200
brought from the Federation of Students

422
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,560
is what I just said.

423
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,000
Take one step back.

424
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,000
Everyone please think it over

425
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
and bear in mind.

426
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,160
We respect the opinions of the Students Federation.

427
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,200
But,

428
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
this article "Shandong Problem and National Consciousness"

429
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
will still be published in the "Weekly Review".

430
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
Let's split up.

431
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
Get into action.

432
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,800
Shizhi,

433
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,360
I was pushing too hard just now.

434
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,400
In front of your students,

435
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,680
I didn't consider your stand.

436
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,520
I understand you have anger in your heart.

437
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
Brother Zhongfu, I know you are not targeting me but the situation.

438
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm fine.

439
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,800
You are faking.

440
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,040
There is no lie between us.

441
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,800
No matter what do you think,

442
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,040
I have to say this.

443
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,000
With the present situation at this critical moment,

444
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
do you really think our country

445
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
can afford to take a step back?

446
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,640
Even just one step,

447
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,040
do we still deserve to be a citizen of this country by then?

448
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,560
If you still disagree,

449
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,920
I'll buy you a drink another day.

450
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
Domestic products, support domestic products.

451
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
Auntie, some canned food?

452
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Would you like canned food?

453
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Selling domestic products.

454
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,880
Have a look.

455
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,000
Please take one.

456
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
One. I'll have one.

457
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,800
Thank you.

458
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

459
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
Please support domestic products. Thank you.

460
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,880
Auntie, some canned food?

461
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,680
Cookies?

462
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,800
Selling domestic products.

463
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Tooth powder, toothbrush, canned food.

464
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,840
Selling domestic products.

465
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
Support domestic products.

466
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
Tooth powder, toothbrush, canned food.

467
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,560
Fengzai.

468
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
Chen Duxiu is the general behind the whole student movement.

469
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
Before,

470
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,560
he used Cai Yuanpei control students.

471
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:38,115
[Wu Bingxiang, Chief of Metropolitan Police]

472
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
Now, he is using publications to lead students.

473
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
Do you have any thoughts about him?

474
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,560
I--

475
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,760
Come sit down.

476
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,920
Take your time and have some tea.

477
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,880
Yes.

478
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I think the easiest way

479
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,920
is convict him of incitement

480
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
arrest him and sentence him.

481
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,560
That won't do.

482
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
Chen Duxiu has a great social influence.

483
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,280
If we have no evidence to support conviction,

484
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,640
it will only intensify contradictions,

485
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
cause more unrest.

486
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,120
Not good. Not good. Not good.

487
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
Then we isolate him.

488
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
Let him be embattled.

489
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Leave him no mind to think

490
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,120
about the students.

491
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Looks like you have some ideas to share.

492
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Talk about it.

493
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Chen Duxiu is a grumpy man.

494
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,080
He offends people on a regular basis.

495
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
He has many enemies in Peking University.

496
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,160
Especially Gu Hongming, Huang Kan, and Liu Shipei.

497
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
They are a few influential and respected professors.

498
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,680
They all disagree with Chen Duxiu.

499
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,440
They don't think highly of how he pushed

500
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
the students movement.

501
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
Besides, Chen Duxiu is now

502
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,600
no longer a dean of liberal arts at Peking University.

503
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,960
It's a good time to instigate these people,

504
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
have them go after him.

505
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
This opportunity can also be used to

506
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,520
disintegrate the student movement.

507
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,040
Aren't you from Peking University?

508
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,160
You can do this.

509
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Chief, I was expelled from Peking University.

510
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,160
It's not that I don't want to do it

511
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,600
My words doesn't matter.

512
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm afraid that it's you with power

513
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,480
can make a difference.

514
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,120
What can you do then?

515
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,840
I can find his son.

516
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,560
Chen Duxiu's son?

517
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,120
Right.

518
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,240
Explain.

519
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
Chen Duxiu has three sons and one daughter with his ex-wife.

520
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,880
The eldest son Chen Yannian and the second son Chen Qiaonian

521
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,960
are all live with him in Beijing now.

522
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,080
These two

523
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,680
don't go long well with Chen Duxiu.

524
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,040
Especially Chen Yannian.

525
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,120
He believes in anarchism, stubborn as hell.

526
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,400
He was wounded the other day

527
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,280
when he gave speech in Qianmen.

528
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
He's still in the hospital.

529
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
I can try to turn him around.

530
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
See if we can use him

531
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,280
to restrain Chen Duxiu.

532
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,480
Put aside what you're doing.

533
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,040
Concentrate on this matter.

534
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
I'll allocate special funds for you.

535
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,040
I'll give you credits when it's done.

536
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,720
Thank you, Chief.

537
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,040
Remember.

538
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
Don't expose your identity in the police department

539
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,040
while you are doing this.

540
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,320
Rest assured.

541
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
I am only the editor-in-chief of the column of the "Gazette"

542
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,800
Go ahead.

543
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
Fengzai,

544
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
isn't your uncle a congressman?

545
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,000
He has good relationships with

546
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,920
Gu Hongming, Liu Shipei, and Huang Kan.

547
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,920
Right.

548
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
We will have Education Minister Li

549
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,360
to arrange a meeting for them all.

550
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,960
What do you think?

551
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,520
Good!

552
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,960
This is a wonderful plan.

553
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,320
I'll inform my uncle.

554
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,440
Go ahead.

[Gu Hongming, born Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

556
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,760
Such a bad timing for

557
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
Minister Li inviting the three of us to dinner.

558
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,800
Strange. What does he want?

[Liu Shipei, styled Shenshu, Professor at Peking University]

I really don't know.

Education Minister Li claimed that

562
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
he has admired us three for long,

563
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,560
he wants to make friends with us.

564
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,760
So,

565
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,560
Zhang Changli hosted this banquet for us today,

566
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,320
said to introduce each other.

567
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,680
Zhang Changli?

568
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,160
Why didn't you say this earlier?

569
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,080
This is an ambush banquet, up to no good.

570
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,120
I'm leaving.

571
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,680
Master Tang.

572
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,158
Master Tang, don't go yet.

573
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:49,440
Master Tang.

574
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,200
We are here already anyway.

575
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm sure he won't make it hard for us.

576
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,880
Why don't we wait and see?

577
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,480
You are here.

578
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,240
Master Tang.

579
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
Jigang, Shenshu.

580
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,800
Let me introduce.

581
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
This is the one who will be promoted to Vice Minister of Education.

582
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,120
Director Li.

583
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,760
Master Tang.

584
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,244
Please, please, please.

585
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:20,160
Please. Please.

586
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,160
This way.

587
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,680
Come.

588
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Please. Please.

589
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,760
Please sit here, please sit down.

590
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,760
Gentlmen, please sit down.

591
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,560
Masters, how about we sit on the second floor.

592
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,400
All right then, please.

593
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,440
Dare to ask you two,

594
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,000
what is this banquet for today?

595
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,960
I don't take credits without doing due work.

596
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,400
I, Gu Hongming, never just sits down without knowing the reason for the invitation.

597
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,720
I'd ask you two to make it clear.

598
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,520
Masters,

599
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,400
please, let's go upstairs and then talk.

600
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,720
Please, please, please. Please.

601
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,160
Please.

602
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,680
You two, pardon my language.

603
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,320
I am not the brave type.

604
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
I am worried just sitting here.

605
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,480
Dare not to drink without knowing something at least.

606
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,600
Please explain to us.

607
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
I am here today.

608
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,400
I came here and I took the seat.

609
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,400
I have given you two due respect.

610
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,640
If you don't make it clear,

611
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,600
then I'm afraid I have to leave.

612
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
It's nothing major.

613
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,360
Director Li will take office soon.

614
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
He just wants to make friends with you three.

615
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,160
Please, no need to overthink.

616
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,160
Let's talk over dinner on the second floor.

617
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,120
Please.

618
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:21,683
Right.

619
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,240
Please.

620
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,695
Please.

621
00:30:25,713 --> 00:30:25,960
Please.

622
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,480
Please.

623
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,560
Uhh..

624
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,280
Look at this.

625
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,400
Uhh...

626
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,080
Look at this.

627
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
Director Li.

628
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,480
All three here are honorable people.

629
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,920
Then let's be honest.

630
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
All right, all right.

631
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,440
Masters!

632
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,440
I, in the Ministry of Education,

633
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,400
take the responsibility of managing the university.

634
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Since the May Fourth Movement

635
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,960
under the incitement of Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao,

636
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,120
Hu Shi and others,

637
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,840
the strike has went on for almost a month in Peking University.

638
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,360
Education in Beijing has been completely paralyzed.

639
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,000
What a heavy loss!

640
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,080
It's painful to only imagine about this.

641
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
For my country,

642
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
and for my own duty,

643
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,800
I would like to ask the masters here

644
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,360
to step out and bring justice back,

645
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,200
to resume class and start teaching again as soon as possible.

646
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,800
I'm begging you.

647
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
Master Tang.

648
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,720
If the three of you can go to the lecture

649
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,720
and resume teaching,

650
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,560
not only that is Peking University's great luck,

651
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,760
but also the country's luck.

652
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,920
Director Li knows that the three of you

653
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,760
have been suppressed by Chen Duxiu for years,

654
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,360
not having the chance to pursue your ambition.

655
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,160
Yes.

656
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,240
He is very willing to do his best for you.

657
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,760
Stand up for us?

658
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,800
Yes.

659
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,760
Good!

660
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,760
What's the first step?

661
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
I'd like to hear all about it.

662
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,200
It's like this.

663
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,400
If the three masters can help the government

664
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,040
restore the teaching order as soon as possible,

665
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
you will be the heroes of Peking University.

666
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
I am willing to promise you three,

667
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,440
that you will take charge of Peking University

668
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,600
together with Hu Renyuan, the new headmaster of Peking University.

669
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,880
How's that?

670
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,200
Now I see why I feel baffled this whole day.

671
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,920
Turned out I am seeing a weirdo today.

672
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,720
Although I don't agree with Cai Yuanpei

673
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi's cultural viewpoints.

674
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,360
I haven't forgotten that I am a Chinese.

675
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,800
I absolutely do not approve

676
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,040
this government trying to just accept this traitorous Paris agreement.

677
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,720
I don't agree with the students' strike.

678
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,640
But,

679
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,920
I will never sell my students out.

680
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,120
You are looking down on me.

681
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,960
Thinking a banquet can buy me off.

682
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
You shameless bastards!

683
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,000
With you evil schemes!

684
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,920
Masters, please don't go.

685
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,400
There is red line one will never across!

686
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,880
Uhh...

687
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,080
Uhh...

688
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,159
Uhh...

689
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,720
Did you hear what you just said?

690
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,200
This is all on that moroan Wu Bingxiang.

691
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,880
He screwed things up.

692
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,400
This... this... this...

693
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,440
Wrong door.

694
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,040
Dude.

695
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,320
See.

696
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,800
I heard that you were gloriously wounded.

697
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,000
I was entrusted by the Publicity Department of Beijing Students Federation

698
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
to give a little gift to show my respect.

699
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,240
A gift.

700
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,840
The Publicity Department of Beijing Students Federation.

701
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,520
Aren't you already expelled from Peking University?

702
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,960
How can you be in the publicity department?

703
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,640
Dude!

704
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,840
True, I was expelled from Peking University.

705
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,920
But I am now

706
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,280
editor-in-chief

707
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,800
of the column "Xuehai Chunqiu" in the "Gazette".

708
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,920
This column supports the student movement.

709
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
It is under the leadership of the Publicity Department of Beijing Federation of Students.

710
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,240
Especically responsible for reporting student sports.

711
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,400
Isn't "Gazette" a newspaper of the Anfu Club?

712
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,040
You support patriotism now?

713
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,560
What with the Anfu Club?

714
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,320
There are patriots in the Anfu Club.

715
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,760
Take me for example.

716
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,200
Although I don't approve

717
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,560
with this new culture.

718
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,600
I don't approve of your work-study mutual assistance.

719
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
But I firmly oppose to the Paris Peace Treaty.

720
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,760
My hometown is also Shandong.

721
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,920
I will never allow Shandong being handed over

722
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,120
to the Japanese.

723
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,320
There are also traitors in Shandong.

724
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,240
If you are really care about this country,

725
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,520
you should go and do something practical.

726
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
Talking nonsense to me here is useless.

727
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,880
I'm telling you dude.

728
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,760
You can't look at people in the old way.

729
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
This column "Xuehai Chunqiu" I run

730
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,840
is appointed by Beijing Students Federation

731
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,520
as a column to publicize the student movement.

732
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,920
Take a look.

733
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
This is my journalist certificate.

734
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,320
Look.

735
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,520
Picture.

736
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,160
Stamp.

737
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,920
For real, I am not lying.

738
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,720
I see.

739
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
So you are a different person now.

740
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,640
Congratulations then.

741
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,920
I need to go exercising.

742
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,320
Don't go.

743
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
You are a wounded hero.

744
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,800
You are also the eldest son of Chen Duxiu, leader of the student movement.

745
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,200
I was assigned to interview you.

746
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,640
I want to write a report for you.

747
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,680
Interview again?

748
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,320
Last time, you used interview to set up Liu Mei.

749
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,600
You want to set me up this time?

750
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,960
Don't mention Liu Mei to me.

751
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
I get angry when you mention Liu Mei.

752
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,440
Besides, who set whom in the last interview?

753
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,280
You know better than I do.

754
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,800
Didn't you ask for it?

755
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,560
I'll tell you clearly.

756
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't accept interviews.

757
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't waste your time here.

758
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,320
Fine, then we won't do the interview today.

759
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,000
I'll just tell you something, all right?

760
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
About your father Chen Duxiu.

761
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,600
Not interested.

762
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't go yet. Sit down.

763
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,040
Sit down. Listen to me.

764
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,720
This is very important. Sit down.

765
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,840
You see.

766
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,320
Recently, our column "XueHai Chunqiu"

767
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,280
received letters from readers and some leaflets.

768
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,080
It's all about your father.

769
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,560
Excuse me.

770
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,040
It's all negative for your father

771
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,480
Chen Duxiu.

772
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,560
We don't know what to do with it.

773
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,360
I want to hear your opinion.

774
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,040
What, you don want to look?

775
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
Ever since he came to the Peking University,

776
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,680
there are people slandering him everyday.

777
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
Newspapers even framed rumors.

778
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,080
You take these rotten old news to me.

779
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,360
What's the point?

780
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,920
You read carefullly.

781
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,160
This isn't some rotten old news.

782
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
This is the fact.

783
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,440
This pile,

784
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,360
is all the statements from witnesses.

785
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,880
Read for yourself.

786
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,320
This is Chen Duxiu's business, and you ask for my opinion.

787
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
What's your intention here?

788
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,440
Ah,

789
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,480
I was being kind.

790
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
Think about it. I have all these materials.

791
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,440
Once it's in the newspaper

792
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
it's gonna be explosive.

793
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,920
Then just don't put it out.

794
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,760
It's not up to me whether it'll go public or not.

795
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,280
Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei,

796
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,560
I don't like these two,

797
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,400
but I know what's the real issue here.

798
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,360
It is the critical moment of the student movement right now,

799
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
with Cai Yuanpei left,

800
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Chen Duxiu is recognized as the public mentor for the youth.

801
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Some people even say

802
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,200
that he was the commander behind the May Fourth Movement.

803
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,480
At this critical moment,

804
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
a big scandal of a key figure like him

805
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,160
will be destructive

806
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
to the student movement.

807
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,400
Do you know?

808
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
I, as a

809
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,840
editor-in-chief of a newspaper column under the leadership of a student union,

810
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,560
I can't watch the student movement collapse.

811
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Do you understand?

812
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,720
What should I do then?

813
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
You are his son.

814
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
It is your duty to stop your father.

815
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Don't do bad things at this time.

816
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,240
Stop shaming the student movement.

817
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,000
Newspapers attack him every day.

818
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,840
None of them were solid evidence.

819
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,680
Who is the witness?

820
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,680
Let him confront me.

821
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,960
If what he said is true,

822
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,480
I, Chen Yannian

823
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,720
will disown Chen Duxiu immediately.

824
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,400
We Peking University...

825
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,760
Many of professors at Peking University are witnesses.

826
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,360
Who are these many professors?

827
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
If it's the traditionalists who are against new culture,

828
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,960
I don't think I can fully believe their words.

829
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
Fine.

830
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
Then I'll give you two people.

831
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,760
Not traditionalists.

832
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,960
Shen Yinmo, the peer editor of "New Youth"

833
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,720
and an old friend of your father's,

834
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
Principal Tang Erhe of the Medical School.

835
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,920
These two back then,

836
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,360
they helped and recommended your father.

837
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,840
Not long ago, it was these two

838
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,520
strongly proposed to dismiss your father

839
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,120
from the dean position in liberal arts department.

840
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,440
Yannian.

841
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,680
I know how you feel right now.

842
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
Knowing that my father is this kind of man.

843
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,720
I can understand how you feel now.

844
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,040
Well.

845
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,360
I'll leave these here.

846
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,400
Take a look when you are free.

847
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,360
Yannian.

848
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,000
Facts are facts.

849
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,000
It's up to you

850
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,920
to face them or not.
