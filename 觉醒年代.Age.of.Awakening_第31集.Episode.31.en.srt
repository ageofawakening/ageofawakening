[Episode Thirty-one]

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,560
The reason why I proposed to move Peking University

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,600
south to Shanghai.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,160
It's because I want to keep Peking University intact.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,600
As long as we have it,

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,640
there is still hope.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,440
That's all.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,480
This's steping back.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
It's surrender.

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,880
The reason why China is so timid and weak now.

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,280
There is not enough people like Guo Xingang.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,200
But too many people like Hu Shi.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,720
Brother Zhongfu

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,480
Please calm down.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,480
I rashly proposed to move Peking University to Shanghai

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,400
without consulting with you.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,720
I was wrong.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,040
Now all the proposal and signature letter

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,240
are burnt down.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,160
It won't have any influence.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,400
Let's call it a day.

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,360
I'll buy you a drink another day.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,880
To offer my apology properly.

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Excuse me

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
Let's go. The police are coming. Let's go.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,280
Liu Mei

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Chen Yannian

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:41,920
go

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,160
go

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,360
go

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,320
Yannian

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,040
brother

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,480
Liu Mei

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
Yannian

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,160
Liu Mei

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,160
Yannian

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,760
brother

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,640
Yannian

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,000
Sister Liumei

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,160
Yannian

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:02,960
brother

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,520
Who are you looking for this late?

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,640
Hello, uncle.

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,920
We are looking for two children.

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,080
One male, one female, both in their twenties.

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,640
The students gave speech earlier, right?

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
Yes, they did this afternoon.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,200
Then you should stop shouting their names here.

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
Those students were either driven away,

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
or taken away.

52
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
Then where else should we go?

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,200
You guys?

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,600
I think you'd better try your luck at Dashilan.

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,800
There are many shops over there

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,280
Dashilan

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,400
right

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Okay, thanks.

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,760
Just turn that way.

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,040
Yannian

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,840
Be careful.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,200
Yannian

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,800
Hang in there.

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,800
Can you hear me?

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,160
You hear me? Hang in there

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,640
It'll be all right.

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,720
Don't give up.

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,440
Yannian

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,760
Yannian

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,280
Chen Yannian

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,800
Liu Mei

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,360
Uncle Chen, auntie!

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,880
We are here.

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,440
Liu Mei

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
We are here.

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,840
Uncle Chen auntie, we are here.

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,240
Yannian was injured by the cavalry.

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,880
Wounded

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Yannian

80
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
Unconscious

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,440
Hurry to the hospital.

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
Come on, get up

83
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,280
Come and help

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,680
Send to hospital

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,040
come

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,920
rise

87
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,480
come

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:16,640


89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,240
come on

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,760
come

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,360
Qiaonian hold the umbrella.

92
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,560
go

93
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:24,880


94
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,200


95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,440
Go that way.

96
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,320
Why are you up?

97
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,520
Sit down.

98
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,280
Down

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,040
lie down

100
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,680
Why am I here?

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,760
You were wounded by the police.

102
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,560
We were close to the French hospital.

103
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
I brought you here.

104
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,960
Nothing major.

105
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,600
Mild concussion

106
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
Liu Mei and others?

107
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
Liu Mei had back injury.

108
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,560
and cold.

109
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,520
She had a fever.

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
She's also in the hospital.

111
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,640
But the doctor said it was okay.

112
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,480
Both of you are fine.

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,080
Just rest for a few days.

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
What about me auntie

115
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Why are you here alone?

116
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,160
I

117
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,280
I brought you here yesterday.

118
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
What happened yesterday inspired me.

119
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,760
I had ideas,

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,080
wanted to write an article on this.

121
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
<Shandong Problem and National Consciousness>

122
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
It was raining hard.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,200
So I thought I might as well grab onto the insipration

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,480
and finish writing here.

125
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,920
I never went back.

126
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,080
Want to hear it?

127
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,840
Let me read you a paragraph.

128
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,680
eh

129
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,320
Now, the warlords in China and Japan

130
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,960
Aren't they all enemies of justice?

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,240
Civilians of both countries

132
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
If you don't use force to bring them down.

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
Then whatever you do,

134
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,520
no matter how loud you shout about axioms everyday, it's pointless.

135
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,320
We do not advocate force over justice.

136
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,240
But we have to advocate for using force to bring justice back.

137
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
We don't advocate using force to crush people.

138
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,000
But we have to advocate that

139
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
people under suppress to fight back with force.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
A person or a nation.

141
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
Without their own strength of self-defense,

142
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
soley depending on the idea that justice will flourish,

143
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,480
relying on the grace of others' forgiveness and help

144
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,000
to survive.

145
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,880
How powerless and shameless this is!

146
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
It's like a slave kneeling and begging.

147
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,040
Do you agree with me?

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,080
ah

149
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,080
What do you mean, ah?

150
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,480
I agree.

151
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
But some people don't.

152
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,760
Who?

153
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,760
The guy I dragged back to school,

154
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
the one regarded as a mentor for your generation,

155
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
Professor Hu Shi

156
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
You are both up.

157
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,240
Auntie

158
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
How's it going? Any better?

159
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,000
Much better

160
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
Hi, Uncle Chen.

161
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,400
Are you feeling better?

162
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,840
Yes.

163
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,600
Are you okay? Are you still dizzy?

164
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,480
Much better

165
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
What about you?

166
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm fine.

167
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,560
What were you two talking about just now?

168
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,520
Let me put down the small table.

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
I wrote an article, just read to him.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,040
Who is the adult here now.

171
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
You or him?

172
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,920
Your son just woke up from a concussion.

173
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,760
You chose to read him an article right away.

174
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,400
You want him out on the streets again now?

175
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
Auntie

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Are they still organizing street speeches?

177
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
I really don't know.

178
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,640
But I knew that Qiaonian was caught in the rain last night.

179
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
He had cold too.

180
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
I let him lie at home.

181
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,080
Yannian

182
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,680
You don't know this.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,960
Last night,

184
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,040
your father carried you himself,

185
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,480
all the way to the hospital.

186
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,400
I wanted to stay and watch you.

187
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Your dad didn't agree, he kicked me out.

188
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,160
He stayed here alone,

189
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,440
for the whole night.

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
Later, I wanted to...

191
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
Why you are taking about that now.

192
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Now you are here, I'm leaving.

193
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Doctor said that he needs an injection in the morning. 

194
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
I'll go to the red chamber to print this.

195
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
You trying to tire yourself out?

196
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,080
Look at yourself.

197
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Can't you go home, have some food and rest first?

198
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,600
Change clothes before you go.

199
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
No time for that.

200
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,440
The earth won't turn without you, will it?

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
You don't say, if I'm leaving at this time,

202
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,080
it's really possible that it won't turn.

203
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,160
you

204
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,240
Yannian

205
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,680
Let's eat first

206
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,480
Yes

207
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
Instruction of Ministry of Education

208
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,200
According to Premier Qian Nengxun's

209
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,640
signed reply order.

210
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,080
In view of the present situation of schools in Beijing,

211
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,920
Ministry of Education has decided

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,720
Schools in Beijing will suspend classes from now

213
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,800
and have early summer vacation instead.

214
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,880
The graduating class of each school

215
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,280
will attend the graduation exam as usual.

216
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,280
Students who do not take the graduation exam will not be granted with certificate.

217
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
Ministry of Education of the Republic of China

218
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,760
They really know how to play.

219
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,760
It was the hard way yesterday and the gentle way today.

220
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,520
With this leading to people either leaving or preparing for exams.

221
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
It's strike right on our weak point.

222
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,960
Mr. Shouchang, how's that?

223
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,960
Think, a school holiday

224
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,520
means all the normal activities of the school

225
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,640
stopped.

226
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,640
Library and Canteen shut down.

227
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,920
Teachers go home.

228
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,800
To students then,

229
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
it will only be more difficult.

230
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
Besides, since it's a holiday.

231
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
The general strike will lose

232
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
all influences on the government.

233
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,840
I see.

234
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
In addition, the graduating class students have to take the exam.

235
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
These students alone

236
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
makes up one-third of all the students who were in the strike.

237
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,360
If they don't take the exam

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
they won't get their diploma.

239
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,640
Without a diploma,

240
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,160
it's hard to find a job.

241
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
For their own future,

242
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
they have to take the exam.

243
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,040
But once you decides to take the exam

244
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
it also means that you are going back to class.

245
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,920
Then the general strike will collapse.

246
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,040
That's a harsh move.

247
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
What do you think we should do next?

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
The country is in peril.

249
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
However, those superior people only focus on

250
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,640
how to create obstacles for patriots.

251
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
They underestimated our determination and strong will.

252
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
Inform student officers and professors.

253
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
We are having a meeting in the library.

254
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
Talk about the next step.

255
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,640
Okay, I'm on my way.

256
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,400
Students.

257
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,160
Since the Ministry of Education announced the instruction of 

258
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
class suspension and ongoing exams.

259
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,640
It had a great influence on all schools.

260
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,400
Beijing Agricultural College

261
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,080
Law school and other schools.

262
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
Many graduates in these schools 

263
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,040
had to cancel the strike.

264
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,200
In addition, the State Council issued

265
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,800
that civil service and diplomatic judicial examination this year 

266
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,880
will be brought forward.

267
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,400
This had a negative impact

268
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
among some students.

269
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,960
Today,

270
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,640
the number of students on strike dropped sharply.

271
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,680
Also,

272
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
because of the severe repressive measures taken by the government

273
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,840
some students felt intimated.

274
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600
Combined with military and police blockade.

275
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Today, all ten-people groups from each school cancelled

276
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
all the demonstrations and speeches on the streets.

277
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,200
What should we do next?

278
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,000
We must find effective ways and means.

279
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,160
Otherwise, this fight will be unsustainable.

280
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,680
Brother Zhongfu

281
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,200
Isn't Yannian injured?

282
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,160
What are you doing here?

283
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
What did the doctor say?

284
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,040
He's fine.

285
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,880
Doctors checked, and it's fine.

286
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Haiwei

287
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
This is the article

288
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,800
I wrote in the hospital last night.

289
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Have someone carve and print leaflets.

290
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,880
Send it out today.

291
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,280
Yes.

292
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
Hai Wei, wait.

293
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,320
Brother Zhongfu.

294
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
Now the streets are full of military police and cavalry.

295
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
Public speeches and leaflets distribution is banned .

296
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
I say we should hold your article for now.

297
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Don't print it.

298
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,080
The situation is really tense now.

299
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,920
We can't push on like this.

300
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
If we carry on,

301
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
the heavy loss will outweigh the gain.

302
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
I was up all night

303
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
I wrote this article

304
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,280
for people like you,

305
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,800
people who dare not fight against the reactionary government,

306
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
for you to read it.

307
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,040
Haiwei

308
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,120
Read it to everyone.

309
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes.

310
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
There are two things people must acknowledge at this point

311
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,360
regarding the Shandong issue.

312
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,960
That we can't rely solely on axiomatic consciousness.

313
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
And we can't let a few people

314
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,120
control this country as a monopoly regime.

315
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
Based on these two points

316
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
We should have two purposes in mind.

317
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,680
That we should strongly support justice.

318
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
That the civilians over the government.

319
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,280
Good point!

320
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
This kind of situation requires

321
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
a loud and firm voice like that.

322
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,520
Why do you have to go to extremes?

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
Why do you have to do this?

324
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,400
It's meaningless sacrifice.

325
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:11,920


326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,440
Have you heard from the Students Union?

327
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
Zhongxia and the others are in a meeting now.

328
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
We are working on countermeasures.

329
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,320
What do you think?

330
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
My attitude and thoughts are all in this article.

331
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,880
Fight to the end.

332
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
Of course, we should consider Shizhi's opinion.

333
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
Don't make unnecessary sacrifices.

334
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
I agree with Mr. Zhongfu's proposal.

335
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,760
Power should aside with axiom.

336
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
People's common will is above the government.

337
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,040
We must never give in.

338
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,240
Not to the ferocity of the reactionaries.

339
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
So tomorrow, the pro-Shandong groups from all schools

340
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
will be on the street

341
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
and escort the ten-people lecture groups.

342
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,640
Worst case scenario.

343
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Let's play hardball with the police.

344
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Yes, we are not yielding.

345
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
This is brute-force, Liu Haiwei.

346
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
Don't be foolhardy.

347
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
You misinterpreted Mr. Zhongfu's meaning.

348
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,680
Just now, Mr. Yang Fu has made it very clear.

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
We can't make unnecessary sacrifices any more.

350
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
We should pay attention to methods and strategies.

351
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,480
I think at this time

352
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
We should take a step back, cancel the strike.

353
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,600
Then turn to a legit approach.

354
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,760
If we do as you say,

355
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,800
taking a step back,

356
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,440
we might as well give up and surrender.

357
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,960
My Brother Shouchang

358
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,680
How can you be

359
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
reckless like some of the students.

360
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,040
You are a tutor for the youth.

361
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,040
What you should do now is to calm them down.

362
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
Instead of adding fuel to the fire

363
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Shizhi, you are wrong.

364
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
Now exactly is the time to add fuel to the fire.

365
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,960
That's what we should do.

366
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
Students' patriotic enthusiasm

367
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
is on fire now,

368
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
We need to make it burning even stronger,

369
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,520
so strong that it illuminates the whole society,

370
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
and set that patriotic enthusiasm on fire all over China.

371
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
So we can save our country.

372
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,680
Good point!

373
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
You are students of Peking University.

374
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Can you not tell what's right and wrong?

375
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Brother Shouchang,

376
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
You will pay for your applause one day.

377
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,320
Pour oil onto the fire.

378
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,160
Are you trying to burn yourself

379
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,560
and the whole Peking University to death now?

380
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,440
Shizhi

381
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
I know you have opinions and emotions, you can come at me.

382
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,520
Are you trying to dragging everyone backwards now?

383
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,880
We didn't take extreme measures.

384
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
Beiyang government did.

385
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
The police wounded the youth.

386
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
They took the students, didn't you see?

387
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
You are a teacher.

388
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,360
Can you really leave it alone?

389
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
Mr. Shouchang.

390
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,760
Anything from Students Union?

391
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,040
Classmates

392
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,920
We have just received a telegram from Paris.

393
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,760
The telegram says

394
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
The envoy of Paris is sparing no efforts to take their stand.

395
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,440
Overseas Chinese in Paris are also marching to fight.

396
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,840
Please don't give up.

397
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,760
Be sure to stick to it.

398
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
So the Beijing Students' Federation

399
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
the provisional congress unanimously decided

400
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,160
thirty-six affiliated schools will continue to strike.

401
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
Fight to the very end.

402
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
Never give up until we reach our goal.

403
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
good

404
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,640
At the same time, the Federation also decided,

405
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,960
in order to reduce unnecessary sacrifice

406
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,040
ten-people lecture groups in Beijing

407
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,240
will cancel demonstrations and demonstrations.

408
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,480
It can be replaced by other ways.

409
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
By selling domestic products

410
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,720
and mobilize citizens to boycott Japanese goods.

411
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
Boycott the Paris Peace Treaty,

412
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,520
So please all the students in all classes of Peking University.

413
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
Hurry up and prepare domestic products.

414
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,840
Tomorrow we take the action to the streets.

415
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Classmates

416
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
This message Deng Zhongxia

417
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,200
brought from the Federation of Students

418
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,560
is what I just said.

419
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,000
Take one step back.

420
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,000
Everyone please think it over

421
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
and bear in mind.

422
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,160
We respect the opinions of the Students Federation.

423
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,200
But,

424
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
this article "Shandong Problem and National Consciousness"

425
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
will still be published in the< Weekly Review>.

426
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
Let's split up.

427
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
Go into action

428
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,800
Shizhi

429
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,360
I was pushing too hard just now.

430
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,400
In front of your students

431
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,680
I didn't consider your stand.

432
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,520
I understand you have anger in your heart.

433
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
Brother Zhongfu, I know you are not trageting me but the situation.

434
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm fine.

435
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,800
You are faking.

436
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,040
There is no lie between us.

437
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,800
No matter what do you think,

438
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,040
I have to say this.

439
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,000
With the present situation at this critical moment,

440
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
do you really think our country

441
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
can afford to take a step back?

442
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,640
Even just one step,

443
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,040
do we still deserve to be a citizen of this country by then?

444
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,560
If you still disagree,

445
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,920
I'll buy you a drink another day.

446
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
Domestic products, support domestic products.

447
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
Auntie, some canned food?

448
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Would you like canned food?

449
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Sell domestic products

450
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,880
Have a look

451
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,000
Please take one.

452
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
I'll have one.

453
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,800
Thank you

454
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
Okay, thank you. Thank you

455
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
Please support domestic products. Thank you.

456
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,880
Auntie, some canned food?

457
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,680
Cookies?

458
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,200
Domestic goods.

459
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,640
Sell domestic products

460
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,480
Tooth powder, toothbrush, canned food.

461
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
Support domestic products

462
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
Tooth powder, toothbrush, canned food.

463
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,560
Fengzai.

464
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
Chen Duxiu is the general behind the whole student movement.

465
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
Before

466
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,560
He used Cai Yuanpei control students.

467
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
Now, he is using publications to lead students.

468
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
Do you have any thoughts about him?

469
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,560
I

470
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,760
Come sit down.

471
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,920
Take your time and have some tea.

472
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,880
Yes

473
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I think the easiest way

474
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,920
is convict him of incitement

475
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
arrest him and sentence him.

476
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,560
That won't do.

477
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
Chen Duxiu has a great social influence.

478
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,280
If we have no evidence to support conviction,

479
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,640
it will only intensify contradictions,

480
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
cause more unrest.

481
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,120
Not good

482
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
Then we isolate him.

483
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
Let him be embattled.

484
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,120
Leave him no mind to think about the students.

485
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Looks like you have some ideas to share.

486
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Talk about it. 

487
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Chen Duxiu is a grumpy man.

488
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,080
He offends people on a regular basis.

489
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
He has many enemies in Peking University.

490
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,160
Especially Gu Hongming, Huang Kan and Liu Shipei.

491
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
They are a few influential and respected professors.

492
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,680
They all disagree with Chen Duxiu,

493
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,440
they don't think highly of how he pushed the students movement

494
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
Besides, Chen Duxiu is now

495
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,600
no longer a senior of liberal arts at Peking University.

496
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,960
It's a good time to instigate these people,

497
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
have them go after him.

498
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
This opportunity can also be used to

499
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,520
disintegrate the student movement.

500
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,040
Aren't you from Peking University?

501
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,160
You can do this.

502
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I was expelled from Peking University.

503
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,160
It's not that I don't want to do it

504
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,600
My words doesn't matter.

505
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm afraid that it's you with power

506
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,480
can make a difference.

507
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,120
What can you do then?

508
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,840
I can find his son.

509
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,560
Chen Duxiu's son?

510
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,120
Right

511
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,240
Explain.

512
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
Chen Duxiu has three sons and one daughter with ex-wife.

513
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,880
The eldest son Chen Yannian and the second son Chen Qiaonian

514
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,960
are all live with him in Beijing now.

515
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,080
These two

516
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,680
don't go long well with Chen Duxiu.

517
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,040
Especially Chen Yannian.

518
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,120
He believes in anarchism, stubborn as hell.

519
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,400
He was wounded the other day

520
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,280
when he gave speech in Qianmen.

521
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
He's still in the hospital.

522
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
I can try to turn him around.

523
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
See if we can use him

524
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,280
To restrain Chen Duxiu.

525
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,480
Put aside what you're doing.

526
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,040
Concentrate on this matter.

527
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
I'll allocate special funds for you.

528
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,040
I'll give you credits when it's done.

529
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,720
Thank you, Chief.

530
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,040
Remember

531
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
Don't expose your identity in the police department

532
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,040
while you are doing this.

533
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,320
Rest assured.

534
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
I am only the editor-in-chief of the column of "Gazette"

535
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,800
Go ahead

536
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
Fengzai

537
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
Isn't your uncle a congressman?

538
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,000
He has good relationships with 

539
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,920
Gu Hongming, Liu Shipei and Huang Kan.

540
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,920
Right

541
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
We will have Director Li of the Ministry of Education

542
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,360
to arrange a meeting for them all.

543
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,960
What do you think?

544
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,520
Good!

545
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,960
This is a wonderful plan.

546
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,320
I'll inform my uncle.

547
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,440
Go ahead

548
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,760
Such a bad timing for

549
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
Director Li inviting the three of us to dinner.

550
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,800
What does he want?

551
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
I really don't know.

552
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,120
Director Li of the Ministry of Education claimed that

553
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
he has admired us three for long,

554
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,560
he wants to make friends with us.

555
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,760
So,

556
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,560
Zhang Changli hosted this banquet for us today,

557
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,320
said to introduce each other.

558
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,680
Zhang Changli?

559
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,160
Why didn't you say this earlier?

560
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,080
This is an ambush banquet, up to no good.

561
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,120
I'm leaving.

562
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,680
Tanggong

563
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
Tanggong

564
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,200
We are here already anyway.

565
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm sure he won't make it hard for us.

566
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,880
Why don't we wait and see?

567
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,480
You are here.

568
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,240
Tanggong

569
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
Jigang, Shenshu.

570
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,800
Let me introduce.

571
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
This is the one who will be promoted to the vice minister of education.

572
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,120
Director Li

573
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,760
Tanggong

574
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,160
Please, please

575
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,160
This way.

576
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,680
Come.

577
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Please.

578
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,760
Please sit here, please sit down.

579
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,760
Please sit down.

580
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,560
Masters, how about we sit on the second floor.

581
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,400
All right then, please

582
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,440
Dare to ask you two,

583
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,000
what is this banquet for today?

584
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,960
I don't take credits without doing due work.

585
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,400
This Gu Hongming never just sit down without knowing the reason for the invitation.

586
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,720
I'd ask you two to make it clear.

587
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,520
Masters,

588
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,400
please, let's go upstairs and then talk.

589
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,720
Please please please please

590
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,160
please

591
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,680
You two, pardon my language.

592
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,320
I am not the brave type.

593
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
I am worried just sitting here.

594
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,480
Dare not to drink without knowing something at least.

595
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,600
Please explain to us.

596
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
I am here today.

597
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,400
I came here and I took the seat.

598
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,400
I have given you two due respect.

599
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,640
If you don't make it clear,

600
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,600
then I'm afraid I have to leave.

601
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
It's nothing major.

602
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,360
Director Li will take office soon.

603
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
He just wants to make friends with you three.

604
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,160
Please, no need to overthink.

605
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,160
Let's talk over dinner on the second floor.

606
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,120
please

607
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,240
please

608
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,480
please

609
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,560
This

610
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,280
Look at this

611
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,400
this

612
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,080
Look at this

613
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
Director Li

614
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,480
All three here are honorable people.

615
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,920
Then let's be honest.

616
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
All right, all right.

617
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,440
Masters!

618
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,440
I, in the Ministry of Education,

619
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,400
take the responsibility of managing the university.

620
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Since the May 4th Movement

621
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,960
under the incitement of Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao,

622
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,120
Hu Shi and others,

623
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,840
the strike has went on for almost a month in Peking University

624
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,360
Education in Beijing has been completely paralyzed.

625
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,000
What a heavy loss!

626
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,080
It's painful to only imagine about this.

627
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
For my country,

628
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
and for my own duty,

629
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,800
I would like to ask the masters here

630
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,360
to step out and bring justice back,

631
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,200
to resume class and start teaching again as soon as possible.

632
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,800
I'm begging you.

633
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
Tanggong

634
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,720
If the three of you can go to the lecture

635
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,720
resume teaching,

636
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,560
not only that is Peking University's great luck,

637
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,760
but also the country's luck.

638
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,920
Director Li knows that the three of you

639
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,760
have been suppressed by Chen Duxiu for years,

640
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,360
not having the chance to pursue your ambition.

641
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,160
Yes

642
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,240
He is very willing to do his best for you.

643
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,760
Stand up for us?

644
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,800
Yes

645
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,760
Good!

646
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,760
What's the first step?

647
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
I'd like to hear all about it.

648
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,200
That's it.

649
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,400
If the three masters can help the government

650
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,040
restoring teaching order as soon as possible,

651
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
you will be the heroes of Peking University.

652
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
I am willing to promise you three,

653
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,440
that you will take charge of Peking University

654
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,600
together with Hu Renyuan, the new headmaster of Peking University. 

655
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,880
How's that?

656
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,200
Now I see why I feel baffled this whole day.

657
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,920
Turned out I am seeing a weirdo today.

658
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,720
Although I don't agree with Cai Yuanpei

659
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi's cultural viewpoints.

660
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,360
I haven't forgotten that I am a Chinese.

661
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,800
I absolutely do not approve

662
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,040
this government trying to just accept this traitorous Paris agreement.

663
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,720
I don't agree with the students' strike.

664
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,640
But,

665
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,920
I will never sell my students out.

666
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,120
You are looking down on me.

667
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,960
Thinking a banquet can buy me off.

668
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
You shamelss bastards!

669
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,000
With you evil schemes!

670
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,920
Masters, please don't go. 

671
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,400
There is a boarderline one will never across!

672
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,180
This

673
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,720
What is this.

674
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,200
This is all on that moroan Wu Bingxiang.

675
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,880
He screwed things up.

676
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,400
This this this

677
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,440
Wrong door.

678
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,040
Young man

679
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,320
See

680
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,800
I heard that you were gloriously wounded.

681
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,000
I was entrusted by the Publicity Department of Beijing Students Federation.

682
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
A little gift to show my respect.

683
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,240
Gift.

684
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,840
the Propaganda Department of Beijing Students Federation.

685
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,520
Aren't you already expelled from Peking University?

686
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,960
How can you be in the publicity department?

687
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,640
Dude!

688
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,840
True, I was expelled from Peking University.

689
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,520
But I am now.

690
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,800
Editor-in-Chief of coloumn Xuehai Chunqiu in <Gazette>.

691
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,920
This coloumn supports the student movement.

692
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
It is under the leadership of the Publicity Department of Beijing Federation of Students.

693
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,240
Especically responsible for reporting student sports.

694
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,400
Isn't <Gazette> a newspaper of Anfu Group?

695
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,040
You support patriotism now?

696
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,560
What with Anfu Group?

697
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,320
There are patriots in the Anfu Group.

698
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,760
Take me for example.

699
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,200
Although I don't approve

700
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,560
with this new culture.

701
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,600
I don't approve of your work-study mutual assistance.

702
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
But I firmly oppose to the Paris Peace Treaty.

703
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,760
My hometown is also Shandong.

704
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,920
I will never allow Shandong being handed over

705
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,120
to the Japanese.

706
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,320
There are also traitors in Shandong.

707
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,240
If you are really care about this country,

708
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,520
you should go and do something practical.

709
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
Talking nonsense to me here is useless.

710
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,880
Hey

711
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,760
You can't look at people in the old way.

712
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
This column Xuehai Chunqiu I run

713
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,840
is appointed by Beijing Students Federation

714
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,520
as a column to publicize the student movement.

715
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,220
Take a look.

716
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
This is my journalist certificate.

717
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,320
Look

718
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,520
picture

719
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,160
stamp

720
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,920
For real, I am not lying.

721
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,720
I see.

722
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
So you are a different person now.

723
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,640
Congratulations then.

724
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,920
I need to go exercising.

725
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,980
Don't go.

726
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
You are a wounded hero.

727
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,800
You are also the eldest son of Chen Duxiu, leader of the student movement.

728
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,200
I was assigned to interview you.

729
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,640
I want to write a report for you.

730
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,680
Interview again?

731
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,320
Last time, you used interview to set up Liu Mei.

732
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,600
You want to set me up this time?

733
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,960
Don't mention Liu Mei to me.

734
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
I get angry when you mention Liu Mei.

735
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,440
Besides, who set whom in the last interview?

736
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,280
You know better than I do.

737
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,800
Didn't you ask for it?

738
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,560
I'll tell you clearly.

739
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't accept interview.

740
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't waste time here.

741
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,320
Fine, then we won't do interview today.

742
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,000
I'll just tell you something, all right?

743
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
About your father Chen Duxiu.

744
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,400
Not interested.

745
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't go yet. Sit down.

746
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,040
Listen to me

747
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,720
This is very important. Sit down.

748
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,840
You see.

749
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,320
Recently, our column "XueHai ChunQiu"

750
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,280
received letters from readers and some leaflets.

751
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,080
It's all about your father.

752
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,560
Excuse me.

753
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,040
It's all neagtive for your father 

754
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,480
Chen Duxiu.

755
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,560
We don't know what to do with it.

756
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,360
I want to hear your opinion.

757
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,040
What, you don want to look?

758
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
Ever since he came to the Peking University,

759
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,680
there are people talking shit about him everyday.

760
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
Newspapers even framed rumors.

761
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,080
You take these rotten old news to me.

762
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,360
What's the point?

763
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,920
You read carefullly.

764
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,160
This isn't some rotten old news.

765
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
This is the fact.

766
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,440
This pile,

767
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,360
it's all the statements from witnesses.

768
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,880
Read for yourself.

769
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,320
This is Chen Duxiu's business, and you ask for my opinion.

770
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
What's your intention here?

771
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,440
Ah, 

772
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,480
I was being kind.

773
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
Think about it. I have all these materials.

774
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,440
Once it's in the newspaper

775
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
it's gonna be explosive.

776
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,920
Then just don't put it out.

777
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,760
It's not up to me whether it'll go public or not.

778
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,280
Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei,

779
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,560
I don't like these two,

780
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,400
but I know what's the real issue here.

781
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,360
It is the critical moment of the student movement right now,

782
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
with Cai Yuanpei left,

783
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Chen Duxiu is recognized as the public mentor for the youth.

784
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Some people even say

785
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,200
that he was the commander behind the May 4th Movement.

786
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,480
At this critical moment,

787
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
a big scandal of a key figure like him

788
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,160
will be destructive

789
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
to the student movement.

790
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,400
Do you know?

791
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
I, as a

792
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,840
Editor-in-chief of a newspaper column under the leadership of a student union.

793
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,560
I can't watch students movement collapse.

794
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Do you understand?

795
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,720
What should I do then?

796
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
You are his son.

797
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
It is your duty to stop your father.

798
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Don't do bad things at this time.

799
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,240
Stop shaming the student movement.

800
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,000
Newspapers attack him every day.

801
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,840
None of them were solid evidence.

802
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,680
Who is the witness?

803
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,680
Let him confront me.

804
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,960
If what he said is true

805
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,480
I, Chen Yannian

806
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,720
will disown Chen Duxiu immediately.

807
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,400
We Peking University...

808
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,760
Many of professors at Peking University are witnesses.

809
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,360
Who are these many professors?

810
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
If it's the retro group who against the new culture, 

811
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,960
I don't think I can fully believe their words.

812
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
Fine.

813
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
Then I'll give you two people.

814
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,760
Not in the retro group.

815
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,960
Shen Yinmo, the peer editor of New Youth

816
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,720
and an old friend of your father's,

817
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
Principal Tang Erhe of the Medical school.

818
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,920
These two back then,

819
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,360
they helped and recommended your father.

820
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,840
Not long ago, it was these two

821
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,520
strongly proposed to dismiss your father

822
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,120
from the senior position in liberal arts department.

823
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,440
Yannian

824
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,680
I know how you feel right now.

825
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
Knowing that my father is this kind of man.

826
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,720
I can understand how you feel now.

827
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,040
Well.

828
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,360
I'll leave these here.

829
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,400
Take a look when you are free.

830
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,360
Yannian

831
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,000
Facts are facts.

832
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,000
It's up to you

833
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,920
to face it or not.
