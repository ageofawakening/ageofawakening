00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:06,983
[Episode Thirty-one]

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,560
The reason why I brought Peking University up

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,600
Moving south to Shanghai

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,160
I want to keep Peking University.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,600
Stay in Qingshan

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,640
Not afraid of burning wood.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,440
That's all I am.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,480
This is a compromise.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
It's surrender

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,880
The reason why China is so timid

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,280
Because Guo Xingang is too little.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,200
There are too many Shi.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,720
中富兄

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,480
You calm down.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,480
I rashly proposed to move Peking University to Shanghai.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,400
Without consulting with you.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,720
I was wrong.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,040
Now the proposal and signature letter

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,240
It's all burnt down.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,160
It won't produce any shadow.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,400
Let's call it a day.

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,360
I'll buy you a drink another day.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,880
proffer a birch and ask for punishment by flogging―offer a humble and sincere apology

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Excuse me

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
Let's go. The police are coming. Let's go.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,280
Liu Mei

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Chen Yannian

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:41,920
go

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,160
go

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,360
go

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,320
Yannian

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,040
brother

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,480
Liu Mei

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
Yannian

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,160
Liu Mei

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,160
Yannian

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,760
brother

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,640
Yannian

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,000
刘梅姐

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,160
Yannian

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:02,960
brother

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,520
Who are you looking for in the dark?

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,640
Hello, uncle.

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,920
We are looking for two children.

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,080
A man and a woman are both in their twenties.

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,640
It's a lecture student, right?

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
Yes, I gave a speech here this afternoon.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,200
I said you should stop shouting here.

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
The students who give speeches here will not be driven away.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
Otherwise, they would have been taken away.

52
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
Then where else can we look?

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,200
You guys?

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,600
I think I'd better try my luck at Dashilan.

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,800
There are many shops over there

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,280
Dashilan

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,400
right

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Okay, thanks.

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,760
Just turn that way.

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,040
Yannian

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,840
Be careful.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,200
Yannian

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,800
hold one's own

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,800
Did you hear what I said?

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,160
You hear me? Hang in there

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,640
It'll be all right.

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,720
Be sure to hold on.

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,440
Yannian

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,760
Yannian

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,280
Chen Yannian

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,800
Liu Mei

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,360
Uncle Chen auntie

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,880
We are here.

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,440
Liu Mei

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
We are here.

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,840
Uncle Chen auntie, we are here.

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,240
Yannian was injured by the cavalry.

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,880
Wounded

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Yannian

80
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
Unconscious

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,440
Hurry to the hospital.

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
Come on, get up

83
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,280
Come and help

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,680
Send to hospital

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,040
come

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,920
rise

87
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,480
come

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:16,640


89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,240
come on

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,760
come

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,360
Qiaonian held an umbrella for them.

92
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,560
go

93
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:24,880


94
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,200


95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,440
Go that way.

96
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,320
Why are you up?

97
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,520
Sit down quickly

98
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,280
sit down

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,040
lie down

100
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,680
Why am I here?

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,760
You were wounded by the police.

102
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,560
Close to the French hospital

103
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
I sent you here.

104
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,960
not bad

105
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,600
Mild concussion

106
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
Liu Mei, where are they?

107
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
Liu Mei suffered a little back injury.

108
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,560
Got some cold.

109
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,520
Some fever.

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
He's also in the hospital.

111
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,640
But the doctor said it was okay.

112
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,480
Both of you are fine.

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,080
Just rest for a few days.

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
What about me auntie

115
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Why are you here alone?

116
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,160
I

117
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,280
I sent you here yesterday.

118
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
What happened yesterday inspired me a little.

119
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,760
Inspired

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,080
Want to write an article

121
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
Shandong Problems and National Consciousness

122
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
It's raining hard.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,200
I just want to do it all at once.

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,480
Just finish writing here.

125
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,920
I never went back.

126
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,080
Want to hear it?

127
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,840
Let me read you a paragraph.

128
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,680
eh

129
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,320
Now the warlords of China and Japan

130
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,960
Are they all enemies of justice?

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,240
Civilians of both countries

132
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
If you don't have to force them down.

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
Whatever you want.

134
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,520
Shout about axioms every day.

135
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,320
We can't advocate abandoning justice by force.

136
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,240
But we can't help advocating strong support for justice.

137
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
We don't advocate using force to crush people.

138
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,000
But we have to advocate it.

139
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
Be crushed by people with strong resistance

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
One person, one nation.

141
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
Without the strength of self-defense

142
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
Just hope that justice will flourish.

143
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,880
Rely on the grace of others' forgiveness and help

144
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,000
To survive.

145
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,880
How humble and shameless this is!

146
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
A self-reliant slave

147
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,040
Do you agree with me?

148
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,080
ah

149
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,080
What do you mean, always?

150
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,480
agree

151
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
But some people don't agree.

152
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,760
Who?

153
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,760
I called that back.

154
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
You are regarded as a young mentor

155
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
Professor Hu Shi

156
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
You are both up.

157
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,240
auntie

158
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
How's it going? Any better?

159
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,000
much better

160
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
Chen Bobo is good.

161
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,400
Are you feeling better?

162
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,840
much better

163
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,600
Are you okay? Are you still dizzy?

164
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,480
much better

165
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
What about you?

166
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm fine.

167
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,560
What were you two talking about just now?

168
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,520
Let me put down the small table.

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
I just wrote an article to read to him.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,040
Say you are really ignorant.

171
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
Still not sensible?

172
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,920
My son just woke up.

173
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,760
What article do you read to him?

174
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,400
And wanted him to take to the streets.

175
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
auntie

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Do you still organize street speeches?

177
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
I really don't know this.

178
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,640
I knew that Qiaonian was caught in the rain last night.

179
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
A little cold, too

180
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
I let him lie at home.

181
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,080
Yannian

182
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,680
You may not know.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,960
last night

184
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,040
Your father took you from the street himself.

185
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,480
Back to the hospital.

186
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,400
I wanted to stay and watch you.

187
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Your dad didn't agree to kick me out.

188
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,160
Want to stay alone?

189
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,440
I've been watching you all night.

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
Later, I wanted to

191
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
What are you talking about?

192
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
I'll leave when you come.

193
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Yasheng said that he would give an injection in the morning. Watch this.

194
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
I'll go to the red chamber to print this.

195
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
It's killing me.

196
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,080
Look at your whole body.

197
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Can't you go home for dinner and sleep?

198
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,600
Change clothes before you go.

199
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
Can't take care of it

200
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,440
The earth won't turn without you, will it?

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
Don't say I'm leaving at this time.

202
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,080
It's really possible that it won't turn.

203
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,160
this

204
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,240
Yannian

205
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,680
Let's eat first

206
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,480
good

207
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
Instruction of Ministry of Education

208
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,200
According to Premier Qian Nengxun

209
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,640
Signed reply order

210
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,080
In view of the present situation of various schools in Beijing before taking the initiative

211
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,920
Ministry of Education decided

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,720
Schools in Beijing will suspend classes from now on.

213
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,800
Early summer vacation

214
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,880
And the graduating class of each school

215
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,280
The graduation exam will be held as usual.

216
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,280
Students who do not take the graduation exam are not allowed to graduate.

217
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
Ministry of Education of the Republic of China

218
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,760
They really know how to play hardball.

219
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,760
What was hard yesterday is soft today.

220
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,520
It's a walk, a walk, a test.

221
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
It's really our weakness.

222
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,960
Mr. Shouchang, how do you say this

223
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,960
You want to have a school holiday?

224
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,520
It also means all the normal activities of the school.

225
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,640
It all stopped.

226
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,640
The library has stopped and the canteen has stopped.

227
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,920
The teacher went home.

228
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,800
Then it will be given to students.

229
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
Caused great difficulties.

230
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
Besides, since it's a holiday.

231
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
So always strike

232
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
It has little to do with the government.

233
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,840
What is going on?

234
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
In addition, the graduating class students have to take the exam.

235
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
The study of this graduating class

236
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
The total number of Lu strike three-thirds.

237
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,360
If they don't take the exam

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
Then you won't get your diploma.

239
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,640
Can't get a diploma

240
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,160
It's hard to find a job.

241
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
For their own future.

242
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
Be sure to take the exam.

243
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,040
But once you take the exam

244
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
It also means that they are going to resume classes.

245
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,920
Then the general strike will collapse.

246
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,040
That's a tough move.

247
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
What do you think we should do next?

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
the country is in peril

249
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
This group of superior people only know

250
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,640
Use soft knives on patriots.

251
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
Too little of our determination and will.

252
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
Inform student officers and professors.

253
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
Go to the library for a meeting.

254
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
Let's discuss the next step.

255
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,640
Okay, I'm on my way.

256
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,400
classmates

257
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,160
Since the Ministry of Education announced the suspension of classes

258
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
And the instructions for graduates to take the exam as usual.

259
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,640
It has a great influence on schools.

260
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,400
Beijing Agricultural College

261
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,080
Law school and other schools.

262
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
Many fresh graduates

263
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,040
The strike was cancelled automatically.

264
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,200
In addition, the State Council issued

265
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,800
About civil service in advance

266
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,880
And the news of the diplomatic judicial examination.

267
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,400
Also among some students.

268
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
Had a negative impact.

269
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,960
Look today.

270
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,640
The number of students on strike dropped sharply.

271
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,680
same time

272
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
Because of the severe repressive measures taken by the government

273
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,840
Wei part of the students' psychology.

274
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,120
Combined with military and police blockade.

275
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,200


276
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,600
Combined with military and police blockade.

277
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Today, a group of ten students from each school

278
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
All the demonstrations and speeches on the streets were cancelled.

279
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,200
What should I do next?

280
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,000
We must find effective ways and means.

281
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,160
Otherwise, the struggle will be unsustainable.

282
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,680
中富兄

283
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,200
Isn't Yannian injured?

284
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,160
What are you doing here?

285
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
Have you been diagnosed? What did the doctor say?

286
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,040
it doesn't matter

287
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,880
Yasheng checked, and it's fine.

288
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Haiwei

289
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
This was last night.

290
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,800
I wrote an article in the hospital.

291
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
You have someone carve wax paper and print leaflets.

292
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,880
Send it out today

293
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,280
good

294
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
Hai Wei, don't worry.

295
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,320
中富兄

296
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
Now the streets are full of military police and cavalry.

297
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
Banning speeches and distributing leaflets.

298
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
I read your article.

299
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Don't print it for now.

300
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,080
The situation is really tense now.

301
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,920
We can't push on like this.

302
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
Go on like this

303
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
A heavy loss outweighs the gain.

304
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
I was up all night

305
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
I wrote this article.

306
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,280
Just want to give someone like you

307
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,800
Dare not talk to the reactionary government

308
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
The right people look at it

309
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,040
Haiwei

310
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,120
Read it to everyone.

311
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,520
good

312
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
Our nationals are the Shandong issue.

313
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,360
There should be two kinds of thorough consciousness.

314
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,960
We can't rely solely on axiomatic consciousness.

315
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
Can't let a few people

316
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,120
Awareness of monopoly regime

317
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
By this thorough awakening

318
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
We should have two purposes in mind.

319
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,680
Is to strongly support justice.

320
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Civilians conquer the government

321
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,280
Good point!

322
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
Now this situation

323
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
That's all I need.

324
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,520
Why do you have to go to extremes?

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
Why do you have to do this?

326
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,400
What about meaningless sacrifice?

327
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:11,920
that

328
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,440
Have you heard from Lian?

329
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
Zhongxia, they have gone to the meeting.

330
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
We are discussing countermeasures.

331
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,320
What do you think?

332
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
My attitude is shown in this article.

333
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,880
Struggle resolutely

334
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
Of course, we should also consider Shizhi's opinion.

335
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
Don't make unnecessary sacrifices.

336
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
I agree with Mr. Zhongfu's proposal.

337
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,760
Strongly support axioms

338
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
The slogan of conquering the government by civilians

339
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,040
We must never give in.

340
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,240
The ferocity of the reactionaries

341
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
So tomorrow, our schools will

342
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
Luyidui steet

343
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
Escort the ten-member group.

344
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,640
really can't

345
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Let's play hardball with the police.

346
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Can't yield to

347
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
This is brute-force Liu Haiwei.

348
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
Can't be foolhardy

349
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
You misinterpreted Mr. Zhongfu's meaning.

350
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,680
Just now, Mr. Yang Fu has made it very clear.

351
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
We can't make such unnecessary sacrifices any more.

352
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
We should pay attention to methods and strategies.

353
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,480
I think at this time

354
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
We must retreat and cancel the strike.

355
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,600
Take a legal struggle

356
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,760
In your present situation

357
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,800
If you take the slide backwards,

358
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,440
That is to cancel the struggle and surrender.

359
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,960
My Shouchang brother

360
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,680
How can you look like

361
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
Some students are just as reckless.

362
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,040
You are a youth tutor.

363
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,040
What you should do now is to calm down.

364
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
Instead of adding fuel to the fire

365
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Shizhi, you are wrong

366
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
Now is the time to add fuel to the fire.

367
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,960
What we should do now is add fuel to the fire.

368
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
Students' patriotic enthusiasm

369
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
It's all burning up.

370
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
We need to add another fire.

371
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,520
Let it illuminate the whole society.

372
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
Let the patriotic enthusiasm of all China burn.

373
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
So as to save our country.

374
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,680
Good point!

375
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
As students of Peking University

376
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Don't you tell the difference?

377
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,800
寿昌兄

378
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
You have to pay for your applause.

379
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,320
pour oil on the fire

380
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,160
Are you trying to make yourself

381
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,560
Is the whole Peking University burned to death?

382
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:04,800


383
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,440
Shizhi

384
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
You have opinions and emotions, you come at me.

385
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,520
Are you throwing cold water on everyone?

386
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,880
We're not going to extremes.

387
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
Beiyang government is going to extremes.

388
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
The police wounded the child.

389
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
Took the students, didn't you see?

390
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
You are a teacher.

391
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,360
Can you leave it alone?

392
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
寿昌先生

393
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,760
How about Lian?

394
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,040
classmates

395
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,920
We have just received a telegram from Paris.

396
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,760
The telegram says

397
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
The envoy of Paris is struggling to persist.

398
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,440
Overseas Chinese in Paris are also marching to resist.

399
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,840
Please don't give up.

400
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,760
Be sure to stick to it.

401
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
So the Beijing Students' Federation

402
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
The provisional congress unanimously decided

403
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,160
Thirty-six affiliated schools continue to strike.

404
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
Stick to the struggle to the end.

405
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
Never give up until you take the risk.

406
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
good

407
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,640
At the same time, the Federation also decided

408
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,960
In order to reduce unnecessary sacrifice

409
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,040
Ten-member group of Beijing schools

410
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,240
Cancel demonstrations and demonstrations.

411
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,480
It can be replaced by other ways.

412
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
By selling domestic products.

413
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,720
Mobilize citizens to boycott Japanese goods.

414
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
Boycott the Paris Peace Treaty

415
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,520
So please all the students in all classes of Peking University.

416
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
Hurry up and prepare domestic products.

417
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,840
Shangjie tomorrow

418
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,400
classmates

419
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
刚才邓中夏同学

420
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,200
Brought the news of the Federation of Students

421
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,560
That's what I just said.

422
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,000
The idea of retreating.

423
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,000
Everyone should think it over.

424
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
Absorb

425
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,160
We respect the opinions of the Federation of Students.

426
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,200
but

427
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
This article "Shandong Problem and National Consciousness"

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
Or should it be published in the Weekly Review?

429
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
Let's split up.

430
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
Go into action

431
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,800
Shizhi

432
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,360
I know I was exaggerating just now.

433
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,400
In front of your students

434
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,680
I didn't save you face.

435
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,520
You must have emotions in your heart.

436
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
Brother Zhongfu, I know you are dealing with things.

437
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,360
It doesn't matter to me here.

438
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,800
You tell lies.

439
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,040
We don't need to tell lies.

440
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,800
No matter what kind of mood you have.

441
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,040
I have to tell you one more thing.

442
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,000
The present situation is at this festival.

443
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
Do you think our country

444
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
Can you go back any further?

445
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,640
If you return it again

446
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,040
Do we have the face to be citizens of this country?

447
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,560
If you can't digest it.

448
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,920
I'll buy you a drink another day.

449
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
Sell domestic products and support domestic products

450
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
Do you want a large can?

451
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Would you like a can?

452
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Sell domestic products

453
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,880
have a look

454
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,000
This is what you want.

455
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
Just give me one.

456
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,800
Thank you

457
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
Okay, thank you. Thank you

458
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
Please support domestic products. Thank you.

459
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,880
Do you want a large can?

460
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,680
Do you want cookies?

461
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:17,760


462
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:17,840


463
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,160
Maiguohuo building

464
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,640
Sell domestic products

465
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:18,800
Maiguolou

466
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,480
Canned tooth powder toothbrush

467
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:20,640
Canned tooth powder

468
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:20,880
Canned tooth powder toothbrush

469
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,840
Sell domestic products

470
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
Support domestic products

471
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
Canned tooth powder

472
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,560
Toyoda

473
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
Chen Duxiu is the general background of the student movement.

474
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
What about him before?

475
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,560
Cai Yuanpei is used to control students.

476
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
Now he is using publications to guide students.

477
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
Do you have any thoughts about him?

478
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,560
I

479
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,760
Come sit down.

480
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,920
Take your time and have some tea.

481
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,880
good

482
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I think the most convenient way

483
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,920
Is to move the crime.

484
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
Just arrest him and sentence him.

485
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,560
That won't do.

486
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
What about Chen Duxiu? It has a great influence on society.

487
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,280
If we have no evidence to arrest him rashly

488
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,640
Will intensify contradictions.

489
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
Will cause more unrest.

490
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,120
Not good

491
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
Then try to isolate him.

492
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
Let him be embattled.

493
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Let him have no mind anymore.

494
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,120
To worry about the students.

495
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Looks like you've got a great idea.

496
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Let's talk about it. Let's talk about it

497
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Chen Duxiu is often grumpy.

498
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,080
Offending people everywhere

499
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
He has many old enemies in Peking University.

500
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,160
Especially Gu Hongming, Huang Kan and Liu Shipei.

501
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
Wait for a few influential and influential professors.

502
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,680
Different from his point of view

503
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,440
Yeah, Chen Duxiu incited students to play sports.

504
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
Very disapproving.

505
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
And Chen Duxiu is now

506
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm no longer a senior of liberal arts at Peking University.

507
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,960
It is these people who instigate it.

508
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
It's a good time to go after him.

509
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
You can also preposition opportunity.

510
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,520
Disintegrate the student movement

511
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,040
Aren't you from Peking University?

512
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,160
You do this.

513
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I was expelled from Peking University.

514
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,160
It's not that I don't want to do it

515
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,600
I speak lightly.

516
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm afraid you have to be your family.

517
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,480
Go into battle yourself.

518
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,120
What can you do then?

519
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,840
I can find his son.

520
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,560
陈独秀他儿子

521
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,120
right

522
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,240
Tell us your opinion

523
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
Chen Duxiu has three men and one woman with the original.

524
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,880
The eldest son Chen Yannian and the second son Chen Qiaonian

525
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,960
They all live with him in Beijing now.

526
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,080
Her two sons

527
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,680
I'm born with Chen Duxiu.

528
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,040
Especially Chen Yannian.

529
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,120
Believe in anarchism.

530
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,400
No, I was speaking at the front door the other day.

531
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,280
Also let a person wounded.

532
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
He's still in the hospital.

533
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
I can try to turn him around.

534
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
See if we can get through him.

535
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,280
To restrain Chen Duxiu.

536
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,480
Put aside what you're doing.

537
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,040
Concentrate on this matter

538
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
I'll allocate special funds for you.

539
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,040
I'll give you a credit when it's done.

540
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,720
Director Xie

541
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,040
remember

542
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
Don't be exposed at work.

543
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,040
Your identity in the police department

544
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,320
Rest assured.

545
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
I am the editor-in-chief of the column of "Gazette"

546
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,800
Go ahead

547
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
Fengzai

548
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
Isn't your uncle a congressman?

549
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,000
He and Gu Hongming Liu Shipei Huang

550
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,920
Good relationship

551
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,920
right

552
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
We call Director Li of the Ministry of Education.

553
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,360
Ask your uncle to meet these professors.

554
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,960
What do you think?

555
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,520
Good!

556
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,960
This is a wonderful plan.

557
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,320
I'll inform my uncle.

558
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,440
Go ahead

559
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,120
465

560
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,600
465

561
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,080
465

562
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,240


563
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:42,720


564
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:48,960
46

565
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,760
In this noisy time.

566
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
Director Li invited the three of us to dinner.

567
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,800
What does he want?

568
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
I really don't know.

569
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,120
Director Li of the Ministry of Education.

570
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
Long-awaited three people's fame.

571
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,560
Want to make friends with me.

572
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,760
so

573
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,560
Zhang Changli hosted a banquet for me today.

574
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,320
Said to introduce you to each other.

575
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,680
Zhang Changli

576
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,160
Why didn't you say so earlier?

577
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,080
This is the hongmen banquet.

578
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,120
return

579
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,680
Tang gong

580
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
Tang gong

581
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,200
Let's settle down when we come.

582
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm sure he can't come up with a big name.

583
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,880
Why don't we wait and see?

584
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,480
You can come.

585
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,240
Tang gong

586
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
Uncle Ji Shenshu

587
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,800
Let me introduce you.

588
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
This is the one who will be promoted to the second minister of education.

589
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,120
Director Li

590
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,760
Tang Gong 'a

591
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,160
Please, please

592
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,160
Kandaoer

593
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,680
come

594
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Please.

595
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,760
Please sit down, please sit down.

596
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,760
Please sit down.

597
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,560
Three masters, let's sit on the second floor.

598
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,400
All right, please

599
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,440
Dare to ask you two?

600
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,000
Why am I waiting for a banquet today?

601
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm not affected by reactive power.

602
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,400
I Gu Hongming never eat nameless seats.

603
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,720
I'd better ask you two to make it clear.

604
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,520
three's place

605
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,400
Three, let's go upstairs and join the discussion.

606
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,720
Please please please please

607
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,160
please

608
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,680
Two places

609
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,320
I am naturally timid.

610
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
Today, I am deeply in love.

611
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,480
Dare not drink this nameless wine.

612
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,600
Please tell us why.

613
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
I am old today.

614
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,400
Come and sit and sit.

615
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,400
Face is enough for you.

616
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,640
If you don't make it clear

617
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,600
Then I'll grease my feet and slip away.

618
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
Actually, it's nothing.

619
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,760
Li Zhangchang takes office soon.

620
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,360
Director Li will take office soon.

621
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
I just want to make friends with three people.

622
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,160
Three don't have to sweat it.

623
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,160
Let's talk over dinner on the second floor.

624
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,120
please

625
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,240
please

626
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,480
please

627
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,560
This

628
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,280
Look at this

629
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,400
this

630
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,080
Look at this

631
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
Director Li

632
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,480
All three are temperamental people.

633
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,920
Then let's be honest.

634
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
All right, all right.

635
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,440
Three masters!

636
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,440
Brother in the Ministry of Education

637
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,400
Take the responsibility of managing the university.

638
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Since the May 4th Movement

639
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,960
北京大学在陈独秀李大钊

640
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,120
And Hu Shi and others.

641
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,840
It's been nearly a month since the strike.

642
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,360
Education in Beijing has been completely paralyzed.

643
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,000
What a heavy loss!

644
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,080
It's painful to think of these things.

645
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
For my country.

646
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
And for my own duty.

647
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,800
I would like to ask all the masters to be able to

648
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,360
Be able to help justice.

649
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,200
Go to the lecture hall early to resume teaching.

650
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,800
I'm begging you.

651
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
Tang gong

652
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,720
If the three of you can go to the lecture hall

653
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,720
Resume teaching

654
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,560
This is Peking University's great education.

655
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,760
The country is fortunate.

656
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,920
Director Li knows three people.

657
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,760
Been suppressed by Chen Duxiu for many years

658
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,360
Have been depressed and frustrated.

659
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,160
yes

660
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,240
He is very willing to do his best for the three leaders.

661
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,760
Stand up for us

662
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,800
yes

663
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,760
Good!

664
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,760
What's the first step?

665
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
I'd like to hear all about it.

666
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,200
That's it.

667
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,400
If the three masters can help the government

668
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,040
Restore teaching order as soon as possible

669
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
You are the heroes of Peking University.

670
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
Brothers are willing to protect three masters.

671
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,440
And Hu Renyuan, the new president of Peking University.

672
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,600
Take charge of Peking University together

673
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,880
how about

674
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,200
I said, why am I so confused today?

675
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,920
It turned out to be a ghost.

676
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,720
Although I don't agree with Cai Yuanpei

677
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
Chen Duxiu Hu Shi's Cultural View

678
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,360
But I haven't forgotten that I am a Chinese.

679
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,800
I absolutely don't like queen.

680
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,040
The government signed this traitorous Paris agreement.

681
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,720
I don't agree with the students' strike

682
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,640
but

683
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,920
And I will never betray my students.

684
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,120
You look down on me.

685
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,960
A table banquet can buy me off.

686
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
You gangsters!

687
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,000
The heart can be punished.

688
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,920
Three, don't go. Three

689
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,400
Don't be so shameless

690
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,880
This

691
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,080
this

692
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,720
this

693
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,200
Blame Wu Bingxiang for being such an asshole.

694
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,880
He screwed things up.

695
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,400
This this this

696
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,440
Wrong door, right?

697
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,040
young man

698
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,320
this

699
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,800
I heard that bro was gloriously wounded.

700
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,000
I was entrusted by the Propaganda Department of Beijing Federation of Students.

701
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
It's not respectful to visit specially.

702
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,240
this is a mere token of my indebtedness

703
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,840
Xuelian publicity department

704
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,520
Aren't you already expelled from Peking University?

705
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,960
How to become the propaganda department again?

706
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,640
Dude!

707
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,840
I was expelled from Peking University.

708
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,920
But I am now.

709
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,280
"Gazette"

710
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,800
Editor-in-Chief of Xuehai Chunqiu

711
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,920
Our program supports the student movement.

712
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of Beijing Federation of Students.

713
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,240
Responsible for reporting student sports.

714
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,400
Isn't "Gazette" a newspaper of Anfu Department?

715
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,040
Now you also support patriotism.

716
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,560
What happened to Anfu?

717
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,320
There are patriots in the Fu family.

718
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,760
Take me for example.

719
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,200
Although I don't approve.

720
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,560
What's your new culture?

721
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,600
I don't approve of your work-study mutual assistance.

722
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
But I am firmly opposed to the Paris Peace Treaty.

723
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,760
My hometown is also from Shandong.

724
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,920
I will never allow Shandong

725
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,120
Give it to the Japanese

726
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,320
There are also traitors in Shandong.

727
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,240
If you are really patriotic

728
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,520
Just go to the thousand points and do something practical.

729
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
Don't talk to me about this here.

730
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,880
I said bro.

731
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,760
You can't look at people under the door.

732
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
My editor-in-chief column Xuehai Chunqiu

733
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,840
But it was appointed by Beijing Federation of Students.

734
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,520
A column to publicize the student movement

735
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,120


736
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,280
Come and see.

737
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,440
Come and see.

738
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,520


739
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:31,920
Come and see.

740
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
This is my interview card.

741
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,320
Look at this

742
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,520
picture

743
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,160
jab

744
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,920
The real thing is not to be cheated.

745
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,720
auv nana

746
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
Don't look at yourself in March.

747
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,640
Be happy first.

748
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,920
I go out for activities.

749
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,320
You don't go

750
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
You are a wounded hero.

751
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,800
He is also the eldest son of Chen Duxiu, leader of the student movement.

752
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,200
I was ordered to interview you.

753
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,640
I want to write a report for you.

754
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,680
Interview again

755
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,320
Last time, I used the interview trick to set Liu Mei's words.

756
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,600
You want to set me up this time.

757
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,960
Don't mention Liu Mei to me.

758
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
I get angry when you mention Liu Mei.

759
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,440
Besides, who set who in the last interview?

760
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,280
You know better than I do.

761
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,800
Didn't you ask for it?

762
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,560
I'll tell you clearly.

763
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't give interviews.

764
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't waste time here.

765
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,320
Fine, then we won't interview today.

766
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,000
Can I tell you something?

767
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
About your father Chen Duxiu

768
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,600
Not interested in listening.

769
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't go yet. Sit down.

770
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,040
you listen to me

771
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,720
This is always important. Sit down.

772
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,840
That's it.

773
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,320
Recently, our column "Learning the Sea Spring and Autumn"

774
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,280
Received many letters from readers and some leaflets.

775
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,120


776
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,080
It's all about your father

777
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,560
excuse me/ sorry /feel bad/can't bring myself to ...

778
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,040
It's all about your father Chen Duxiu

779
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,480
A very unfavorable thing

780
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,560
We don't know what to do with it.

781
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,360
I want to hear your opinion.

782
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,040
What do you mean, don't look?

783
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
Chen Duxiu, since coming to the University

784
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,680
There are people who think about other things every day.

785
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
Newspapers even framed rumors.

786
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,080
You take these old sesame seeds and rotten millet things

787
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,360
What's the point of telling me?

788
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,920
You see clearly.

789
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,160
This isn't the news of stale sesame seeds and rotten millet.

790
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
This is the present fact.

791
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,440
This pile

792
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,360
It's all the statements of the risk taker.

793
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,880
it's up to you

794
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,320
You asked my opinion about Chen Duxiu.

795
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
What's your heart about Ann?

796
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,440
Ah, brother

797
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,480
That's very kind of me.

798
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
Think about it. I have these materials.

799
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,440
Once it's in the newspaper

800
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
That's explosive news.

801
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,920
Then you won't miss it.

802
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,760
It's not up to me whether it's boarded or not.

803
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,280
Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei

804
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,560
Although I don't deal with them

805
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,400
But I know the weight.

806
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,360
It is the critical moment of the student movement.

807
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
Cai Yuanpei ran away

808
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Chen Duxiu is recognized as a young teacher.

809
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Some people even say

810
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,200
He said he was the commander behind the May 4th Movement.

811
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,480
At this critical moment

812
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
This key figure has caused such a big scandal.

813
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,160
This pair of student movements

814
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
Will be a devastating blow.

815
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,400
Do you know

816
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
I, as a

817
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,840
Editor-in-chief of a newspaper column under the leadership of a student union.

818
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,560
I can't watch students' sports collapse.

819
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Do you understand?

820
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,720
What should I do then?

821
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
You are his son.

822
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
It is your duty to stop your father.

823
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Don't do these things again at this time.

824
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,240
Stop smearing the student movement.

825
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,000
Newspapers smear every day.

826
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,840
But that's not evidence.

827
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,680
Who is the witness?

828
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,680
Let him confront me.

829
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,960
If what he said is true

830
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,480
I, Chen Yannian

831
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,720
Break up with Chen Duxiu now

832
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,400
We are north

833
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,760
Many of their professors at Peking University are witnesses.

834
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,360
Who are many professors?

835
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
If it is against the new culture of the hundred schools.

836
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,960
I don't think I can fully believe it.

837
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
Trekking

838
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
Then I'll tell you two

839
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,760
It's not retro

840
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,960
Shen Yinmo, the peer editor of New Youth

841
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,720
And an old friend of your father's.

842
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
Principal Tang Erhe

843
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,920
These two are from the same year.

844
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,360
Recommend your father's great benefactor

845
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,840
Not long ago, it was them.

846
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,520
Force mainly from your father.

847
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,120
Senior position in liberal arts

848
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,440
Yannian

849
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,680
I know how you feel right now.

850
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
Knowing that my father is such a person

851
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,720
I can understand how you feel now.

852
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,040
such

853
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,360
I'll put these things here

854
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,400
Take a look when you are free.

855
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,360
Yannian

856
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,000
Facts are facts.

857
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,000
Dare to face it?

858
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,920
Look at yourself.
