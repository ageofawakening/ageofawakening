[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
The May Fourth Movement was great.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,960
Here, I want to ask you a question.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,360
Why is the May Fourth Movement great?

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
Large scale, and large number of people.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Also all walks of life took part.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,600

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,600
But I think

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
the most important thing about the May Fourth Movement,

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,080
is that it is an anti-feudal

These few days,

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,720
I was buried in thoughts sitting in the ancestral temple of Hanyu.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,120
I realized something.

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,080
If China seeks development,

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,080
then the path of Russian Revolution should be adopted.

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
That is the inspiration of the May Fourth Movement.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,440
Everyone is here today.

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,000
Just in time, I propose,

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
let's restart the reading class in the Red Building here.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Let's study together and think thoroughly

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
which path can lead to a better China.

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,600
Sounds good?

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,800

33

between Marxism and anarchism

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,440
right here in Wufengshan?

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,960
Do you dare to take it?

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
Of course I will.

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,920
To the very end.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,400
Okay!

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
Speaking of which.

41

Mr. Hu Shi

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
published an article

43
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,080
in the latest "Weekly Review",

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,440
titled

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,160
"Focus more on actual problems, less on abstract doctrine."

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,760
It caused a wide response.

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,680
Lan Gongwu,

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
the one from the research department,

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
also published an article

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
in the "National Gazette".

51
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,560
It's called "Problems and Doctrine".

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,760
These two articles caused quite a controversy now.

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
Before I came here,

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,880
I visited Mr. Zhongfu.

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
He's a little ambiguous on this issue.

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,160
He doesn't agree with Mr. Hu Shi,

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
but he also doesn't think Lan Gongwu's words are convincing enough.

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
So he asked me to turn to Mr. Shouchang for some advice.

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,520
Please take a look at this article.

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Students.

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
I think it is too early for a debate

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
between Marxism

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
and anarchism.

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,200
I suggest

65
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
we should discuss this first.

66
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
This problem and doctrine from Mr. Hu Shi.

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
To Mr. Shizhi.

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,680
I have read your article

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,520
from the paper that came out on the 31st.

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,520
The title is

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,320
"Focus more on actual problems, less on abstract doctrine."

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
Inspired by which, I have some thoughts now.

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
Some

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
may relate to your view,

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,600
some is what I want to tell the whole society.

76
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
Now I write them all down.

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080

[Peking University]

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,840
Fellow students.

80
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
I asked you to stay at school.

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
Because there's something ongoing now that might affect you.

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,160
Everyone knows,

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,280
during the May Fourth movement,

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,720
Mr. Mu Ouchu from Shanghai

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,960
made a donation to Peking University,

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
a huge amount of money.

87
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,080
But the student union didn't take it.

88
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,360
Now, my senior alumnus, Mr. Jiang Menglin

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
entrusted by Mr. Cai,

90
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
manages Peking University.

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
So I asked him.

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
Can we use this money?

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
Can we use it

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
to support students with potential in Peking University

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
to study abroad in the United States?

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,920
Mr. Jiang agreed.

97
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
You here are all possible candidates.

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,160
So I kept you late today.

99
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,027
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

100
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,920
However, there is another reason

101
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,160
for having you all here today.

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,960
I believe that

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,240
you have all read my article

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,520
from the "Weekly Review" that came out on the 31st.

105
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,200
"Focus more on actual problems, less on abstract doctrine"

106
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Everyone here played vital role in the May Fourth Movement.

107
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,920
I want to talk to you about this article.

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,760
Since the May Fourth Movement,

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
many people

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,760
don't talk about specific political issues.

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,160
Instead, they only blabber about Marxism

112
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
and anarchism.

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
I can't watch it.

114
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,800
I can't stand it either.

115
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,760
Because I am a believer in experimentalism.

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,480
I felt provoked, so I want to talk about politics now.

117
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
Which resulted in that article.

118
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,520
I think there is a great danger now.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
That is the empty talk on imported doctrine,

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
and the clueless bias towards theory from foreign papers.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
Instead of actually investigating

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
on what China today really needs.

123
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,480
Students.

124
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
I have read the article

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
"Focus more on actual problems, less on abstract doctrine"

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,880
from Mr. Hu Shi.

127
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,000
I think there are several important issues

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
that I need to clarify with you.

129
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,800
So I wrote this article

130
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
with this title here.

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
Mr. Shouchang.

132
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Why is that called reconsideration?

133
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,280
Because Lan Gongwu has already published his article "Problems and Doctrine"

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
in the "National Gazette".

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
So my one

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,760
is the second consideration.

137
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
First of all,

138
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,200
I disagree with his view

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,520
that we should focus less on doctrine.

140
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
Given the current situation in China,

141
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,360
the most urgent matter for us

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
is to find a way to save the country.

143
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
Without doctrine and theory,

144
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
there is no direction.

145
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,680
Looking for a new road without a guide flag,

146
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
we may go down a wrong path or worse,

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
a dead end.

148
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
Therefore, doctrine

149
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
is crucial.

150
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,760
Sir.

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
I have read Mr. Hu Shi's article.

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
He said he deeply felt

153
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,800
the danger behind doctrine.

154
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,160
That danger Mr. Hu Shi talked about,

155
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm afraid it's not caused by doctrine.

156
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,160
What brought it then?

157
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,640
Those who only blabber about doctrine.

158
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I remember Mr. Zhongfu once said that

159
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
what China today desperately needs

160
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,920
is a theory that can save the nation.

161
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
So what is theory, students?

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Theory is doctrine.

163
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,480
If China wants to develop,

164
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,720
we must find an advanced theory,

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,240
a doctrine.

166
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,920
Mr. Hu Shi said that

167
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,560
there is fake socialism.

168
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
So we can't talk about it.

169
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
I don't agree with this either.

170
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
It is true that now

171
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
there are all kinds of socialism being spread around.

172
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
There is the scientific socialism

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,320
which we promote.

174
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
There is also Anfu Club's socialism,

175
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,200
also, all kinds of incorrect socialism.

176
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,880
It really tarnished the reputation of scientific socialism.

177
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
But for who wants to seek the truth,

178
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
for who wants to save the country,

179
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
how can you give up the pursuit of scientific truth

180
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,400
just because there are impostors?

181
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,200
Right?

182
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
We cannot stop pursuing the truth

183
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
just because the Anfu Club

184
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,000
are promoting their version of socialism.

185
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,680
The whole "less on doctrine" view of Mr. Hu Shi

186
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
is actually against solving China's current problems

187
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,680
fundamentally.

188
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
Moreover, it is treating those who seek fundamental solutions

189
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,920
as dangerous extremists.

190
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
He wants people to focus more on problems,

191
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
which is actually advocating improvement over full-scale change.

192
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,320
It's putting a plaster on an open wound instead of healing it completely.

193
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,600
It is wrong and won't work.

194
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,520
Everyone knows that under the dark rule of the Beiyang government,

195
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,840
China is a lifeless country.

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
A withered society.

197
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
They would go as far as to turn a school into a prison

198
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
to hold patriotic students.

199
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,000
In such a society,

200
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
what practical problems can you solve?

201
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,200
Use all and every tool you have, but there is still no way

202
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
to bring the hope back.

203
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm afraid at time like this,

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,920
we have to find a fundamental solution,

205
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,760
that's the only hope for the actual problems to be solved.

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,360
Sir.

207
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
I wonder if there is a successful case.

208
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,040
One that focused on doctrine before solving actual problems.

209
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,400
There is.

210
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Take Russia as an example.

211
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,600
The means of production shall be owned by the people.

212
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,400
This is the principle of socialism.

213
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,600
All those problems that could not be solved in the past,

214
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
are now solved.

215
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
According to Marxist historical materialism,

216
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
the foundation of human society is the economy.

217
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,480
Issues regarding law,

218
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,680
economics,

219
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,640
and the community,

220
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
and other abstractions,

221
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
these are all like the surface structures of a building.

222
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Underneath all these structures,

223
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,400
there is economics.

224
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
Economics is the foundation.

225
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,200
If the economic structure ever moves,

226
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,400
then all the above structures will shatter.

227
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
So in other words,

228
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
the economic problem is the fundamental problem.

229
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
So once the economic problem is solved,

230
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
then all the other issues

231
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
like politics, law, community,

232
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
women's liberation,

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,960
and issues regarding workers

234
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
can all be settled.

235
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,680
Sir, could you speak more slowly?

236
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
We can't catch up to you.

237
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
I noticed that your have so many new insights

238
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
in Marxism recently.

239
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm working on

240
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,840
the second part of "My View of Marxism".

241
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
That topic just now,

242
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,360
we will talk about it sometime.

243
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,280
But not today.

244
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Today I want to talk to you about Bolshevism.

245
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
I have declared publicly that

246
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,640
I am fond of Bolshevism very much.

247
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,320
The day when the Allies won,

248
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
I wrote an article.

249
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,520
It's called "The Victory of Bolshevism"

250
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
published in "New Youth".

251
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,120
Perhaps because some people in Japan

252
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
translated Bolshevism as radicalism,

253
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,520
some people say it is a kind of cruel doctrine.

254
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
That's absurd.

255
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,080
I have a strong feeling.

256
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
The popularity of Bolshevism

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
is a great turning point of human culture.

258
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
We should introduce it.

259
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
We should study it

260
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
and spread it to human society.

261
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,560
Just because there all some rumors about it,

262
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
doesn't mean we should just believe that and treat Bolshevism negatively.

263
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
Or even eliminate it.

264
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,760
Some time ago, some people said that

265
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,040
after the October Revolution

266
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,040
Kropotkin was shot.

267
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
But recently there are reports from the West say that

268
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
he is safe and sound somewhere near Moscow.

269
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,077
Exactly.

270
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,160
This incident helped us clarify

271
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
a question.

272
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,320
What is Bolshevism?

273
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
Those who advocate not talking about doctrine,

274
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
what they aim at is to be against Bolshevism,

275
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,240
against scentific principles.

276
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,880
With people like that around, what shall we do then?

277
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
Promoting an abstract doctrine and studying into the practical problems,

278
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,280
they are not contradictory, instead they help each other in many ways.

279
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,720
To solve a widely existing problem in society,

280
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,880
it has to rely on the common movement of most people in that society.

281
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,640
To have a common movement,

282
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
there must be a common doctrine as the criterion.

283
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
So it is necessary to talk about doctrine.

284
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Without it,

285
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
without the guidance of scientific theory,

286
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
there is no way to solve those social problems.

287
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,480
Let more people know about the scientific truth

288
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,640
and use this doctrine as a material,

289
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,080
as a tool,

290
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
to solve one practical problem after another.

291
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
As for all those nonsense,

292
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
those who only blabber,

293
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
let them be.

294
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,160
Radicalism?

295
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
Great disaster and danger?

296
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,360
Calling us heretics?

297
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
They can say whatever they want about us.

298
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,640
Because we don't care about them at all.

299
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,640
The methods for rescuing turned out to be impossible.

300
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,400
It has also led to many tragedies in history

301
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,560
that did not need to happen.

302
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
Which one is professor Hu Shi?

303
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,840
I am.

304
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,200
Director Wu asked for you

305
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,120
to please come to the Metropolitan Police Department with me.

306
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,240
What are you doing?

307
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,040
Yeah, what is it?

308
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
What do you want with Mr. Hu?

309
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
Don't worry, let me do the talking.

310
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,640
What time and what is it about?

311
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm just following my orders.

312
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,960
Please come now.

313
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
Car is waiting outside.

314
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
I don't know what it is about.

315
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
Please.

316
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,960
Sir.

317
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,040
Stay at school.

318
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,400
Wait for me.

319
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,000
Please.

320
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Jialun.

321
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,640
Sinian.

322
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
We need to report this, go.

323
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,640
Go.

324
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
Professor Hu, please sit down for a moment.

325
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Director Wu will be here soon.

326
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,800
Thank you.

327
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:49,374
[Wu Bingxiang, Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department]

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
Fellow townsman.

329
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
Young fellow.

330
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
Your reputation is now at its peak.

331
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,880
Seems like you will be able to replace Chen Duxiu soon.

332
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,040
Director Wu said we are brothers from the same town.

333
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
That's too much.

334
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,640
Why, is that not true?

335
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
True that we are from same place.

336
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
But I can't not even imagine being your brother.

337
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
After all, we are not the same kind.

338
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
Are you saying I am not a human just like you?

339
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,320
Director Wu, you misunderstood.

340
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,000
I mean,

341
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,160
we are not the same kind of people.

342
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,680
We are two people on two different paths.

343
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, since you don't care about talking about hometown.

344
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
Then let's get down to business.

345
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
I was just about to ask Director Wu.

346
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
You sent a car to bring me here.

347
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
What is the reason?

348
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,920
Please sit down.

349
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,360
Sit down.

350
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,680
Brother Hu.

351
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,200
The "Weekly Review",

352
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
I don't think it's necessary to continue.

353
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,880
What does this mean?

354
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,160
This is for your own good.

355
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,240
The "Weekly Review" promotes radical remarks.

356
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,160
Spreading rumors and disturbing the people.

357
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,360
A serious allegation.

358
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
I don't think the Director has the power

359
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
to stop the publication.

360
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,160
Like I said, it's for your own good.

361
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
Look at these.

362
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
These are all evidence material.

363
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,400
My boss has ordered the Police Department to file a case for investigation.

364
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
I made an exception

365
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,600
and invited you here to talk to you in peace,

366
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
given that we are from the same town.

367
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
Director Wu, what do you have in mind?

368
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,920
Two ways, you either stop publishing right now,

369
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,280
or you and others will face investigation and ban by the government.

370
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,720
I advise you to choose the easier one

371
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,560
or end it yourself.

372
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,600
The "Weekly Review"

373
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
is a registered publication of Peking University.

374
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,040
Chen Duxiu is the editor-in-chief.

375
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm just a temporary custodian.

376
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm afraid I can't make that decision.

377
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,720
I have to say sorry to your kindness, Director Wu.

378
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,920
Indeed.

379
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,840
It is precisely because Chen Duxiu is the one in charge of the "Weekly Review"

380
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
that I want to talk to you about the situation.

381
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,440
Think about it.

382
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,800
The attention on Chen Duxiu's case has just dropped a bit.

383
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,960
At this time, an investigation on "Weekly Review",

384
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,080
a new case on file,

385
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,400
it's not gonna help with his case.

386
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,680
Let alone if he can get out or not,

387
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,640
it will be if he can live or not.

388
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
Let me tell you this.

389
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,680
Your decision doesn't matter.

390
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,360
The government will ban it either way.

391
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,440
I say you might as well take the initiative,

392
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,440
give all concerned parties an easy way out.

393
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
Then, after some time,

394
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,960
when things are not this tense again,

395
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,520
you can always apply to run another new paper.

396
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,280
Director Wu, what you meant is that

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,960
if now,

398
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,720
I stop the "Weekly Review",

399
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,160
Zhongfu can come out soon?

400
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,400
Hard to be a good guy these days.

401
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
Why else would I have you invited here?

402
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,400
Have some tea.

403
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
Director Wu, I'll go back and talk to the others.

404
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,880
We will do as you say.

405
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
Now you see, we are indeed brothers from the same town.

406
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,160
Have some tea.

407
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:05,841
[Autumn 1919]

408
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,560
Work is labor.

409
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
Labor is work.

410
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
Focus on your work, everyone.

411
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,920
Yeah.

412
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,040
Mr. Shouchang.

413
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Mr. Shouchang, good news.

414
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,960
Just got the message.

415
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
"I am fully recovered and will be in Beijing soon."

416
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
"Back to school on the 20th."

417
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,240
From Cai Yuanpei.

418
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,160
Good, great!

419
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,640
Now the rescue movement for Mr. Cai has succeeded.

420
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
All that's left is brother Zhongfu.

421
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,080
Come on, students, work hard.

422
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,720
Come on!

423
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah!

424
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,120
Mr. Shouchang.

425
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,880
This is Zhou Enlai from the Tianjin Student Union.

426
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
They made a special trip to ask you for advice.

427
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,760
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shouchang.

428
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,040
Nice to see you, students.

429
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,800
Zhou Enlai.

430
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,200
I know you.

431
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,680
I read your "Innovation".

432
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,040
Very well written and insightful.

433
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,545
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiangyu, editor-in-chief of the "Tianjin Student Union Newspaper"]

434
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,400
Sir, I'm flattered.

435
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,214
Let's sit down and talk, okay?

436
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:24,880
Okay.

437
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,360
Please sit.

438
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,800
There are stools here.

439
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,680
Enlai.

440
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,920
What's the situation like over there?

441
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,600
You might not know.

442
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
The police forced us

443
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
to stop the "Tianjin Student Union Newspaper".

444
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
We're preparing for a reissue.

445
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,680
I heard about it.

446
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,040
Recently the reactionaries are acting aggressively.

447
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,800
The "Weekly Review" also had to stop.

448
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,560
But our "New Youth"

449
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,080
will be back again soon.

450
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,280
We came here with a question.

451
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
We want to know your advice on

452
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,120
how to make the patriotic student movement

453
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,320
a long-lasting movement.

454
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,960
Long-lasting.

455
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
Enlai, you brought this question to me

456
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,040
at the exact right time.

457
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,840
After the issue of the Paris Peace Conference has come to an end.

458
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,720
How to find new goals for the student movement?

459
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
What should we do now?

460
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,920
This is indeed a question worthy of consideration.

461
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
Do you have any ideas?

462
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,480
In Tianjin,

463
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,560
we have two main student associations

464
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
and women's associations.

465
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,560
Which leads to the potential problem

466
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
of unified command and coordination.

467
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,280
So we thought

468
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
can we unify these two organizations?

469
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,560
Among them, the backbone will make up the Awakening Society.

470
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
On top of leading the student movement,

471
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
we need to strengthen our minds with new knowledge and ideological forces.

472
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,760
We should study new thoughts, new ideas, publish publications,

473
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,160
and form a core team with the adequate knowledge and skills

474
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
that can take the responsiility as leader of the students.

475
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
I really don't know.

476
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,960
Sir, do you think our idea is feasible?

477
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,960
I think it's very good.

478
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
After what we been through during the May Fourth Movement,

479
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
now we are at this place,

480
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
at a critical moment needing a new guiding ideology.

481
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,320
At such a critical moment,

482
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,240
the Tianjin Student Union

483
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,440
chose to take a brave step to break the boundaries between men and women,

484
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
to organize the essential members

485
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,200
and start this Awakening Society.

486
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,360
Studying, researching and promoting new ideas and knowledge.

487
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
I really think

488
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,920
you are now holding

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,840
the core of the student movement.

490
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,440
I like the sound of it.

491
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
I support you all.

492
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,080
Good.

493
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
We are hoping that

494
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
you can come to Tianjin to give us a speech.

495
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
Share your valuable insights with us, give us the chance to learn.

496
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,040
Well, I'd like to go.

497
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,920
But we don't have any funds.

498
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,960
For transportation,

499
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,800
you will have to pay for it yourself, sir.

500
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
No problem, I will take care of that.

501
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
Please tell me if you have any difficulties.

502
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,960
I will do my best to help.

503
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,840
Thank you, sir.

504
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
You are welcome.

505
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
So in this speech,

506
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,840
what do you want me to talk about?

507
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,920
Whatever you want to, sir.

508
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,800
Right.

509
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
How about this?

510
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,480
Here.

511
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
It's my second half part of

512
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,800
"My View of Marxism",

513
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,240
it will come out on "New Youth",

514
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,040
next issue.

515
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
I will talk about this.

516
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,000
Marxism.

517
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,280
Excellent.

518
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,880
Perfect topic.

519
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Want some noodles with soybean paste?

520
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
Noodles with soybean paste.

521
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,640
Of course.

522
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,880
I need to go to a meeting soon.

523
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,600
Shiyan.

524
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
Take care of Enlai and the others for me.

525
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,920
Take them to have some noodles.

526
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,720
The usual place.

527
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,760
Longfu Temple.

528
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Big amount, enough for everone.

529
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,920
Thank you, sir.

530
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,840
Jingtan, you saw the bigger picture

531
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,440
on how to deal with this Chen Duxiu problem.

532
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,120
Take a seat.

533
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,200
Okay.

534
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,320
Come and sit.

535
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,440
Jingtan, now North and South is trying to reach an agreement.

536
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:59,009
[Xu Shichang, pen name Juren, President of the Republic of China]

537
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
The southern government insists to release Chen Duxiu.

538
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
To make sure this agreement goes through smoothly,

539
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,760
we might as well just let Chen Duxiu go.

540
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,800
Mr. President.

541
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,040
I have long anticipated this day.

542
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
I have already prepared for this day.

543
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
Don't worry, I'll do it right away.

544
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
No, no, no.

545
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,120
There is more.

546
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,920
Chen Duxiu is a dangerous person.

547
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,360
We are letting him go,

548
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,720
not setting him free to do whatever he wants.

549
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,720
Even out of the prison,

550
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,640
we need to supervise him.

551
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Otherwise, there will be chaos at any time.

552
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
Jingtan, you have experience.

553
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,080
You need to take more cautions in this respect.

554
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000
Rest assured, Mr. President.

555
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
I've already made a plan.

556
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,800
Talk to me.

557
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,280
First, the investigation on Chen Duxiu

558
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
has been going on over three months.

559
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,960
We have to give an explanation.

560
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,360
So, we will say it is a granted bail on the ground of sickness.

561
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,680
Hence, three sponsors are necessary for it.

562
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
They have to be a fellow villager too.

563
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
I volunteer to be one.

564
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,920
He shall find the other two by himself.

565
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,400
Second, after he's released,

566
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,800
there is also the probation period.

567
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
He has to report to the police station regularly.

568
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,760
He can't leave Beijing without permission.

569
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,080
If he agrees to these two articles,

570
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,680
we will let him go.

571
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,040
Right.

572
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
Jingtan, that's very thoughtful.

573
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,440
Do it your way.

574
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,240
Yes.

575
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Professor Chen Duxiu of Peking University.

576
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,240
He has been detained by the Metropolitan Police Department for more than three months.

577
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,680
Given that the investigation by the Police Department

578
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,600
has not shown any illegal actions carried out by Chen,

579
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,880
also, considering the three months of prison life

580
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
has caused him stomach illness,

581
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,120
he is now released on bail by fellow Anhui villagers.

582
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
During the time, his actions shall be restricted.

583
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,000
Any major actions must be approved by the government.

584
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,360
Chen Duxiu, you can go now.

585

Dad has no right to let it go.

589
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,080
Dad is a bad guy.

590
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Give Yingying back to us.

591
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,600
You silly children, you don't understand.

592
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,680
It's good for it to set it free.

593
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Why are you crying?

594
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,080
How can you know?

595
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
I don't care. I want Yingying.

596
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
Let big brother get you a new one.

597
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,760
How about another Yingying?

598
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,080
A new Yingying.

599
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I don't want a new one, I want my Yingying.

600
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,120
Yes. It's Yingying. It's Yingying.

A big meal right after I get off the train.

608
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,400
I say you have it all planned, coming at lunch time.

As long as we can win this fight,

I can even enjoy it.

What kind of hero is that?

632
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,920
Out of the prison and into the laboratory.

633
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,560
Or go to jail when you leave the laboratory.

I have been away from Peking University for four months.

you still hold the same spirit,

656
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,400
you still have the same ambition.

657
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,640
I feel gratified.

658
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,960
I want to say something.

659
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,640
The first sentence is,

660
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,400
we would like to thank Mr. Zhongfu.

661
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,760
It was brother Zhongfu here

662
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
who lit the torch of science and democracy for us.

663
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
Though I'm afraid that

664
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,560
the significance of this torch

665
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
will not be known until decades later.

666
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
It shows us the direction.

667
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,640
It also illuminates the way forward.

668
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,000
The second sentence is,

669
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,800
brother Zhongfu, I, Cai Yuanpei, apologize to you.

670
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,720

00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,840
I am saying this from my heart.

Master Cai, I really thank you.

673
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,480
You gave me a stage.

674
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,560
Have a seat.

675
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,760
Now we will demonstrate our poems.

676
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,520
During Mr. Zhongfu's imprisonment,

677
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,080
we all wrote something

678
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,360
reminding ourselves of Chen Duxiu.

679
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,080
Now Mr. Shizhi

680
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,200
will read his one out.

681
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,680
At this time, I want to borrow the tune of "Shengchazi"

682
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,440
and recite this little poem of mine

683
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,680
to share it with all my friends here,

684
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
and also dedicate this little poem to my beloved friend,

685
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,160
Mr. Zhongfu.

686
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,280
I'd rather not to miss you.

687
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,240
So I can avoid the lovesickness.

688
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:56,320
Think about it several times.

689
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:10,720
Now I am willing to be lovesick.

690
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,000
Excellent!

691
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,920
Now it's Mr. Liu Bannong's turn.

692
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,560
The title of Mr. Wang's poem is of very new style.

693
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,360
It's called "D!".

694
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,400
Zhongfu regained his freedom.

695
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,680
I am very excited.

696
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,280
I am going abroad soon.

697
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,720
Before I leave,

698
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,680
finally, I see him again.

699
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,840
I wrote a vernacular poem.

700
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,680
I'll just read a short paragraph.

701
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,960
I haven't seen you for more than eighty days.

702
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,160
People say it's separation.

703
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,560
It's a tragic parting.

704
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,640
Is that so?

705
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
Our friendship,

706
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
if it were not for those foolish people,

707
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,800
then whatever happens,

708
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,720
you still see me every day as usual

709
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,440
and I still see you every day.

710
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,480
The powers has imprisoned you,

711
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,720
yet I'm not confined.

712
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Countless comrades are not confined.

713
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,560
And countless brothers coming after us are not confined.

714
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,680
Bannong, you are a great talent.

715
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,240
It's my luck that I met you.

716
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,240
Great poem.

717
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,120
I heard Mr Shouchang stayed up all night last night.

718
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,640
He wrote a long poem.

719
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,880
Let's hear it together.

720
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,000
From Mr. Shouchang.

721
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,640
Brother Zhongfu and I all had a hard time.

722
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
It's like a rebirth of a phoenix for us.

723
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,240
My poem is a bit long,

724
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
but I sincerely hope that you

725
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,240
allow me to finish reading it

726
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,400
to show my admiration for brother Zhongfu.

727
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,080
Is that okay?

728
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,960
You got out of prison today.

729
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,040
We are all in great joy.

730
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
Their power, their authoritarianism

731
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
all defeated in front of absolute truth.

732
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,960
Prison? Death?

733
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,960
They can't bend your knees.

734
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,360
You support the truth.

735
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
So the truth supports you.

736
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,440
You got out of prison today.

737
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,480
We are all in great joy.

738
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,040
There are many good young people

It's either jail or laboratory.

741
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,640
It's either study or fight.

742
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
They all go to prison.

743
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,560
Then the prison becomes a laboratory.

744
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,040
You can relax there.

745
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,280
As you will never be alone, you will never be short of companions.

746
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,480
When shall we start this welcome meal.

747
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,160
I'm drooling.

748
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,400
Sorry. Sorry.

749
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
Sorry for keep you waiting.

750
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Let's eat now!

751
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,320
Here it is!

752
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,360
Yucai.

753
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,240
Always pushing the others.

754
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
When is your turn?

755
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,120
Me?

756
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,880
What do you mean?

757
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,640
I've been waiting for novel feast from you.

758
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,760
You don't know.

759
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
In prison,

760
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,320
I spent my time reading your novels.

761
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,000
The New Culture Movement can't do without it.

762
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,360
You see?

763
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,720
I have his food in my bowl, now I am in debt to him.

764
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,240
Zhongfu has gained the ability to push people for drafts

765
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,840
in these past days that I have never seen before.

766
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
Everyone.

767
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
I have something to say.

768
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,000
I was a child four years ago.

769
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
At a dinner party for Mr. Chen Duxiu

770
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,560
held by Mr. Wang Mengzou,

771
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
I changed an ox hoof dish

772
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,840
to a lazy frog.

773
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
I wanted to play a joke on my father.

774
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,600
But today

775
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,600
I made an ox hoof dish by myself.

776
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
I don't know if it's delicious.

777
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,720
But I want to dedicate it to my father.

778
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,720
Dedicated to this return to the laboratory from prison.

779
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
Mr. Chen Duxiu.

780
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,280
Please accept this gift.

781
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,280
For it also represents my apology.

782
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,120
Even if there is frog

783
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,720
in this plate today.

784
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,760
I'll still have it.

785
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,840
Everyone.

786
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,760
Never be satisfied.

787
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,600
Always learn something new.

788
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,200
Always making progress.

789
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,240
Chen Duxiu today

790
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,080
is still the same Chen Duxiu.

791
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,720
Chen Duxiu today

792
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
is also a brand-new Chen Duxiu.

793
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,000
Comrades.

794
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,590
[Tianjin Student Union Office, Caochangan, Tianjin]

795
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
Today, from Tianjin Student Union

796
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,960
and the women's patriotic comrades' association,

797
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,560
ten men and ten women each,

798
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,640
gathered here today.

799
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
For we share the same goal and the same mindset,

800
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,640
we set up this Awakening Society today.

801
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,480
This society

802
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,080
will be the leading organization of Tianjin students' patriotic movement.

803
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,680
With the spirit of introspection, pratical exercise,

804
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,360
persistence, dedication, joyfulness,

805
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,280
sacrifice and creation.

806
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
With the spirit of criticism and mutual assistance

807
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,080
We aim to build a new ideology foundation for students,

808
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
lead everyone to self-consciousness and self-determination.

809
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,560
Our determination

810
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
is to make concerted efforts to walk on the path of enlightenment.

811
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,280
At the same time, we hope to see all people

812
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
can find the path of enlightenment.

813
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,280
Comrades,

814
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,720
given the current potential danger of this career,

815
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,560
all names of members in the club

816
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
will remain hidden from the public.

817
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,360
So, we will draw from the pool

818
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
to give each one a number

819
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,560
as a code for communication,

820
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,840
and as the pseudonym.

821
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,280
There are fifty notes on the table now.

822
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,280
A number is written on each note.

823
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,800
The number you draw

824
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,200
is your future correspondence code and pen name.

825
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
Let's start drawing lots now.
