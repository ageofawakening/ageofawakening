[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,987
[Episode Thirty-seven]

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,880
classmates

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
We are all witnesses of the May 4th Movement.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
The May 4th Movement was great.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,960
Then I want to ask my classmates about the price.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,360
What is the greatness of the May 4th Movement?

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
Large scale and large number of people

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Then all walks of life took part.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,600
Qun was right first.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,600
But I thought

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
The most important point of the May 4th Movement

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,080
Is that it is a war against feudalism.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,920
And against imperialism.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
Mass patriotic self-help movement

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,440
In recent days

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,720
I reflected on the inside of Hanwengong Temple.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,120
I realized a truth.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,080
If China wants to develop

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm afraid I have to take the road of Russian revolution. 

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
This is the inspiration of the May 4th Movement. 

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,440
Everyone is here today.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,000
I just propose

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
Let's restore the reading class in the Red Chamber.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Let's study it carefully.

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
Which road should China take in the future?

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,600
is it all right

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,800
nicely

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,800
延年兄

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,480
Why don't we just sit on this Wufeng Mountain? 

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,440
Come to a vigorous Marxism

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,440
A big debate with anarchism

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,960
Do you dare to take it?

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
There's nothing to be afraid of.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,920
take sb. on right to very end

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,400
good

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
You talk about controversy.

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,360
Mr. Hu Shi

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
In the recent Weekly Review

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,080
Published an article.

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,440
The name is.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,160
Study more problems and talk less about socialism

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,760
It caused quite a response.

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,680
Gongwu

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
Lan Gong of the research department

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
Also in the National Gazette.

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
Published an article.

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,560
It's called "Problems and Doctrine"

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,760
His article with Hu Shi caused controversy.

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
Before I came here

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,880
I visited Mr. Zhongfu.

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
He's a little ambiguous. 

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,160
I don't seem to agree with Mr. Hu Shi. 

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
I also don't think Lan Gongwu is convincing.

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
So you want me to invite Mr. Shouchang

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,520
Take a look at this article

57
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,800
classmates

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
I think we should carry out Marxism now.

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
On anarchism.

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
It's a little early.

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,200
I suggest

62
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
Let's discuss it first.

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
Mr. Hu Shi question and doctrine

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
史鸷先生

65
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,680


66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,520
The paper published on the 31st. 

67
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,520
The title is

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,320
Study more problems and talk less about socialism

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
Some feelings happened.

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
Some of them.

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
Or can be invented with Mr. Wang's ideas.

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,600


73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
Now write them out one by one.

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
Please correct me, sir

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,840
Fellow students

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
Leave you at school.

77
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
Because there's something brewing.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,160
Everyone knows

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,280
May 4th period

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,720
Mr. Mu Ouchu of Shanghai

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,960
Donate to our Peking University.

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
Hundreds of thousands of oceans

83
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,080
But the student union didn't ask for it.

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,360
And now my senior brother, Mr. Jiang Menglin

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
Entrusted by Mr. Cai

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
Escrow Peking University

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
I asked him.

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
Can I use this money?

89
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
Can I use this sum of money?

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
To support potential students left in Peking University.

91
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
Go to America for further study. 

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,920
Mr. Jiang agreed.

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
You are all the subjects of investigation.

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,160
So I left you in the school.

95
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,920
Actually, I'll call everyone here today.

96
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,160
There is another thing to talk about.

97
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,960
You've seen it.

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm in the Weekly Review

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,520
It was written on the 31st.

100
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,200
Study more problems and talk less about socialism

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Everyone is the May Fourth Movement.

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,920
So I want to talk to you about this article.

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,760
Since the May 4th Movement

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
Many new molecules.

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,760
Shut up about specific political issues.

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,160
Instead, talk about Marxism.

107
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
And anarchism.

108
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
I can't watch it.

109
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,800
I can't stand it either.

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,760
Because I am a believer in experimentalism.

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,480
So I got angry and wanted to talk about politics.

112
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
So there is this article.

113
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,520
I think there is a great danger now.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
That is the doctrine of empty talk about foreign imports.

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
Theory biased towards foreign paper

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
Instead of actually investigating.

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
What does he need in China today? 

118
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,480
classmates

119
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
I read Mr Hu Shi's article.

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
Study more problems and talk less about socialism

121
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,880
The article.

122
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,000
I think there are several important issues.

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
I need to clarify with you.

124
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,800
So I made this article.

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
Take this topic.

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
寿昌先生

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Why is that called reconsideration?

128
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,280
Because Lan Gongwu is in the National Gazette. 

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
Published the article "Problems and Doctrine" 

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
So this one of mine

131
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,760
It can only be called Sao theory.

132
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
First of all, a little

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,200
I disagree, Mr. Hu Shi 

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,520
The viewpoint of less talk.

135
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
Because of the current medium voltage

136
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:56,880


137
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,360
What we need to do as a matter of urgency.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
Is to find a way to save the country 

139
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
Absolutism and scientific theory

140
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
There is no direction.

141
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,680
Looking for a new road without a guide flag.

142
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
You may go down a wrong path. 

143
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
Even a dead end.

144
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
Therefore, doctrine

145
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
Is always important.

146
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,760
sir

147
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
I have read Mr Hu Shi's article.

148
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
He said he felt it deeply.

149
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,800
The danger of socialism

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,160
Mr. Hu Shi talked about the danger of socialism.

151
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm afraid it's not socialism itself.

152
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,160
What brought it?

153
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,640
Who are those who talk about it?

154
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I remember Mr. Zhongfu once said a word

155
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
Talking about China today

156
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,920
What is needed most is the theory of saving the nation. 

157
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
So what's the theory, students?

158
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Theory is doctrine.

159
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,480
So if China wants to develop

160
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,720
We must find an advanced theory.

161
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,240
Is doctrine.

162
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,920
Mr. Hu Shi

163
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,560
Socialism is fake.

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
So we can't talk about it.

165
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
I don't agree with this either.

166
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
It is true that today's society

167
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
There are all kinds of socialism in vogue.

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
There is something we promote.

169
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,320
scientific socialism

170
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
An-Fu's Socialism

171
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,200
All kinds of fake socialism

172
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,880
It really tarnished the reputation of scientific socialism.

173
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
But for us to seek the truth

174
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
For those who seek to save the country.

175
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
How can you give up just because there is an impostor? 

176
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,400
What about the pursuit of scientific truth?

177
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,200
right

178
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
We can't let the Anfu family

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
They also talk about socialism. 

180
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,000
Stop pursuing the truth. 

181
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,680
Mr. Hu Shi advocated less talk about socialism and more solutions to problems. 

182
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Actually, it's against it. Fundamentally

183
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,680
Solve China's problems

184
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
And this fundamental solution

185
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,920
As dangerous extremism. 

186
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360


187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
Is essentially advocating improvement.

188
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,320
Do not touch the reactionary foundation.

189
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,600
This is wrong and won't work.

190
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,520
Everyone knows that under the dark rule of Beiyang government 

191
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,840
China is a lifeless country.

192
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
Withered society

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
How dare he turn the school into a prison?

194
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
Used to hold patriotic students.

195
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,000
In such a society

196
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
What practical problems can you solve?

197
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,200
When you use any tool, there is no way to make it 

198
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
At the time of resurrection

199
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm afraid we must

200
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,920
There is a fundamental solution.

201
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,760
There is hope that all the specific problems will be solved.

202
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,360
sir

203
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
I wonder if there is a successful case.

204
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,040
It is to talk about socialism before solving practical problems. 

205
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,400
yes

206
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
As far as Russia is concerned

207
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,600
The means of production shall be owned by all the people. 

208
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,400
This is the principle of socialism.

209
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,600
Problems that could not be solved by any society in the past. 

210
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
Now it's all solved.

211
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
According to Marxist historical materialism

212
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
The foundation of human society is economy.

213
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,480
legal question

214
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,680
economic problem

215
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,640
Family problems

216
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
Wait, mental structure

217
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
All belong to the surface structure of superstructure.

218
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Then the lower side of these superstructures

219
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,400
There is an economic structure. 

220
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
Economic structure is their foundation.

221
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,200
Once the economic structure changes

222
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,400
The above structure will also change.

223
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
So in other words

224
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,560


225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
The economic problem is the fundamental problem.

226
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
So once the economic problems are solved

227
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
What political issues, legal issues?

228
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
Family system problem

229
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
Women's liberation

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,960
Worker problem

231
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
It's all settled.

232
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,680
Sir, could you speak more slowly?

233
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
We can't remember it a bit.

234
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
I find that you are interested in Marxism recently.

235
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
There are many new ideas. 

236
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm writing

237
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,840
The second part of My View of Marxism

238
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
That topic just now

239
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,360
Let's talk in detail sometime.

240
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,280
But I don't want to talk about it today.

241
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,240
I want to talk to you about Bolshevism.

242
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
I declare publicly that

243
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,640
I like Bolshevism very much.

244
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,320
Remember the day when the Allies won.

245
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
I made an article.

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,520
It's called "The Victory of Bolshevism"

247
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
On the "new youth"

248
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,120
Maybe it's because someone in Japan put Bolshevism

249
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
Translate into the source of radicalism

250
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,520
Some people say it is a kind of cruel doctrine. 

251
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680


252
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,080
I have a strong feeling.

253
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
The popularity of Bolshevism

254
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
Is a great change in our human culture.

255
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
We should introduce it.

256
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
We should study it.

257
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
And spread it to human society.

258
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,560
Don't listen to other people's rumors about it

259
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
Treat it with cruel and rude words.

260
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
Wipe it all out.

261
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,760
Some time ago, someone said

262
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,040
After the October Revolution

263
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,040
Krupotkin was shot.

264
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
But recent European and American reports say

265
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
He is safe and sound near Moscow.

266
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,160
This makes us see more clearly.

267
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
A question.

268
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,320
What is Bolshevism?

269
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
Those who advocate not talking about socialism

270
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
Since it is against Bolshevism.

271
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,240
What is opposed is the truth of science.

272
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,880
In this case, how can we

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
We believe that the doctrine of claiming ideals

274
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,280
It is complementary to studying practical problems.

275
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,720
The solution of social problems

276
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,880
We must rely on the common movement of most people in society.

277
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,640
But to have a common movement. 

278
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
There must be a common doctrine as the criterion.

279
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
So it is necessary to talk about socialism. 

280
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Nonpropagandism

281
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
Without the guidance of scientific theory

282
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
Social problems will never be solved.

283
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,480
Let more people know the scientific truth

284
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,640
And use this doctrine as a material.

285
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,080
As a tool

286
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
To solve one practical problem after another.

287
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
As for those cats and dogs

288
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Parrot phonograph

289
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
Let them ring around.

290
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,160
What radicalism?

291
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
fierce floods and savage beasts—great scourge and great disaster

292
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,360
heresy

293
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
We let them label us randomly.

294
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,640
Because we don't care about them at all. 

295
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,640
The method of relief became impossible.

296
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,400
It also made history play out.

297
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,560
A lot of unnecessary misery.

298
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
Who is professor Hu Shi?

299
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,840
speaking

300
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,200
Our director Wu

301
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,120
Please go to the Metropolitan Police Department.

302
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,240
What are you doing?

303
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,040
Yeah, what are you doing? 

304
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
What do you want with Mr. Hu?

305
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
Don't worry, I'll ask him.

306
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,640
When and what?

307
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm also ordered to ask you

308
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,960
Go now.

309
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
The car is waiting in front of the door

310
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
I don't know what it is.

311
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
Please

312
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,960
sir

313
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,040
Stay at school.

314
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,400
Wait for me.

315
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,000
please

316
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Jialun

317
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,640
Sinian

318
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
Report to school. Go

319
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,640
Go for a walk

320
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
Professor Hu, please sit down for a moment.

321
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Director Wu will be here soon.

322
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,800
thank you

323
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
fellow townsman

324
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
young fellow

325
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
Your fame is in full swing now.

326
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,880
There is a great potential to replace Chen Duxiu.

327
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,040
Director Wu called me bro fellow villager.

328
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
I don't deserve it.

329
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,640
Why don't I deserve to be your buddy?

330
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
It's not that you don't deserve it

331
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
But I Hu Shi dare not climb the ladder.

332
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
After all, I'm not the same kind.

333
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
What do you mean, calling me a human being?

334
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,320
Director Wu, you misunderstood.

335
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,000
I mean

336
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,160
We are not the same kind of people.

337
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,680
It's two people on the road.

338
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, since you don't care about your hometown

339
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
Then let's get down to business.

340
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
I'm just going to ask Director Wu. 

341
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
You invited me here with all your might.

342
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
What is the reason?

343
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,920
Please sit down.

344
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,360
Sit down.

345
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,680
Brother Hu

346
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,200
This weekly review, this publication

347
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
I don't think it's necessary to continue.

348
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,880
What does this mean?

349
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,160
This is for your own good.

350
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,240


351
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,240
The Weekly Review promotes radical remarks.

352
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,160


353
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,360
No small crime.

354
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
I think Director Hao didn't cancel my waiting.

355
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
The power to create primers.

356
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,160
I just said I was doing it for your own good.

357
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
Look at this again.

358
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
These are all evidence materials.

359
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,400
Shangfeng ordered the Police Department to file a case for investigation.

360
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
I remember that you are a fellow villager.

361
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,600
That's why I made an exception.

362
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
I invited you here to discuss with you.

363
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
Director Wu, what do you think?

364
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,920
One of the two roads is self-stopping.

365
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,280
Investigating and banning by the government

366
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,720
I advise you to choose the lesser of two evils.

367
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,560
Let's just end it ourselves.

368
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,600
Weekly review

369
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
It is a registered publication in Peking University. 

370
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,040
Chen Duxiu, he is the editor-in-chief.

371
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm just a temporary custodian. 

372
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm afraid I can't make decisions.

373
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,720
I failed to live up to your kindness, Director Wu. 

374
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,920
precisely because

375
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,840
The editor-in-chief of Weekly Review is Chen Duxiu. 

376
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
I just asked you to stop it.

377
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,440
You can think it over.

378
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,800
Chen Duxiu's case has just been loosened.

379
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,960
At this time to the Weekly Review

380
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,080
report of placing a case on file 

381
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,400
Duxiu is afraid not.

382
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,680
The problem of getting out and not getting out. 

383
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,640
It's a question of living or not.

384
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
Let me tell you this.

385
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,680
Do you agree or disagree?

386
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,360
The government will ban it.

387
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,440
I advise you to take the initiative.

388
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,440
Everyone has a step down.

389
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
Maybe by some time.

390
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,960
I won't pursue it.

391
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,520
If you want to run a newspaper, you can apply again. 

392
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,280
Director Wu, what do you mean?

393
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,960
If now

394
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,720
The Weekly Review was closed for it.

395
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,160
Can Zhongfu come out soon?

396
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,400
Good people are hard to do.

397
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
Otherwise, why did I call you here? 

398
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,400
Drink tea.

399
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
Director Wu, I'll go back and discuss with you.

400
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,880
According to director Wu's strength.

401
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
It has to be a fellow villager to help fellow villagers.

402
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,160
Drink tea.

403
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,560
Work is labor.

404
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
Labor is work.

405
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
Let's all work carefully.

406
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,920
nicely

407
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,040
寿昌先生

408
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Mr. Shouchang, good news

409
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,960
A telegram just arrived.

410
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
My body has recently arrived in Beijing.

411
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
Be reinstated at school on the 20th. 

412
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,240
Cai Yuanpei

413
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,160
Okay, okay, okay.

414
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,640
Cai Wan's movement was a complete victory.

415
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
All that's left is brother Zhongfu.

416
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,080
Come on, students, work hard.

417
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,480
come

418
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:52,720


419
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,200
good

420
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,120
寿昌先生

421
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,880
This is Zhou Enlai from Tianjin Federation of Students. 

422
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
They made a special trip to ask you for advice.

423
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,760
寿昌先生好

424
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,040
Hello, classmates.

425
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,800
Zhou Enlai

426
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,200
I know you.

427
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,680
I read your "Innovation"

428
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,040
Very well written and insightful.

429
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,400
Sir, I'm flattered.

430
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
good

431
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,360
sit

432
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,800
There are stools here.

433
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,680
Enlai

434
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,920
What's the situation like over there?

435
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,600
I wonder if sir knows.

436
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
The police have put our

437
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
Tianjin Students' Union Newspaper was closed.

438
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
We're preparing for a reissue.

439
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,680
I heard about it.

440
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,040
Now the reactionaries are crazy.

441
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,800
The Weekly Review was also blocked.

442
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,560
But our New Youth

443
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,080
It will be published again soon. 

444
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,280
Let's come this time.

445
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
I mainly want to ask my husband for advice

446
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,120
How to put the patriotic student movement 

447
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,320
Persistent problem

448
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,960
Persistence

449
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
Well, I think your question

450
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,040
That's very good.

451
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,840
After the Paris peace conference

452
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,720
How to deepen the student movement?

453
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
What should we do again?

454
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,920
This is indeed a question worthy of consideration.

455
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
Do you have any ideas?

456
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,480
We Tianjin

457
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,560
There are major student associations and women's associations.

458
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
Two organizations

459
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,560
Exists objectively

460
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
The problem of unified command and coordination

461
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,280
So we thought

462
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
Can we unify the two organizations?

463
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,560
Among them, the backbone makes up the Awakening Society. 

464
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
In addition to leading the student movement

465
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
What's more important is to strengthen our own ideological armed forces.

466
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,760
Research new thoughts and ideas, publish publications.

467
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,160
Form an armed with new ideas.

468
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
A core group that can take on leadership responsibilities.

469
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
be ignorant of 

470
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,960
Sir, do you think our idea is feasible?

471
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,960
I feel particularly good.

472
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
After the baptism of the May 4th Movement

473
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
Now we are really at a place.

474
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
A critical moment for new guiding ideology.

475
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,320
At such a critical moment 

476
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,240
Your Tianjin Federation of Students

477
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,440
Dare to break the boundaries between boys and girls. 

478
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
Organize these backbones.

479
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,200
Set up an enlightenment club.

480
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,360
And publicize and research new ideas.

481
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
I really think

482
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,920
You caught it.

483
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,840
The core of the student movement.

484
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,440
I like you

485
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
I also support you.

486
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,080
good

487
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
We want Mr. Li

488
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
You go to Tianjin to give us a speech.

489
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
Let us also edify ourselves.

490
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,040
Well, I'd like to go

491
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,920
But we don't have any funds

492
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,960
If Lu Fei says so.

493
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,800
Sir, you need to come out yourself.

494
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
Okay, I'll bring my own dry food.

495
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
Please tell me if you have any difficulties.

496
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,960
Let me help you find a solution.

497
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,840
Thank you, sir.

498
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
You are welcome

499
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
So this speech

500
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,840
What do you want me to say?

501
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,920
We all like to hear what you say, sir. 

502
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,800
right

503
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
Do you think this will work?

504
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,480
What about this?

505
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
Will I be in the "new youth"

506
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,800
Published in the next issue

507
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,240
My View of Marxism

508
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,040
Lower part

509
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
That's what I'm talking about.

510
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,000
Marxism

511
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,280
Great

512
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,880
This question is too good.

513
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Do you eat in Zhajiang Noodles?

514
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
Noodles with soybean paste

515
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,640
Eat ah

516
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,880
I won't accompany you at a meeting later.

517
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,600
Shiyan

518
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
Take care of Enlai and my classmates for me.

519
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,760
Take them to eat Zhajiang Noodles.

520
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:25,920
Take them to Zhajiang Noodles.

521
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,720
the same place

522
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,760
Longsi

523
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Sufficient and sufficient.

524
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,920
Thank you, sir.

525
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,840
Tanna is dealing with Chen Duxiu's problem.

526
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,440
You're looking ahead and taking care of the big picture. 

527
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,120
sit

528
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,200
good

529
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,320
Come and sit.

530
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,440
Jingtan is going to make peace between North and South now. 

531
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
The southern government insisted on the release of Chen Duxiu. 

532
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
In order not to stimulate them

533
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,760
Let's find a step and let Chen Duxiu go.

534
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,800
president

535
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,040
I have long anticipated this day. 

536
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
That's why I left behind a successful man.

537
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
Don't worry, I'll do it right away.

538
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
No, no, no

539
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,120
Let me talk to you a few more words. 

540
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,920
Yes, Chen Duxiu is a dangerous man.

541
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,360
Play it when you play it.

542
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,720
But you can't let it go.

543
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,720
Is out of prison.

544
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,640
It is also necessary to be able to supervise

545
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Otherwise, there will be chaos at any time.

546
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
Jingtan, you have experience.

547
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,080
You need to do more in this respect. 

548
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000
Please rest assured the president.

549
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
I've already left a plan.

550
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,800
Tell us your opinion 

551
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,280
First, Chen Duxiu filed a case to investigate incense 

552
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
It's been over three months.

553
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,960
You have to have an explanation.

554
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,360
Therefore, it can only be said that it is released on bail due to illness. 

555
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,680
There must be three sponsors for this one.

556
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
You have to be a fellow villager.

557
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
I volunteered to count one.

558
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,920
Let him find the other two by himself.

559
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,400
Second, after he got out of prison 

560
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,800
Must continue to accept supervision.

561
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
Report his movements to the police station regularly. 

562
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,760
You can't leave Beijing without permission.

563
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,080
If he agrees to these two articles 

564
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,680
Then let's let him go. 

565
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,040
right

566
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
Mirror, it's thoughtful.

567
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,440
Just like you said.

568
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,240
be

569
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Professor Chen Duxiu of Peking University

570
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,240
He has been detained by the Metropolitan Police Department for more than three months.

571
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,680
Investigation results of the near police department

572
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,600
Eventually, Chen did not commit any illegal acts. 

573
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,880
Chen has lost his freedom in the hall for a long time.

574
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Then cause stomach trouble.

575
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,120
He was released on bail by fellow Anhui residents.

576
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
After bail, movement is still restricted.

577
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,000
Major actions must be approved by the government.

578
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,360
Chen Duxiu was released on bail.

579
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
It's our pigeon.

580
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,240
Dad has no right to let it go.

581
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,080
Dad is a bad guy.

582
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Give it back to Ying Ying.

583
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,600
You two silly children don't understand.

584
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,680
It's really good for it to be free. 

585
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Why are you crying?

586
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,080
How does dad know?

587
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
I don't care. I want Ying Ying.

588
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
Brother, here you are.

589
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,760
How about choosing another Ying Ying?

590
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,080
Choose Ying Ying.

591
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I don't want my Ying Ying.

592
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,120
Ying Ying is Ying Ying.

593
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,880
What smells so good?

594
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,240
Yes, sir.

595
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
covered tureen

596
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Hello, everybody!

597
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,080
Do you think I have the luck to eat sth delicious?

598
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,080
I have a big meal as soon as I get off the train.

599
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,400
You have a plan to step on it.

600
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
I don't eat yours for nothing.

601
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,080
come

602
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,280
So polite.

603
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,560
You brought something all the way here.

604
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
Please take a seat.

605
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,720
good

606
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,720
Zhongfu, let me see.

607
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,320
It's okay. Come sit down and talk

608
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,800
good

609
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,320
Zhongfu

610
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,040
Zhongfu

611
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,280
I understand that you have suffered a lot.

612
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,000
As long as we can win the struggle.

613
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,280
No matter how bitter.

614
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,040
I'm as happy as stuffing

615
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,960
Good point!

616
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
We welcome the hero back.

617
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
I'm flattered.

618
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,320
Is nothing more than the birthplace of world civilization.

619
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,920
Stay for a while.

620
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
What kind of hero is there?

621
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,920
Out of the prison into the laboratory.

622
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,560
Go to jail when you leave the lab.

623
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,360
This is the noblest life.

624
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,120
The most beautiful life

625
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Civilization from these two places.

626
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,040
Is the true civilization.

627
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,480
Is a civilization with life and value.

628
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,360
Sir, sit down.

629
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,520
Mr Cai, please sit down.

630
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,640
Come and sit down.

631
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,360
have a seat

632
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,040
have a seat

633
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,000
Sit down, sir.

634
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,760
thank you

635
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,200
ladies

636
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,080
gentlemen

637
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,520
Hello, everybody!

638
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,400
Welcome to Mr. Chen Duxiu's glorious release from prison

639
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,960
The welcome banquet begins now. 

640
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,240
First of all, please our

641
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,680
Mr Cai Yuanpei spoke.

642
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,400
I have been away from Peking University for four months.

643
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,240
See you today.

644
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
The initial heart depends on

645
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,400
The initial ambition has not been extinguished.

646
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,640
Feel gratified

647
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,960
I'll say a few words now.

648
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,640
The first sentence is

649
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,400
We would like to thank Mr. Zhongfu.

650
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,760
Brother Zhongfu gave me the price.

651
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
Lit the torch of science and democracy

652
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
The significance of this torch

653
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,560
I'm afraid it will be decades later.

654
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
To show it.

655
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
It shows us the direction.

656
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,640
It also illuminates the way forward.

657
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,000
The second sentence is 

658
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Brother Zhongfu, I'm Cai Yuanpei. I'm sorry.

659
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,720
sir

660
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,840
This is what I say from my heart.

661
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,440
Master Cai, I really thank you.

662
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,480
You gave me a stage.

663
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,560
have a seat

664
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,760
The following program is offering poems.

665
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,520
During Mr. Zhongfu's imprisonment

666
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,080
Many gentlemen have written it.

667
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,360
Miss his vernacular poems.

668
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,080
First of all, let's invite Mr. Shizhi

669
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,200
Present his little poem.

670
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,680
At this time, I want to use the Qupai of Shengchazi.

671
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,440
Recite a little poem of mine.

672
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,680
Share it with all your friends here. 

673
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
Also dedicate this little poem to my beloved friend. 

674
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,160
中富兄

675
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,280
I don't want to miss you either.

676
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,240
Can avoid lovesickness.

677
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:56,320
Think about it several times

678
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:10,720
Willing to be lovesick.

679
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,000
excellent

680
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,920
Let's ask Mr. Liu Bannong to present a poem.

681
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,560
The title of Mr. Wang's poem is The Renaissance.

682
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,360
It's called "D! 》 

683
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,400
中富出狱

684
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,680
I am very excited

685
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,280
I am going abroad soon.

686
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,720
Before I finally went abroad

687
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,680
I saw him again.

688
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,840
I wrote a vernacular poem.

689
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,680
I'll just read a short paragraph.

690
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,960
I haven't seen you for more than eighty days.

691
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,160
People say it's separation.

692
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,560
It's a tragic parting.

693
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,640
Is that so?

694
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
Our friendship

695
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
If it's not an ordinary good friend and a foolish brother

696
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,800
Then what about him?

697
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,720
You still see me every day as usual

698
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,440
I still see you every day.

699
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,480
Authoritarianism has imprisoned you.

700
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,720
I'm not confined yet. 

701
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
More confinement can't countless comrades. 

702
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,560
And countless later brothers.

703
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,680
Bannong, you are a great talent.

704
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,240
Zhongfu fortunately met you.

705
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,240
Recite it perfectly.

706
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,120
It is said that Mr Shouchang stayed up all night last night.

707
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,640
Made a long poem.

708
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,880
Let's enjoy it together.

709
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,000
Mr's works

710
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,640
What about this trip? Brother Zhongfu and I

711
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
It's a rebirth of Phoenix.

712
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,240
Although my poem is a bit long 

713
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
But I sincerely hope that you 

714
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,240
Allow me to finish reading it.

715
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,400
To show my admiration for brother Zhongfu.

716
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,080
Is that OK

717
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,960
You got out of prison today.

718
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,040
We are very happy.

719
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
Their power and power

720
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
After all, the truth is invincible

721
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,960
What prison what death?

722
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,960
Can't give in to you.

723
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,360
Because you support the truth.

724
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
So the truth supports you.

725
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,440
You got out of prison today.

726
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,480
We are very happy.

727
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,040
There are many good young people.

728
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,320
I have already implemented your words.

729
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,760
Come out of the lab and go to jail.

730
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,640
Come out of prison and enter the laboratory.

731
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
They all went to prison.

732
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,560
Then the prison becomes a laboratory.

733
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,040
So you live here?

734
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,280
Don't worry, be lonely, have no partner.

735
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,480
When will the seats be opened at this time?

736
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,160
I'm drooling.

737
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:33,520


738
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:33,840
Sorry.

739
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,000
Sorry.

740
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,160
Sorry.

741
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,320
Sorry.

742
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,400


743
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
Come here. I'm sorry.

744
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
I now declare the meeting open.

745
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,320
come on

746
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,360
Yucai

747
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,240
Always pushing others. 

748
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
When does your own table open?

749
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,120
I

750
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,880
Where do I have any seats? 

751
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,640
I'm waiting for your novel feast.

752
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,760
You don't know.

753
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
Spent a lot of time in prison

754
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,320
I spent my time reading your novels.

755
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,000
The new culture movement can't do without it 

756
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,360
Look, sir.

757
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,720
A man's mouth is soft while his hand is short.

758
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,240
Zhongfu, how many days have you not seen me?

759
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,840
The ability to rush the draft can be seen to be long.

760
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
Gentlemen and classmates.

761
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
I still have something to say.

762
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,000
I was a child four years ago.

763
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Manager Wang Meng Zou is Mr. Chen Duxiu.

764
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,560
At a dinner party held at.

765
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
I put that ox hoof 

766
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,840
Changed to a lazy clam.

767
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
I wanted to tease my father.

768
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,600
But today

769
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,600
I made an ox hoof by myself.

770
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
I don't know if it's delicious.

771
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,720
But I want to dedicate it to my father. 

772
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,720
Dedicated to returning to the laboratory from prison

773
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
Mr. Chen Duxiu

774
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,280
Please accept this gift.

775
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,280
Because it represents my apology.

776
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,120
In this dish today

777
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,720
Even if there are otters and clams

778
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,760
I'll eat it, too.

779
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,840
everyone

780
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,760
Gourixin

781
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,600
Ririxin

782
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,200
Yourixin

783
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,240
今天的陈独秀

784
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,080
The same Chen Duxiu.

785
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,720
今天的陈独秀

786
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
It's another brand-new Chen Duxiu.

787
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,000
Comrades

788
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
Today, we Tianjin Student Union

789
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,960
And the women's patriotic comrades' association

790
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,560
Ten men and ten women each.

791
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Because of the common mission

792
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
The common consciousness came together.

793
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,640
Formally set up the Awakening Society.

794
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,480
Our enlightenment club

795
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,080
It is the leading organization of Tianjin students' patriotic movement. 

796
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,680
Our goal is in line with

797
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,360
Carry out introspection and persistent struggle.

798
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,120
Lively and happy! Sacrifice creation

799
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,280
Happy creation

800
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
The spirit of criticism and mutual assistance 

801
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,080
Do a good job in ideological reform of students.

802
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
Lead everyone to self-consciousness and self-determination.

803
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,560
Our determination

804
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
Is to make concerted efforts to walk on the path of enlightenment.

805
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,280
At the same time, I look forward to all the people in society.

806
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
Can walk on the path of enlightenment

807
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,280
Comrades

808
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,720
Because of the need of struggle

809
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,560
The names of the members of our Awakening Society

810
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
Not open to the public

811
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,360
And draw lots.

812
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
Named after the number 

813
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,560
Used as a code for communication.

814
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,840
And the pseudonym of the published article.

815
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,280
There are fifty notes on the table now.

816
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,280
A number is written on each note.

817
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,800
The number you drew.

818
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,200
Is your future correspondence code and pen name.

819
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
Let's start arresting me now.
