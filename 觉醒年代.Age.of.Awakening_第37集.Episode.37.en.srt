[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,987
[Episode Thirty-seven]

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,880
My fellow students.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
We are all witnesses of the May 4th Movement.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
The May 4th Movement was great.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,960
Here, I want to ask you a question.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,360
Why is May 4th Movement great?

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
Large scale and large number of people

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Also all walks of life took part.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,600
Qunxian was right.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,600
But I thought

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
the most important thing about the May 4th Movement,

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,080
is that it is a war against feudalism,

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,920
also a war against imperialism.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
With mass patriotic people voluntarily participated, tried to save themselves.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,440
These few days,

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,720
I was buried in thoughts sitting in the ancestral temple of HanYu.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,120
I realized something,

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,080
that if China seeks development,

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,080
then the path of Russian revolution should be adpoted. 

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
That is the inspiration of the May 4th Movement. 

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,440
Everyone is here today.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,000
I propose

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
Let's restart the reading class in the Red Chamber here.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Let's study together and think thoroughly.

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
Which path can lead to a better China?

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,600
Sounds good?

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,800
Yes.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,800
Brother Yannian.

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,480
Why don't we have a debate right here on the Wufeng Mt.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,440
A vigorous debate between Marxism

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,440
and anarchism.

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,960
Do you dare to take it?

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
Of course I will.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,920
To the very end.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,400
good

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
Speaking of which,

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,360
Mr. Hu Shi

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
published an article

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,080
in the latest Weekly Review.

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,440
Title

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,160
"Focus more on actual problem, less on abstract doctrine."

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,760
It caused wide response.

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,680
Lan Gongwu

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
the one from the research department,

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
also published an article

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
in the National Gazette.

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,560
It's called "Problems and Doctrine"

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,760
These two articles caused quite a controversy now

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
Before I came here

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,880
I visited Mr. Zhongfu.

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
He's a little ambiguous on this issue. 

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,160
He doesn't agree with Mr Hushi,

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
but he also doesn't think Lan Gongwu's words are convincing enough.

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
So he asked me to turn to Mr. Shouchang for some advice.

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,520
Please take a look at this article

57
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Students.

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
I think it is too early for a debate

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
between Marxism

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
and anarchism.

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,200
I reckon

62
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
we should discuss this first.

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
This problem and doctrine from Mr. Hu Shi. 

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
To Mr. Shizhi.

65
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,680
I have read your article

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,520
from the paper came out on the 31st. 

67
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,520
The title is

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,320
"focus more on actual problem, less on abstract doctrine"

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
Inspired by which, I have some thoughts now.

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
Some

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
might can relate to your view,

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,600
some is what I want to tell the whole society.

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
Now I write them all down.

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
Please share your thoughts on this with me.

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,840
Fellow students

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
I asked you to stay at school.

77
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
Because there's something ongoing now might affect you.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,160
Everyone knows

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,280
during the May 4th movement,

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,720
Mr. Mu Ouchu from Shanghai

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,960
made a donation to Peking University,

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
a huge amount of money.

83
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,080
But the student union didn't take it.

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,360
Now, my senior alumnu, Mr. Jiang Menglin

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
entrusted by Mr. Cai

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
manages Peking University.

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
So I asked him.

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
Can we use this money?

89
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
Can we use it

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
To support students with potentials in Peking University

91
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
to study abroad in the States.

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,920
Mr. Jiang agreed.

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
You here are all possible candidates.

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,160
So I kept you late today.

95
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,920
However, there is another reason 

96
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,160
for having you all here today.

97
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,960
I believe that

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,240
you have all read my article

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,520
from Weekly Review came out on th 31st.

100
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,200
"Focus more on actual problem, less on abstract doctrine"

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Everyone here played vital role in the May Fourth Movement.

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,920
I want to talk to you about this article.

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,760
Since the May 4th Movement,

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
many people

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,760
don't talk about specific political issues.

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,160
Instead, they only blabber about Marxism

107
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
and anarchism.

108
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
I can't watch it.

109
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,800
I can't stand it either.

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,760
Because I am a believer in experimentalism.

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,480
I felt provoked, so I want to talk about politics now.

112
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
Which resulted in that article.

113
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,520
I think there is a great danger now.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
That is the empty talk on imported doctrine,

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
and the clueless bias towards theory from foreign paper.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
Instead of actually investigating

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
on what does China today really need. 

118
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,480
Students.

119
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
I have read the article.

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
"Focus more on actual problem, less on abstract doctrine."

121
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,880
from Mr. Hu shi.

122
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,000
I think there are several important issues

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
that I need to clarify with you.

124
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,800
So I wrote this article

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
in this title here.

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
Mr. Shouchang

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Why is that called reconsideration?

128
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,280
Because Lan Gongwu has already published his article on this topic

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
in the National Gazette. 

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
So my one

131
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,760
is the second consideration.

132
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
First of all, 

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,200
I disagree with his view

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,520
that we should focus less on doctrine.

135
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
Given the current situation in China,

136
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,360
the most urgent matter for us

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
is to find a way to save the country 

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
Without doctrine and theory,

139
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
there is no direction.

140
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,680
Looking for a new road without a guide flag

141
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
we may go down a wrong path or worse,

142
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
a dead end.

143
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
Therefore, doctrine

144
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
is curcial.

145
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,760
Sir

146
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
I have read Mr Hu Shi's article.

147
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
He said he felt it deeply,

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,800
the danger behind doctrine.

149
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,160
That danger Mr. Hu Shi talked about,

150
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm afraid it's not caused by doctrine.

151
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,160
What brought it then?

152
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,640
Those who only blabber about doctrine.

153
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I remember Mr. Zhongfu once said that

154
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
what China today desperatly needs

155
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,920
is a theory that can save the nation. 

156
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
So what's the theory, students?

157
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Theory is doctrine.

158
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,480
If China wants to develop,

159
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,720
We must find an advanced theory,

160
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,240
a doctrine.

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,920
Mr. Hu Shi said that

162
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,560
there is fake socialism.

163
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
So we can't talk about it.

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
I don't agree with this either.

165
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
It is true that now

166
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
there are all kinds of socialism being spread around.

167
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
There is the scientific socialism

168
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,320
which we promote.

169
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
There is also An-Fu group's socialism,

170
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,200
also, all kinds of incorrect socialism.

171
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,880
It really tarnished the reputation of scientific socialism.

172
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
But for who wants to seek the truth,

173
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
for who wants to save the country,

174
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
how can you give up the pursuit of scientific truth

175
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,400
just because there is impostors? 

176
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,200
right

177
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
We cannot stop pursuing the truth

178
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
just because those An Fu people

179
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,000
are promoting their version of socialism.

180
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,680
The whole "less on doctrine" view of Mr. Hu shi

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
is actually against solving China's current problems

182
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,680
fundamentally.

183
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
Moreover, it is treating those who seek fundamental solution

184
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,920
as dangerous extremist. 

185
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
He wants people to focus more on problems,

186
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
which is actually advocating improvement over full-scale change.

187
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,320
It's putting band-aid on an open wound instead of healing it completely.

188
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,600
It is wrong and won't work.

189
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,520
Everyone knows that under the dark rule of Beiyang government 

190
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,840
China is a lifeless country.

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
A withered society.

192
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
They would go as far as to turn a school into a prison

193
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
to hold patriotic students.

194
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,000
In such a society

195
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
what practical problems can you solve?

196
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,200
Use all and every tool you have, but there is still no way 

197
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
to bring the hope back.

198
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm afraid at time like this,

199
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,920
we have to find a fundamental solution,

200
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,760
that's the only hope for the actual problems to be solved.

201
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,360
Sir

202
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
I wonder if there is a successful case.

203
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,040
One that focused on doctrine before solving actual problems.

204
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,400
yes

205
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Take Russia as an example.

206
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,600
The means of production shall be owned by the people. 

207
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,400
This is the principle of socialism.

208
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,600
All those problems that could not be solved in the past, 

209
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
now solved.

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
According to Marxist historical materialism

211
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
The foundation of human society is economy.

212
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,480
Issues regarding law,

213
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,680
economic

214
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,640
and community

215
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
things abstract.

216
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
These are all like the surface structures of a building.

217
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Underneath all these structures,

218
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,400
there is the economic. 

219
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
Economic is the foundation.

220
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,200
If the economic structure ever moves,

221
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,400
then all the above structures will shatter.

222
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
So in other words,

223
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
the economic problem is the fundamental problem.

224
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
So once the economic problem is solved,

225
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
then all the other issues

226
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
like politic, law, community

227
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
women's liberation

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,960
and issue regarding workers

229
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
can all be settled.

230
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,680
Sir, could you speak more slowly?

231
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
We can't catch up to you.

232
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
I noticed that your have so many new insights 

233
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
in Marxism recently.

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm working on

235
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,840
the second part of <My View of Marxism>

236
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
That topic just now

237
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,360
we will talk about it sometime.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,280
But not today.

239
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Today I want to talk to you about Bolshevism.

240
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
I have declared publicly that

241
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,640
I am fond of Bolshevism very much.

242
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,320
The day when the Allies won,

243
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
I wrote an article.

244
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,520
It's called "The Victory of Bolshevism"

245
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
Published on the "new youth"

246
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,120
The translation for bolshevism is wrong,

247
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
it's translated to radicalism and maybe that's why

248
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,520
some people say it is a kind of cruel doctrine. 

249
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
That's absurd.

250
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,080
I have a strong feeling.

251
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
The popularity of Bolshevism

252
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
is a great turning point in the human culture.

253
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
We should introduce it.

254
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
We should study it

255
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
and spread it to human society.

256
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,560
Just because there all some rumors about it, 

257
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
doesn't mean we should just believe that and treat Bolshevism negatively.

258
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
Or even eliminate it.

259
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,760
Some time ago, some people said that

260
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,040
After the October Revolution

261
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,040
Krupotkin was exterminated.

262
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
But recently there are reports from the West say that

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
he is safe and sound somewhere near Moscow.

264
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,160
This incident helped clarifying one thing for us.

265
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
A question.

266
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,320
What is Bolshevism?

267
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
Those who advocate not talking about doctrine,

268
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
what they aim at is to against Bolshevism,

269
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,240
to against the scentific principles.

270
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,880
With people like that around, what shall we do then?

271
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
Promoting an abstract dotrine and studying into the practical problems,

272
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,280
they are not contradictory, instead they help each other in many ways.

273
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,720
To solve a widely existing problem in the society,

274
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,880
it has to rely on the common movement of most people in that society.

275
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,640
To have a common movement,

276
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
there must be a common doctrine as the criterion.

277
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
So it is necessary to talk about doctrine. 

278
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Without it,

279
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
without the guidance of scientific theory,

280
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
there is no way to solve those social problems.

281
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,480
Let more people know about the scientific truth

282
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,640
and use this doctrine as a material,

283
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,080
as a tool,

284
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
to solve one practical problem after another.

285
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
As for all those nonsense,

286
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
those who only blabbers,

287
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
let them be.

288
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,160
Radicalism?

289
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
Great diaster and danger?

290
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,360
Calling us heresy?

291
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
They can say whatever they want about us.

292
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,640
Because we don't care about them at all. 

293
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,640
The methods for rescue turned out to be impossible.

294
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,300
Which leads to many unnecessary misery

295
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,560
happened in the history.

296
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
Which one is professor Hu Shi?

297
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,840
I am.

298
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,200
Director Wu asked for you.

299
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,120
Please come to the Metropolitan Police Department with me.

300
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,240
What are you doing?

301
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,040
Yeah, what is it?

302
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
What do you want with Mr. Hu?

303
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
Don't worry, let me do the talking.

304
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,640
What time and what is it about?

305
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm just following my orders.

306
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,960
Please come now.

307
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
Car is waiting outside.

308
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
I don't know what it is about.

309
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
Please.

310
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,960
Sir.

311
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,040
Stay at school.

312
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,400
Wait for me.

313
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,000
Please

314
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Jialun

315
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,640
Sinian

316
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
We need to report this, go.

317
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,640
Go.

318
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
Professor Hu, please sit down for a moment.

319
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Director Wu will be here soon.

320
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,800
Thank you

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
Fellow townsman

322
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
Young fellow.

323
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
Your reputation is at the peak now.

324
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,880
Seems like you will be able to replace Chen Duxiu soon.

325
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,040
Director Wu said we are brothers from the same town.

326
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
That's too much.

327
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,640
Why, is that not true?

328
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
True that we are from same place.

329
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
But I can't not even imagine being your brother.

330
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
After all, we are not the same kind.

331
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
Are you saying I am not a human just like you?

332
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,320
Director Wu, you misunderstood.

333
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,000
I mean

334
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,160
We are not the same kind of people.

335
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,680
We are two people on two different paths.

336
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, since you don't care about talking about hometown.

337
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
Then let's get down to business.

338
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
I was just about to ask Director Wu. 

339
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
You sent a car to bring me here.

340
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
What is the reason?

341
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,920
Please sit down.

342
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,360
Sit down.

343
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,680
Brother Hu

344
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,200
The <Weekly Review>, 

345
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
I don't think it's necessary to continue.

346
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,880
What does this mean?

347
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,160
This is for your own good.

348
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,240
The Weekly Review promotes radical remarks.

349
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,160
Spreading rumors and disturbing the people.

350
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,360
That is a serious allegation.

351
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
I don't think Dierctor has the power

352
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
to stop publication.

353
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,160
Like I said, it's for your own good.

354
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
Look at these.

355
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
These are all evidence materials.

356
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,400
My boss has ordered the Police Department to file a case for investigation.

357
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
I made an exception,

358
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,600
invited you here to talk to you in peace,

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
given that we are from the same town.

360
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
Director Wu, what do you have in mind?

361
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,920
Two ways, you either stop publishing right now.

362
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,280
Or you and others will face investigation and ban by the government.

363
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,720
I advise you to choose the easier one.

364
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,560
Just end it.

365
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,600
<Weekly review>

366
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
It is a registered publication of Peking University. 

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,040
Chen Duxiu is the editor-in-chief.

368
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm just a temporary custodian. 

369
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm afraid I can't make that decision.

370
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,720
I have to say sorry to your kindness, Director Wu. 

371
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,920
Indeed.

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,840
It is precisely because Chen Duxiu is the one in charge

373
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
that I want to talk to you about the situation.

374
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,440
Think about it.

375
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,800
The attention on Chen Duxiu's case has just dropped a bit.

376
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,960
At this time, an investigation on <Weekly Reviw>,

377
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,080
a new case on file, 

378
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,400
it's not gonna help with his case.

379
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,680
Let alone if he can get out or not,

380
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,640
it will be if he can live or not.

381
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
Let me tell you this.

382
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,680
Your decision doesn't matter.

383
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,360
The government will ban it either way.

384
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,440
I say you might as well take the initiative,

385
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,440
give all concerned party an easy way out.

386
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
Then, after some time,

387
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,960
when things are not this tense again. 

388
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,520
You can always apply to run another new paper.

389
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,280
Director Wu, what you meant is that

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,960
if now,

391
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,720
I stop <Weekly Review>,

392
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,160
Zhongfu can come out soon?

393
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,400
Hard to be a good guy these days.

394
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
Why else would I have invited you here?

395
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,400
Have some tea.

396
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
Director Wu, I'll go back and talk to the others.

397
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,880
We will do as you say.

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
Now you see, we are indeed brothers from the same town.

399
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,160
Tea.

400
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,560
Cleaning is also working.

401
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
Labor is also work.

402
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
Focus on your work, everyone.

403
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,920
Yeah.

404
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,040
Mr. Shouchang

405
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Mr. Shouchang, good news

406
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,960
Just got the message.

407
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
"I am fully recovered and will be in Beijing soon."

408
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
"Back to school on the 20th."

409
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,240
From Cai Yuanpei.

410
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,160
Good, great.

411
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,640
Now the rescue movement for Mr.Cai succeed.

412
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
All that's left is brother Zhongfu.

413
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,080
Come on, students, work hard.

414
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,480
come

415
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:52,720


416
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,200
good

417
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,120
Mr. Shouchang.

418
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,880
This is Zhou Enlai from Tianjin Federation of Students. 

419
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
They made a special trip to ask you for advice.

420
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,760
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shouchang.

421
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,040
Nice to see you, students.

422
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,800
Zhou Enlai

423
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,200
I know you.

424
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,680
I read your "Innovation"

425
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,040
Very well written and insightful.

426
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,400
Sir, I'm flattered.

427
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
good

428
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,360
Please sit.

429
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,800
There are stools here.

430
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,680
Enlai

431
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,920
What's the situation like over there?

432
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,600
You might not know.

433
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
The police forced us

434
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
to stop the Tianjin Students' Union Newspaper.

435
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
We're preparing for a reissue.

436
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,680
I heard about it.

437
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,040
Recently the reactionaries are acting aggressively.

438
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,800
The Weekly Review also had to stop.

439
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,560
But our New Youth

440
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,080
will be back again soon. 

441
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,280
We came here with a question.

442
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
We want to know your advice on

443
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,120
how to make patriotic student movement a long-lasting movement.

444
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,320
How to keep it going.

445
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,960
Persistence

446
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
Enlai, you brought this question to me

447
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,040
at the exact right time.

448
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,840
After the issue of Paris peace conference has came to an end.

449
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,720
How to find new goals for the student movement?

450
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
What should we do now?

451
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,920
This is indeed a question worthy of consideration.

452
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
Do you have any ideas?

453
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,480
In Tianjin

454
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,560
There are student associations and women's associations.

455
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
Two main organizations

456
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,560
Which leads to the potential problem

457
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
of unified command and coordination.

458
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,280
So we thought

459
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
can we unify these two organizations?

460
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,560
Among them, the backbone will make up the Awakening Club. 

461
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
On top of leading the student movement,

462
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
we need to strengthen our minds with new knowledge and ideological forces.

463
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,760
We should study new thoughts and ideas, publish publications,

464
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,160
form a core team with the adequate knowledge and skills

465
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
that can take the responsiility as leader of the students.

466
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
I wonder

467
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,960
if you think our idea is feasible?

468
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,960
Very good.

469
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
After what we been through during the May 4th Movement,

470
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
now we are at this place,

471
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
a critical moment needing new guiding ideology.

472
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,320
At such a critical moment, 

473
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,240
Tianjin Federation of Students

474
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,440
chose to take a brave step to break the boundaries between male and female, 

475
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
to organize the essential members

476
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,200
and start this Awakening Club.

477
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,360
Studying, researching and promoting new ideas and knowledge.

478
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
I really think

479
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,920
You are now holding

480
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,840
the core of the student movement.

481
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,440
I like the sound of it.

482
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
I support you.

483
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,080
Good

484
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
We are hoping that

485
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
you can come to Tianjin to give us a speech.

486
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
Share your valuable insights with us, give us the chance to learn.

487
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,040
Well, I'd like to go

488
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,920
But we don't have any funds.

489
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,960
I'm afraid we can't pay you for transportation.

490
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,800
Is that all right?

491
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
No problem, I will take care of that.

492
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
Please tell me if you have any difficulties.

493
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,960
I will do my best to help.

494
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,840
Thank you, sir.

495
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
You are welcome

496
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
So this speech

497
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,840
What do you want me to talk about?

498
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,920
Whatever you want to, Sir.

499
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,800
Right.

500
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
How about this?

501
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,480
Here.

502
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
It's my second half part of 

503
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,800
"My view of Marxism",

504
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,240
it will come out on New Youth, 

505
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,040
next issue.

506
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
I will talk about it.

507
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,000
Marxism

508
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,280
Great

509
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,880
Perfect topic.

510
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Want some noodles with soybean paste?

511
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
Noodles with soybean paste

512
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,640
Of course.

513
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,880
I need to go to a meeting soon.

514
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,600
Shiyan

515
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
Take care of Enlai and the others for me.

516
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,920
Take them to have some noodles.

517
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,720
The usual place.

518
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,760
Longfu Temple.

519
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Big amount, enough for everone.

520
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,920
Thank you, sir.

521
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,840
Jingtan, you saw the bigger picture

522
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,440
on how to deal with this Chen Duxiu problem.

523
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,120
Take a sit.

524
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,200
good

525
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,320
Come and sit.

526
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,440
Jingtan, now North and South is trying to reach an agreement. 

527
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
The southern government insists to release Chen Duxiu. 

528
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
To make sure this agreement goes through smoothly,

529
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,760
we might as well just let Chen Duxiu go.

530
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,800
Mr. President

531
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,040
I have long anticipated this day. 

532
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
I have already prepared for this day.

533
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
Don't worry, I'll do it right away.

534
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
No, no, no

535
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,120
There is more.

536
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,920
Chen Duxiu is a trouble.

537
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,360
We are letting him go,

538
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,720
not setting him free to do whatever he wants.

539
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,720
Even out of the prison,

540
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,640
we need to supervise him.

541
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Otherwise, there will be chaos at any time.

542
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
Jingtan, you have experience.

543
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,080
You need to take more cautions in this respect. 

544
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000
Rest assured, Mr. President.

545
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
I've already made a plan.

546
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,800
Talk to me.

547
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,280
First, the investigation on Chen Duxiu

548
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
has been going on over three months.

549
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,960
We have to give an explanation.

550
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,360
So, we will say it is a granted bail on the ground of sickness. 

551
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,680
Hence, three sponsors are necessary for it.

552
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
They have to be a fellow villager too.

553
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
I volunteer to be one.

554
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,920
He shall find the other two by himself.

555
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,400
Second, after he's released,

556
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,800
there is also probation period.

557
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
He has to report to the police station regularly. 

558
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,760
He can't leave Beijing without permission.

559
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,080
If he agrees to these two articles, 

560
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,680
we will let him go. 

561
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,040
right

562
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
Jingtan, that's very thoughtful.

563
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,440
Do it in your way.

564
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,240
Yes.

565
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Professor Chen Duxiu of Peking University

566
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,240
He has been detained by the Metropolitan Police Department for more than three months.

567
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,680
Given that the investigation by the Police Department

568
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,600
has not shown any illeagl actions carried out by Chen.

569
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,880
Also, considering the three months of prison life

570
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
has caused him stomach illness.

571
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,120
He is now released on bail by fellow Anhui villagers.

572
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
During the time, his actions shall be restricted.

573
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,000
Any major actions must be approved by the government.

574
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,360
Chen Duxiu, you can go now.

575
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
It's our pigeon.

576
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,240
Dad has no right to let it go.

577
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,080
Dad is a bad guy.

578
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Give Yingying back to us.

579
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,600
You silly children, you don't understand.

580
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,680
It's good for it to set it free.

581
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Why are you crying?

582
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,080
How can you know?

583
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
I don't care. I want Ying Ying.

584
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
Let big brother take you to get a new one

585
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,760
How about another Ying Ying?

586
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,080
A new Ying Ying.

587
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I don't want a new one, I want my Yingying

588
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,120
Ying Ying is Ying Ying.

589
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,880
What smells so good?

590
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,240
Hello, Sir.

591
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
Yipin Guo.

592
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Hello, everybody!

593
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,080
Aren't I a lucky one?

594
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,080
A big meal right after I get off the train.

595
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,400
I say you have it all planned, coming at lunch time.

596
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
I am not a free loader.

597
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,080
Here.

598
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,280
You are so polite.

599
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,560
Bringing gifts all the way here.

600
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
Please take a seat.

601
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,720
good

602
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,720
Zhongfu, let me see.

603
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,320
It's okay. Come sit down and talk

604
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,800
Zhonfu

605
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,320
Zhongfu, see who is here.

606
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,040
Zhongfu

607
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,280
I know, you have suffered a lot.

608
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,000
As long as we can win this fight,

609
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,280
I don't mind some suffering,

610
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,040
I can even enjoy it.

611
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,960
Good point!

612
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
We welcome the hero back.

613
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
I'm flattered.

614
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,320
I just went to the birthplace of world civilization,

615
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,920
stayed there for a while.

616
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
What kind of hero is that?

617
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,920
Out of the prison and into the laboratory.

618
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,560
Or go to jail when you leave the lab.

619
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,360
This is the noblest life.

620
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,120
The most beautiful life

621
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Civilization from these two places

622
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,040
is the true civilization,

623
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,480
is a civilization with life and value.

624
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,360
Sir, sit down.

625
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,520
Mr Cai, please sit down.

626
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,640
Come and sit down.

627
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,360
have a seat

628
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,040
have a seat

629
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,000
Sit down, sir.

630
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,760
thank you

631
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,200
Ladies

632
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,080
Gentlemen

633
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,520
Everybody.

634
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,400
Welcome to Mr. Chen Duxiu's glorious release from prison

635
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,960
The welcome banquet begins now. 

636
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,240
First of all, please 

637
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,680
Mr Cai Yuanpei will speak.

638
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,400
I have been away from Peking University for four months.

639
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,240
Today, I can see that

640
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
you still hold the same spirit 

641
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,400
you still have the same ambition.

642
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,640
I feel gratified.

643
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,960
I want to say something.

644
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,640
The first sentence is

645
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,400
We would like to thank Mr. Zhongfu.

646
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,760
Brother Zhongfu here 

647
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
lit the torch of science and democracy for us.

648
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
Though I'm afraid that 

649
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,560
the significance of this torch

650
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
will not be known untill decades later.

651
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
It shows us the direction.

652
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,640
It also illuminates the way forward.

653
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,000
The second sentence is 

654
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Brother Zhongfu, I'm sorry.

655
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,720
Sir

656
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,840
I am saying this from my heart.

657
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,440
Master Cai, I really thank you.

658
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,480
You gave me a stage.

659
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,560
Have a seat

660
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,760
Now we will demonstrate our poems.

661
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,520
During Mr. Zhongfu's imprisonment

662
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,080
we all wrote something

663
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,360
reminding ourselves of Chen Duxiu.

664
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,080
Now Mr. Shizhi

665
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,200
will read his one out.

666
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,680
At this time, I want to borrow the Qupai of Shengchazi.

667
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,440
Recite a little poem of mine.

668
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,680
Share it with all my friends here. 

669
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
Also dedicate this little poem to my beloved friend. 

670
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,160
Mr. Zhongfu.

671
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,280
I'd rather not to miss you.

672
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,240
So I can avoid the lovesickness.

673
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:56,320
Think about it several times.

674
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:10,720
Now I am willing to be lovesick.

675
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,000
Excellent

676
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,920
Now it's Mr. Liu Bannong's turn.

677
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,560
The title of Mr. Wang's poem is of very new style.

678
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,360
It's called <D!>

679
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,400
Zhongfu regained his freedom.

680
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,680
I am very excited

681
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,280
I am going abroad soon.

682
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,720
Before I leave,

683
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,680
finally, I see him again.

684
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,840
I wrote a vernacular poem.

685
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,680
I'll just read a short paragraph.

686
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,960
I haven't seen you for more than eighty days.

687
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,160
People say it's separation.

688
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,560
It's a tragic parting.

689
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,640
Is that so?

690
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
Our friendship

691
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
If it's not for those foolish people

692
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,800
Then whatever happens

693
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,720
You still see me every day as usual

694
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,440
And I still see you every day.

695
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,480
The power has imprisoned you.

696
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,720
I'm not confined. 

697
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Countless comrades are not confined. 

698
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,560
And countless brothers coming after us are not confined.

699
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,680
Bannong, you are a great talent.

700
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,240
It's my luck that I met you.

701
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,240
Great poem.

702
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,120
I heard Mr Shouchang stayed up all night last night.

703
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,640
He wrote a long poem.

704
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,880
Let's hear it together.

705
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,000
From Mr. Shouchang.

706
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,640
Brother Zhongfu and I all had a hard time.

707
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
It's like a rebirth of Phoenix for us.

708
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,240
My poem is a bit long 

709
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
But I sincerely hope that you 

710
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,240
allow me to finish reading it.

711
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,400
To show my admiration for brother Zhongfu.

712
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,080
Is that OK

713
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,960
You got out of prison today.

714
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,040
We are all in great joy.

715
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
Their power, their authoritarianism

716
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
all defeated in front of absolute truth.

717
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,960
Prison? Death?

718
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,960
They can't bend your knees.

719
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,360
You support the truth.

720
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
So the truth supports you.

721
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,440
You got out of prison today.

722
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,480
We are all in great joy.

723
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,040
There are many good young people.

724
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,320
Following your steps.

725
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,760
It's either jail or laboratory.

726
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,640
It's either study or fight.

727
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
They all go to prison.

728
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,560
Then the prison becomes a laboratory.

729
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,040
You can relax there.

730
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,280
As you will never be loney, you never short of campanion.

731
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,480
When shall we start this welcome meal.

732
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,160
I'm drooling.

733
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,320
Sorry.

734
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
Sorry for keep you waiting.

735
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Let's eat now!

736
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,320
come on

737
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,360
Yucai

738
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,240
Always pushing the others. 

739
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
When is your turn?

740
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,120
Me?

741
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,880
What do you mean?

742
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,640
I've been waiting for feast of novel from you.

743
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,760
You don't know.

744
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
In prison

745
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,320
I spent my time reading your novels.

746
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,000
The new culture movement can't do without it 

747
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,360
See.

748
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,720
I have his food in my bowl, now I am in debt to him.

749
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,240
Zhongfu has gained the ability to push people for drafts 

750
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,840
in these days I didn't see him.

751
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
Everyone.

752
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
I have something to say.

753
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,000
I was a child four years ago.

754
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
At a dinner party for Mr. Chen Duxiu

755
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,560
held by Mr. Wang Mengzou,

756
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
I changed an ox hoof dish 

757
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,840
to a lazy frog.

758
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
I wanted to play a joke on my father.

759
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,600
But today

760
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,600
I made an ox hoof dish by myself.

761
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
I don't know if it's delicious.

762
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,720
But I want to dedicate it to my father. 

763
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,720
Dedicated to this return to the laboratory from prison.

764
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
Mr. Chen Duxiu

765
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,280
Please accept this gift.

766
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,280
For it also represents my apology.

767
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,120
Even if there is frog

768
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,720
in this plate today.

769
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,760
I'll still have it.

770
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,840
Everyone

771
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,760
Never be satisfied.

772
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,600
Always learn something new.

773
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,200
Always making progress.

774
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,240
Chen Duxiu today

775
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,080
is still ehe same Chen Duxiu.

776
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,720
Chen Duxiu today

777
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
is also a brand-new Chen Duxiu.

778
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,000
Comrades

779
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
Today, from Tianjin Student Union

780
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,960
and the women's patriotic comrades' association,

781
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,560
ten men and ten women each,

782
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,640
gathered here today.

783
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
For we share the same goal and the same mindset,

784
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,640
we set up this Awakening Club today.

785
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,480
This club

786
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,080
will be the leading organization of Tianjin students' patriotic movement. 

787
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,680
With the spirit of introspection, pratical exercise,

788
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,360
persistence, dedication, joyfulness, 

789
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,120
sacrifice and creation.

790
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
With the spirit of criticism and mutual assistance 

791
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,080
We aim to build a new ideology foundation for students,

792
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
lead everyone to self-consciousness and self-determination.

793
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,560
Our determination

794
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
is to make concerted efforts to walk on the path of enlightenment.

795
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,280
At the same time, we hope to see all people 

796
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
can find the path of enlightenment.

797
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,280
Comrades

798
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,720
Given the current potential danger of this career,

799
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,560
all names of members in the club

800
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
will remain hidden from the public.

801
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,360
So, we will draw from the pool

802
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
to give each one a number

803
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,560
as a code for communication,

804
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,840
also as the pseudonym.

805
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,280
There are fifty notes on the table now.

806
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,280
A number is written on each note.

807
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,800
The number you drew

808
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,200
is your future correspondence code and pen name.

809
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
Let's start now.
