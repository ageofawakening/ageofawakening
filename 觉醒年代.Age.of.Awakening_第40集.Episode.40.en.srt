[Episode Forty]

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,800
dad

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,440
How to speak of the devil

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,840
What delicious food did you bring me, Dad?

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,200
sesame candy

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
How's it going? Have you seen Yannian and them?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,000
Hurry up and slow down

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,600
Finally, they met before they set off.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,960
that's good

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,560
Come into the house

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,960
Brother Zhongfu is at home, right?

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,760
Director Wu

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,440
Yes, madam.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm Wu Bingxiang, director of the Metropolitan Police Department.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,040
Hello, Director Wu

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,320
Come into the house with your mother.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
My front foot just walked in the door.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,680
The luggage hasn't been laid down yet.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
This hind foot followed you in.

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,440
The efficiency of this metropolitan police department is really high. 

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,440
Professor Chen, you left Beijing without permission.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Make so much noise in Wuhan

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
Now I can return to Beijing safely.

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
I have to come to see you.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
Director Wu is very kind.

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,400
Professor Chen, we are fellow villagers. 

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
Naturally, I should take more care of you.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,400
Don't forget that I'm a sponsor when you get out of prison.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm involved.

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,680
clear

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Director Wu

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,240
Have a seat in the house.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,440
No, no, no

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,280
He just came back.

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,280
Professor Chen

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,480
conduct oneself well

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,560
see you again

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,280
good-bye

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,520
good-bye

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,160
A policeman came to your house yesterday. 

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
You just walked in the door.

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
This Wu Bingxiang followed me again.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,440
Is something wrong?

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
They must have read it in the newspaper.

46
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,120
Report on my speech in Wuhan 

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,880
Don't open my luggage like this.

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
I'll go directly to Shizhi's place.

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,720
good

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,760
dodge

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,040
get out of the way

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,240
Get out of the way

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,880
get out of the way

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,320
get out of the way

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,280
dodge

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,120
Shizhi

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,480
respectful form of address for a male friend

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,240
Come in and warm up.

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,240
Brother Zhongfu, you're back.

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Sister in law, do me a favor.

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,080
Go next door and call Gao Yihan for me.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,800
Tell him to call Shouchang Deqian.

63
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,160
Better call Yucai, too.

64
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,000
Good boy, okay, okay, I'm going now

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,160
Brother Zhongfu, what happened?

66
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,440
Call everyone in the cold weather. 

67
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
excuse me

68
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,520
Sit quickly.

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,840
Call you all today.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,320
I want you to help me analyze it.

71
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
Should I leave Beijing?

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
The situation I'm facing at the moment is rather urgent. 

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,400
Jingshi Police Department

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
There is a surveillance post at my door. 

75
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,040
I just got home with my front foot.

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Wu Bingxiang came to warn me.

77
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,760
Do not leave Beijing without permission.

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
That's obviously a thorn in my side. 

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
So it seems more troublesome.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
It's reasonable to go out and hide at this time. 

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,880
But I'm thinking if I do leave.

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
What about New Youth?

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,120
After all, it's not my business alone.

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,360
This Wu Bingxiang is really not a thing

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,280
I say ignore him. 

86
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Is that why I'm going to arrest you again?

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
Don't you talk about the law?

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,920
Don't take it lightly.

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,040
People like Wu Bingxiang

90
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
Anything can be done. 

91
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
Don't expect him to tell you the truth.

92
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
Zhongfu, you don't care too much. 

93
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,160
I read the Wuhan newspaper.

94
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,440
The remarks that appeared in your speech

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,520
Publicly publicize communism

96
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,960
And class struggle theory.

97
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,040
Also said to make what bloody revolution?

98
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
Cancel private ownership

99
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
These remarks are really out of line.

100
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,480
the bird which takes the lead gets shot first―the person in the limelight bears the brunt of attack

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
Why don't you always take lessons? 

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
Shizhi, is it still meaningful to say this now?

103
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
I say simply go to the south.

104
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,160
Open your arms and have a big fight

105
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
To the south.

106
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
Deported

107
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
Shizhi, now we have to go to the south. 

108
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,040
My talent

109
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
Sorry, guys.

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm sorry

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
I got everyone involved.

112
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,760
Well, I think I'd better leave Beijing.

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,280
Chinese New Year is coming soon.

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,440
If I really have something

115
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
Seven-step poems have spoiled everyone's interest.

116
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,360
Brother Zhongfu, where are you going?

117
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,640
I am ready to accept the southern government.

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,280
Offer to prepare for Southwest University

119
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
I want to go to Shanghai first.

120
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,080
The political environment there is better than that in Beijing.

121
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
And the labor and business communities have come to their senses.

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Unlike Beijing, it's still stuffy in the student circle.

123
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
In addition, I also want to put New Youth

124
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,840
Take it to Shanghai, too

125
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,080


126
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,560
New Youth is in Beijing.

127
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,840
Especially in Peking University.

128
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
There is already a broad base.

129
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,160
Why start a new stove?

130
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
I agree with brother Zhongfu.

131
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,760
The New Youth was brought by Zhongfu.

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
Naturally, I should follow you

133
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
No, what's Chen Duxiu called "New Youth"

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,400
No matter "New Youth"

135
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
Go anywhere.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
As long as brother Zhongfu has it. 

137
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
We will continue to support it.

138
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,480
I agree

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,280
agree

140
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
Thank you Yucai

141
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480
Then it's settled.

142
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
I will go to Shanghai by train tomorrow. 

143
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
After arriving in Shanghai

144
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,640
First, I'll ask Zhang Shizhao in the name of the southern government.

145
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
Send an official letter to the Metropolitan Police Department.

146
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
Just tell him I've been hired as

147
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
The organizer of Southwest University.

148
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,480
Then everyone will be out of trouble.

149
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
Besides, after arriving in Shanghai

150
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,560
Put this issue of mine 

151
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,760
New Youth is compiled first.

152
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
We'll discuss the later things.

153
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
This can be the safest way at present.

154
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,320
inspector general

155
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
Our people just went to Jiangan Hutong again.

156
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
陈独秀不在家

157
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,520
Said he was looking for a friend to drink.

158
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
I went drinking.

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,400
Who did you go drinking with?

160
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,560
Don't be a moth.

161
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,040
Don't be an official moth.

162
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,320
yes

163
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,400
Just arrest him. 

164
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,760
Come back, come back.

165
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,600
You do things by yourself.

166
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,320
It's just a rush.

167
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
You don't want to think about what time it is.

168
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
North-South Peace Period

169
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,040
I heard that Chen Jiongming even asked him out. 

170
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
Being the organizer of Southwest University?

171
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
If we act rashly at this time

172
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,280
Arrest him.

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
Can the southern government promise?

174
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,440
Director!

175
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
Chinese New Year is coming soon.

176
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,800
Chen Duxiu is a big hidden danger of public security in Beijing. 

177
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
Look at his speech in Wuhan.

178
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
Intense and dynamic.

179
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
This is devastating.

180
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,600
I know this, I know this.

181
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
You know what?

182
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Send someone to invite him to the hall tomorrow. 

183
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,160
Ask him to write a guarantee.

184
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,000
If he agrees to our terms

185
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,440
Then let him go back.

186
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,240
If he doesn't agree, then detain him. 

187
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
It's easy to tell the outside world.

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,680
tomorrow

189
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,720
tomorrow

190
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,320
got it

191
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
I'll arrange it

192
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,320
good

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Zhongfu

194
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,080
Sister-in-law is here

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,200
Where are you all?

196
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,320
Zhongfu

197
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
The police went to the house to look for you just now. 

198
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
I told them

199
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
You went to a friend's place for a drink.

200
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
They left without saying anything.

201
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,880
But I'm worried about these cops.

202
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
I'll meet you at home later.

203
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,600
I think you should go out and hide now.

204
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,720
Sure enough.

205
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

206
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Brother Zhongfu is staying with us tonight.

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,040
I trust him, Wu Bingxiang.

208
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
You won't come to me to arrest people.

209
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
Brother Shizhi Zhongfu can't stay with you.

210
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
You are also one of the sponsors.

211
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,040
Wu Bingxiang is likely to come here to arrest people.

212
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
I suggest going to my place to hide tonight.

213
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,080
Besides, you can't take the train tomorrow.

214
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Depart from Beijing to Shanghai 

215
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
Because the police have already killed you

216
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
They won't let you go. 

217
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll see you off.

218
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
How about we start from Tianjin?

219
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,840
good

220
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
Leave without delay.

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
中富兄

222
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Today's farewell

223
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
I don't know when I will see you again.

224
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,680
Wait for me. I'll get the wine.

225
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,080
Zhoudiaojiu

226
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,160


227
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,400
Jiuzhoujiu

228
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,480


229
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,120
Jiudiaojiu

230
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
The kind you drank.

231
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Deqian is too late.

232
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,600
I can run there in time.

233
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,400
Deqian

234
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,760
I have flower carvings here.

235
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, yeah, carved wine

236
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
Carved wine can't be cold.

237
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
Bad for health.

238
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll heat it up.

239
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,720
Siblings don't have to 

240
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Wine is cold and heart is hot.

241
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,640
come on

242
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,360
come

243
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Guys!

244
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,280
I arrived in Beijing at the beginning of the Republic of China.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,960
I wanted to.

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,280
Help Cai Yuanpei for three months

247
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,320
I didn't expect this one thousand for three years.

248
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,680
These three years

249
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
I ran New Youth by myself.

250
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Gathered so many fellow brothers.

251
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,320
Start a career.

252
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,560
Set up a banner.

253
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
I have a clear conscience and am very content. 

254
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,320
This cup of wine

255
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
I respect my brothers' love for me.

256
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Jun, you also accompany me.

257
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
Brother Zhongfu, remember a few years ago

258
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,960
Do you know each other in Taoranting? 

259
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
How can I forget that? 

260
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
You warmed up the wine at home 

261
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,480
Afraid of being cold and wrapped in a quilt

262
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,080
Rent a rickshaw to Tao Ranheng.

263
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,120
Long snow and ice

264
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
But we are drinking hot carved wine.

265
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,360
This is also unprecedented and unprecedented. 

266
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
This wine is a little cold today. 

267
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,080
Brother Zhongfu, I used my hands for a while.

268
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,840
You change my bowl.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
That's it.

270
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,640
So inside my chest

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,600
You can burn a fire.

272
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,120
You have snow and carved flowers.

273
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,560
Isn't this the same as that day?

274
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,360
the same as 

275
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
carry sth through to the end

276
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Brother Zhongfu, you are my forever friend.

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,640
中富兄

278
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
I really have to thank you.

279
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,720
Can make me 

280
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
Peer editor of New Youth magazine 

281
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,160
This is what I have gained the most.

282
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,640
The most fulfilling period of feeling.

283
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
I should be the one to say thank you.

284
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,560
Since our "New Youth"

285
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,080
Since the implementation of peer editing

286
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,640
Yi Han wrote a large number of books.

287
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
An extremely heavy article

288
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,800
You are a scientific and democratic idea.

289
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,520
One of the most active propagandists

290
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
It's also our New Youth.

291
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
A worthy hero

292
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,760
Laigan

293
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,720
speak one's mind

294
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,680
No Chen Duxiu forced Zhou Shuren.

295
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
There is no Diary of a Madman.

296
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
And Kong Yiji.

297
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
There is no such person named Lu Xun. 

298
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,640
Brother Zhongfu, I really thank you.

299
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,640
Yucai, I always thought 

300
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,320
You are the most profound novelist in China.

301
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
You have to fight the banner of new culture.

302
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,160
Lu Xun is the real standard bearer.

303
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
Brother Zhongfu, time waits for no man.

304
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,080
good

305
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,640
Go like this.

306
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,160
Don't send either.

307
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
Don't send either.

308
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Brother Zhongfu, this is going south.

309
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
What are you going to do? I want to know 

310
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,520
I was going to ask you the same question.

311
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,440
You said you planned to go to Peking University.

312
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,400
Publicize Marxism with great fanfare

313
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,280
I'm also going to engage in a workers' movement in Changxindian.

314
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,080
Tell me what you think. 

315
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm going to open a few courses first.

316
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,920
Socialism and social movements

317
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,920
historical materialism

318
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,080
International movement of workers

319
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
And the future of socialism.

320
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Besides, I plan to stay in Peking University.

321
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,880
Run a Marxist theory research society.

322
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,960
I also discussed it with Zhongxia.

323
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,680
I want to go to Changxindian to run night classes for workers.

324
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,280
Organize workers' movement

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,440
Organize workers' club

326
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,040
I think this May Fourth Movement

327
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,320
The reason why we were able to win

328
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,680
A very important one.

329
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
That is, the working class in Shanghai has risen.

330
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,440


331
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:37,600


332
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:37,840
right

333
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I said that the political environment in Shanghai is better than that in Beijing.

334
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,720
It refers to this.

335
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,120
According to Marx's theory

336
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,160
The class is the advanced representative of productive forces. 

337
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Should be the leading class of the revolutionary movement.

338
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,080
be

339
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,840
Shouchang, what you said is a process.

340
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
Have you thought about it?

341
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
What is our self-label?

342
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,920
Why do we leave our wives behind?

343
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,400
Abandon one's family business and hide in hiding. 

344
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,840
You may even lose your life.

345
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
What are we after?

346
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
Mom, I'll help you.

347
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,880
good

348
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,880
I'll slow down.

349
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,360
Go forward.

350
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200
Slow, slow, slow, slow

351
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,000
What are you doing?

352
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,240
Thousands of you?

353
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
Why did you come in without saying hello?

354
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,120
Hello, Jenny

355
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,640
Is Mr. Wang back?

356
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,000
He's not here.

357
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
Where have you been?

358
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,240
I don't know.

359
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,960
Where are you going?

360
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
Clean up the bad things I don't use at home.

361
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,960
Throw it out.

362
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,840
not have

363
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,640
not have

364
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,440
not have

365
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,480
wife of one's teacher/master

366
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,400
If sir comes back 

367
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,880
Please ask him to go to the Metropolitan Police Department. 

368
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,720
Have something important to discuss.

369
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,360
Thank you for your cooperation.

370
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,920
The box is a little heavy. 

371
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
turn around

372
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,600
quick march

373
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,320
Zimei

374
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,520
mother

375
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
english-english

376
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,240

00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:04,560


378
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:04,720


379
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,760
Ying Ying is back.

380
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Ying Ying is back.

381

english-english

382
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,480
get down

383
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Come down quickly!

384
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:20,960
Ying Ying, come down.

385
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,040


386
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,560
Ying Ying, come down.

387
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,840
Ying Ying, come down.

388
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,080
Ying Ying (come down!

389
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,240
Ying Ying, come down.

390
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Ying Ying, come down.

391
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,480
Ying Ying, come down!

392
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,360
Ying Ying, come down!

english-english

400
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,120
In fact, in recent days

401
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,240
I've been thinking about drinking in your house.

402
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
Shizhi asked me that sentence.

403
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
He said that we are all Lyu3 bu4.

404
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,920
Ma Chi rabbit has been killed.

405
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,800
Why abandon your wife and children?

406
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,800
What exactly do we want?

407
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,760
Brother Zhongfu, I also want to ask you

408
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
Have you made this problem clear?

409
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,560
I think I've figured it out. 

410
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
I think I figured it out, too.

411
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,280
Our country

412
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,120
It has created the greatest number of people

413
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,480
The most splendid civilization

414
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
But after the Opium War?

415
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
Our country is sinking rapidly.

416
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,640


417
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,560
unknown

418
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
But in 80 years.

419
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,240
Our country

420
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,560
Has become the poorest in the world.

421
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,480
The country with the least dignity

422
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
Warlords and bandits are rampant.

423
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,000
People are displaced.

424
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
Live a miserable life.

425
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,160
What about us?

426
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,120
Is one of the few intellectuals in this country.

427
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
A literate person is a civilized person.

428
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,880
Civilized people should 

429
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,560
Be responsible for our country and people.

430
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,240
We have the responsibility to lead the people in their struggle. 

431
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
We're going to use what Marx created

432
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,560
Principles of scientific socialism

433
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
We should build a system of not being bullied by foreigners.

434
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,440
Not oppressed by rulers

435
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,040
There is no corrupt official.

436
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Everyone can be the master.

437
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
Everyone can live in

438
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,880
A beautiful society with equal life.

439
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,040
Brother Zhongfu, I think this is history.

440
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
Our responsibilities and responsibilities

441
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,320
None of us can let it down. 

442
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
寿昌说得好

443
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,320
But what are we going to rely on?

444
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
To fulfill this responsibility and responsibility.

445
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,480
organization

446
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,320
We should have one.

447
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,960
An organization and leadership core that can gather strength. 

448
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,720
Brother Zhongfu, I think this matter

449
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
It should be on the agenda.

450
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
This matter is too important.

451
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
I need you to make a good plan

452
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,720
What did you say?

453
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,600
People disappeared overnight. 

454
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,160
Is there really a moth? 

455
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,360
Subordinate analysis

456
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,040
Chen Duxiu must be hiding in someone's house. 

457
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,480
Ready to sneak out of Beijing.

458
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,560
You mean he hasn't left yet?

459
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,320
It snowed so heavily.

460
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,520
How did he get out of town alone?

461
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,320
impossible

462
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,360
I suggest

463
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,280
Let's add hidden posts at Qianmen Railway Station.

464
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,800
He is likely to escape by train.

465
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,920
You know what?

466
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,040
Take my film.

467
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,520
Give me Hu Shi, please

468
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm going to ask him as a sponsor.

469
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,720
be

470
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
Two gentlemen

471
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
Look, you are learned people.

472
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,840
Have pity on me.

473
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,880
Starving granddaughter, right?

474
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,360
You sound like you're from the south.

475
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,680
Fengyang, Anhui

476
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Fengyang

477
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
Fengyang is a good place. 

478
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,120
A thousand walks are worse than two banks of Huaihe River.

479
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,080
How can there be famine this year?

480
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,600
Make a famine

481
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,400
Plague

482
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,160
Make bandits

483
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,000
Make a fuss.

484
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,760
You can't live with anything.

485
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
And escaped.

486
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
old man

487
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,160
This winter's

488
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,080
Why don't you go south?

489
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,000
Originally, our family

490
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
Want to go to Jinan to go to relatives

491
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,480
I didn't expect to fight all the way. 

492
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,040


493
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,280
There are refugees everywhere.

494
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,640
There are refugees everywhere

495
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
Relatives were not found.

496
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,800
This followed the big slip to Tianjin Wei.

497
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
Are all the refugees from Anhui? 

498
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
There are everywhere.

499
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,040
Shanxi, Henan

500
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
Hebei

501
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,640
Shandong is in great trouble this year.

502
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
The most people came out to escape.

503
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
You take it.

504
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,800
It's no use giving it to me.

505
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,160
Do you have anything to eat? 

506
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,160
Keep it. It will work. 

507
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
Good man?

508
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,720
Children, give them their heads.

509
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:40,800


510
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,520
Children, kowtow to them.

511
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
This is a benefactor.

512
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,640
No, no, no

513
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,280
Good man?

514
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,280
Thank you benefactor

515
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,160
Wife, son

516
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,800
I brought you a boat.

517
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
You go over there.

518
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,240
Don't freeze, don't be hungry.

519
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
There is a habit of lighting rivers in the north.

520
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,040
Pay homage to the dead

521
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,120
old man

522
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,520
old man

523
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,160
You light so many lights!

524
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,040
There are many friends and brothers over there.

525
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,840
I can't leave them alone. 

526
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,360
You are paying homage to a friend. 

527
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,120
It was the Boxer Rebellion that year.

528
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,840
A brother who risked his life.

529
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
I've been dead for twenty years.

530
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,320
They were killed by foreigners for their country.

531
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,160
At the time of death

532
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Everyone is a lively little ye.

533
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,800
My daughter-in-law left without marrying.

534
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm the only one left

535
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,200
I can't leave it alone.

536
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
They died for their country.

537
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,240
It's worth dying for

538
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,280
Worth a fart

539
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,760
I'll send them lights today.

540
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,480
Is to give them cry foul.

541
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,920
Die for a country like this.

542
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,960
It's a sucker

543
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Look at this river bank.

544
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,600
Over the years.

545
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
One hundred and sixty days a year

546
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
Which day is not full of victims? 

547
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,200
Starving to death, freezing to death, dying of illness

548
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Throw it on the side of the road and no one will bury it.

549
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,040
You are white flour scholars.

550
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,480
I just want to ask.

551
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Can such a country still be saved?

552
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Doesn't the government care?

553
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,600
government

554
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
I've never seen such an asshole government.

555
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,040
When did they care?

556
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,360
The lives of ordinary people!

557
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,920
When Eight-Nation Alliance came in.

558
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,560
This Haihe River floats everywhere. 

559
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,640
Are the heads of Chinese households.

560
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
Some lost their heads. 

561
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,920
Some limbs are incomplete.

562
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,200
Some women are naked.

563
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,440
Kena

564
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,160
Poor thing!

565
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,400
Kena

566
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:28,560
Poor thing!

567
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,680
Common people's hardships

568
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,520
Get used to it for so many years.

569
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,240
Shouchang

570
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,880
Shouchang

571
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,640
i figured it out

572
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,560
We have to build a party.

573
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,600
We have to have a strong leadership core.

574
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,840
What kind of party do you want to build?

575
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,040
One uses Marx's theory 

576
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
Armed advanced political parties

577
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,280
One can lead China to the light.

578
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,360
Let Chinese people live a good life.

579
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,600
Proletarian political party

580
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Why did you build this political party?

581
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,320
No reason

582
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,080
I did it for them.

583
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,920
I did it for them.

584
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,160
I did it for them.

585
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,200
Be able to live like a human being.

586
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,640
In order that they can have human rights.

587
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,800
People's happiness

588
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
Human dignity

589
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,280
好中富兄

590
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,600
Let's swear to these compatriots.

591
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,600
come

592
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's announce

593
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,120
To keep you from being displaced.

594
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
In order to let the Chinese people

595
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,680
Live a rich and happy life

596
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
To stop the poor from being bullied.

597
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,200
Everyone can be the master.

598
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,040
For everyone to be educated.

599
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,720
There is little to teach and old to depend on.

600
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,800
For the Chinese people's prosperity and national strength.

601
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,400
For national reconstruction and rejuvenation

602
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,560
I am willing to fight all my life.

603
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,240
I am willing to fight all my life.

604
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:23,440
Organization, known in history as South Chen Bei Li made an appointment to found the party.

605
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Brother Shizhi, please sit down.

606
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,560
Sit down.

607
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:30,800
Sit down.

608
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,120
Sit down.

609
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,680
This Chen Duxiu has left Beijing. 

610
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,360
I left that night.

611
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
How did he die?

612
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm not sure how to go. 

613
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,640
Half a moment!

614
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,040
He left a letter for you.

615
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,360
Director Wu

616
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,120
In the summer, I am grateful for the preferential treatment.

617
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,480
I received a telegram from a friend here a few days ago.

618
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,120
Come to discuss with Southwest University.

619
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,480
Departure is not enough to report to the hall.

620
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm sorry

621
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,160
Hereby, I am writing to supplement you. 

622
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,440
Hope for the original 

623
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,760
Go back to Beijing as soon as you can. 

624
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,200
Thank you for your face again

625
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,640
Please honor Chen Duxiu. 

626
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,560
This Chen Duxiu is interesting

627
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,840
deserve the name of a true friend 

628
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
He's a sponsor for both of us.

629
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,440
Unload the responsibility

630
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,760
Zhongfu, he has always been a man who values love and righteousness. 

631
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,120
He also said

632
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
In two days, let the southern government

633
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
Write a special official letter to you. 

634
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,960
In this case, you will be completely irresponsible.

635
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,560
Ok, it's going to rain, and my mother is going to get married.

636
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,760
Suck It Up

637
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,120
Do you know

638
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't think you can compare Shanghai with Beijing

639
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,520
I don't think you can compare it.

640
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,800
They are so different.

641
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
Just like Beijing.

642
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,840
There is a sandstorm

643
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,040
I can't cope with it

644
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,080
I really can't cope.

645
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,600
Unable to cope with sandstorm

646
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,280
There will be rain in Shanghai. 

647
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,920
Sometimes it's wet.

648
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,200
But to be honest, I really don't like Shanghai.

649
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,960
But Beijing

650
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,080
Honestly, I can live there.

651
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,400
Because of the difference in weather

652
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,640
I think it is more 

653
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,760
Differences between Beijing and Shanghai

654
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,720
Still very interesting.

655
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,200
I mean

656
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,680
This is a different kind of comparison.

657
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
It's like comparing night with day. 

658
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,440
Thank you very much.

659
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,600
The relationship between them is really important.

660
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,120
寿昌先生

661
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,880
I'll go first if you are busy.

662
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,840
Please walk slowly.

663
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,160
寿昌先生

664
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,720
Runzhi

665
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,080
I lost weight, too.

666
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,720
But more energetic.

667
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,760
nicely

668
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,840
sir

669
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,080
Thanks to Jenny's two cans of Chili oil

670
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,040
Just in time

671
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
Otherwise, I may not be able to stand it.

672
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
I'll ask her to make more for you.

673
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,680
Put more chili.

674
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,960
Get it

675
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,920
Give me

676
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,560
Sit, sit

677
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:24,800
Sit, sit

678
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,440
Sit, sit

679
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,080
来润之

680
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,480
sit

681
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,640
Give me a minute.

682
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,640
润之啊

683
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,840
How's the Zhang-expelling movement going in Hunan?

684
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,720
Tell me about it quickly.
