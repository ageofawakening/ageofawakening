[Episode Forty]

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,800
Daddy！

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,440
Speak of the devil.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,840
Did you bring something delicious for me, Daddy?

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,200
Sesame candy

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
How's it going? Have you seen Yannian and Qiaonian?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,000
Managed to get there just in time.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,600
Had chance to meet them before they left.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,960
That's good

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,560
Come into the house.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,960
Brother Zhongfu is at home, right?

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,760
Director Wu

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,440
Good day, Mrs.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm Wu Bingxiang, director of the Metropolitan Police Department.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,040
Hello, Director Wu

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,320
Come into the house with your mother.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
I just walked into the door,

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,680
didn't even put my suitcase down,

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
and you are here already.

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,440
How efficient your people work. 

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,440
Professor Chen, you left Beijing without permission.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Then you made a scene in Wuhan.

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
Now that you finally came back to Beijing.

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
How can I not pay a visit.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
Director Wu is very kind.

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,400
Professor Chen, we are fellow villagers. 

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
Naturally, I should take more care of you.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,400
Don't forget that I'm a sponsor when you get out of prison.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm involved here.

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Clear.

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Director Wu

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,240
Have a seat in the house.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,440
No, no, no

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,280
He just came back.

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,280
Professor Chen

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,480
Please behave yourself.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,560
I will see you again.

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,280
good-bye

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,520
good-bye

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,160
A policeman came looking for you yesterday as well. 

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
Now you just arrived,

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
Wu Bingxiang were right after you.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,440
Is something wrong?

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
They must have read it in the newspaper.

46
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,120
Report about my speech in Wuhan 

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,880
Don't bother sort out my stuff.

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
I'll go directly to Shizhi's place.

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,720
Okay.

50
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,040
get out of the way

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,240
Get out of the way

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,880
get out of the way

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,320
get out of the way

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,120
Shizhi

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,480
My brother

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,240
Come in and warm up.

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,240
Brother Zhongfu, you're back.

58
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Can you do me a favor.

59
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,080
Can you go next door and get Gao Yihan for me.

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,800
Tell him to bring Shouchang and Deqian.

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,160
Better call Yucai, too.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, I'm going now

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,160
Brother Zhongfu, what happened?

64
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,440
Having all these people here in this cold weather. 

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
Excuse me

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,520
Take a seat.

67
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,840
I invited you all here today

68
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,320
because I want to know about your views on this.

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
Should I leave Beijing?

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
The situation I'm facing at the moment is rather urgent. 

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,400
The Police

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
has set a surveillance post right at my door. 

73
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,040
Seconds after I arrived at my house,

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Wu Bingxiang came to warn me,

75
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,760
that I can not leave Beijing without permission.

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
Now I am clearly targeted.

77
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
That's a tricky situation indeed.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
I should probably just leave for safety.

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,880
But I was wondering that If I leave,

80
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
what about New Youth?

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,120
After all, it's not my business alone.

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,360
This Wu Bingxiang is really shameless.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,280
I say just ignore him. 

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
He can't put you back in jail just for that.

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
Where is the law and regulation then

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,920
There is no such thing as being too cautious.

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,040
People like Wu Bingxiang

88
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
they can do everything.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
Law and regulation is not gonna stop him.

90
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
Zhongfu, you should pay more attention anyway.

91
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,160
I read the Wuhan newspaper.

92
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,440
The remarks that appeared in your speech.

93
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,520
You openly publicized communism,

94
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,960
theory of class struggle.

95
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,040
You also mentioned evolution with bloodshed,

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
demolishing private ownership.

97
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
These remarks are really out of line.

98
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,480
Of course they would go after you.

99
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
Why can't you learn your lessons?

100
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
Shizhi, is it even meaningful to say this now?

101
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
I say you might as well go bold.

102
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,160
Go to the South and start your fight there.

103
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
The South?

104
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
Zhongfu just barely escaped from Wuhan.

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
Shizhi, now we have to go to the south.

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,040
Or...

107
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
Sorry, guys.

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm sorry

109
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
I got everyone involved.

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,760
Well, I think I'd better leave Beijing.

111
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,280
Chinese New Year is coming soon.

112
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,440
If something really happens to me,

113
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
everyone is not gonna enjoy and relax during the time.

114
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,360
Brother Zhongfu, where are you going?

115
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,640
I'm thinking accept the offer to teach in the Southwest University

116
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,280
from the Southern Government.

117
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
I want to go to Shanghai first.

118
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,080
The political environment there is better than that in Beijing.

119
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
Plus the labor and business communities have been exposed to the new ideology for a long time.

120
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Unlike Beijing, all those happened were only in the student's group.

121
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
In addition, I also want to bring New Youth

122
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,840
to Shanghai,

123
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,080
if you here will agree with that.

124
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,560
In Beijing,

125
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,840
especially in Peking University,

126
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
New Youth has already built a solid base.

127
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,160
Why start from the beginning in a different place?

128
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
I agree with brother Zhongfu.

129
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,760
The New Youth was brought by Zhongfu.

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
Naturally, it should follow you

131
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
New Youth is not New Youth without Chen Duxiu.

132
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,400
No matter where it goes,

133
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
where it stays,

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
as long as brother Zhongfu is taking care of it,

135
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
we will support as always.

136
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,480
I agree

137
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,280
agree

138
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
Thank you Yucai

139
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480
Then it's settled.

140
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
I will go to Shanghai by train tomorrow. 

141
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
After arriving in Shanghai

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,640
I'll ask Zhang Shizhao in the name of the southern government

143
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
to send an official letter to the Metropolitan Police Department first thing.

144
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
Informing them that I accepted the job

145
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
as the organizer of Southwest University.

146
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,480
Then everyone will be out of trouble.

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
Besides, after arriving in Shanghai

148
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,560
I will finish the next issue

149
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,760
of New Youth.

150
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Things after that, we will discuss another time.

151
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
Sure, it seems like the safest way now.

152
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Director.

153
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
Our people went to Jiangan Hutong again just now.

154
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Chen Duxiu was not home.

155
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,520
Looks like he went to drink with some friends.

156
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
Drinking.

157
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,400
Who did he go drinking with?

158
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,040
This better not be causing troubles.

159
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,320
Indeed.

160
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,400
I say we just arrest him.

161
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,760
Come back, come back.

162
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,600
You have to stop this.

163
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,320
Always act without thinking.

164
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
Think about the grand scheme now.

165
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
It is North-South Peace Period.

166
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,040
I heard that Chen Jiongming even invited him out,

167
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
offering him a job as the organizer of Southwest University.

168
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
If we act rashly at this time,

169
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,280
arrest him,

170
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
will the Southern Government just sit and do nothing?

171
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,440
Director!

172
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
It's Chinese New Year soon.

173
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,800
Chen Duxiu is a potential danger of public security in Beijing. 

174
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
Look at his speech in Wuhan.

175
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
Aggresive and inflammatory.

176
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
That can possibly cause a lot of damages.

177
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,600
I understand what you said.

178
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
You know what?

179
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Send someone to invite him to the hall tomorrow. 

180
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,160
Ask him to write a guarantee.

181
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,000
If he agrees to our terms

182
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,440
Then let him go back.

183
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,240
If he doesn't agree, then detain him. 

184
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Make it acceptable for the public.

185
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,680
tomorrow

186
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,720
tomorrow

187
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,320
got it

188
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
I'll arrange it

189
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,320
good

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Zhongfu

191
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,080
Mrs. Chen.

192
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,200
You are all here.

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,320
Zhongfu

194
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
The police went to the house to look for you just now. 

195
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
I told them

196
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
You went to a friend's place for a drink.

197
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
They left without saying anything.

198
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,880
But I'm worried

199
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
They might come again later.

200
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,600
I think you should go hide now.

201
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,720
I saw that coming.

202
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
Don't worry.

203
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Brother Zhongfu can stay here tonight.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,040
I say even Wu Bingxiang

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
dare not to just come here and arrest people.

206
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
Shizhi, Zhongfu can't stay with you.

207
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
You are one of the sponsors.

208
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,040
Wu Bingxiang is likely to come here looking for him.

209
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
I say you stay at my place tonight.

210
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,080
Besides, you can't take the train

211
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
departing from Beijing to Shanghai tomorrow. 

212
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
The police will be waiting.

213
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
They won't let you go. 

214
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll take you,

215
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
we go to Tianjin and you leave to Shanghai there.

216
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,840
Ok.

217
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
We need to move fast.

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Brother Zhongfu.

219
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
After today's farewell,

220
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
I don't know when I will see you again.

221
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,680
Wait for me. I'll get the wine.

222
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
Good one, Hua Diao.

223
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
The kind you had before.

224
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Deqian, we don't have time now.

225
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,600
I will run, we can make it.

226
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,400
Deqian

227
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,760
I have Hua Diao at home.

228
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, yeah, we do.

229
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
Can't have it cold

230
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
Bad for health.

231
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll heat it up.

232
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,720
Dont' worry.

233
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Wine might be cold, but our blood is hot.

234
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,640
come on

235
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,360
come

236
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Guys!

237
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,280
I came to Beijing at the beginning of 1917.

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,960
Originally just helping Cai Yuanpei out

239
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,280
for only three months.

240
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,320
I didn't expect that three months turned into three years.

241
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,680
These three years

242
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
from starting New Youth by myself

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
to have so many fellow brothers.

244
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,320
We built a career together.

245
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,560
We set up a banner together.

246
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
I have no regret and no shame at these past three years.

247
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,320
This cup of wine

248
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
is in respect of all fellow brothers' love for me.

249
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Junman, have it with me.

250
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
Brother Zhongfu, do you still remember a few years ago

251
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,960
when we met each other at Tao Ran Temple?

252
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
How can I forget that? 

253
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
You warmed up the wine at home ,

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,480
you were afraid of it getting cold,

255
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,080
so you wrapped it in a quilt, rent a rickshaw,

256
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,120
brought it all the way in that freezing day.

257
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
We had hot Hua Diao wine in that snowy winter.

258
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,360
No one will do that again I guess.

259
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
This wine is a little cold today. 

260
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,080
Brother Zhongfu, I used my hands to warm it up a little.

261
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,840
Have this one instead.

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
This will do.

263
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,640
Now in my chest,

264
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,600
I have a warm fire lightening up. 

265
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,120
You, snow and Hua Diao wine,

266
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,560
isn't this the same as that day?

267
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,360
The same indeed.

268
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
We had our start, now we have our end.

269
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Brother Zhongfu, you are my friend forever.

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,640
Brother Zhongfu.

271
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
I really have to thank you.

272
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,720
For you made me 

273
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
a peer editor of New Youth.

274
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,160
I gained so much and I felt so cheerful

275
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,640
during this time.

276
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
I should be the one to say thank you.

277
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,560
Since "New Youth" adpoted this system

278
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,080
with the peer editors.

279
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,640
Yi Han wrote many important papers

280
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
for our New Youth.

281
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,800
You are one of the most active in promoting 

282
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,520
scientific and democratic ideaology.

283
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
You are one crucial member

284
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
of New Youth.

285
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,760
Cheer.

286
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,720
I am speaking genuinely here.

287
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,680
Without Chen Duxiu pushing Zhou Shuren,

288
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
there wouldn't be the <Diary of a Madman>

289
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
and <Kong Yiji>.

290
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
There wouldn't be an author goes by the name Lu Xu.

291
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,640
Brother Zhongfu, truly, thank you.

292
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,640
Yucai, I always thought that

293
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,320
you are the most profound novelist in China.

294
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
You are the one standing at the front and holding the banner of new culture.

295
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,160
Lu Xun is that person.

296
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
Brother Zhongfu, we have to move now.

297
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,080
I see.

298
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,640
Well, that's it.

299
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,160
Stay.

300
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
Stay.

301
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Brother Zhongfu, I want to know

302
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
what's your plan after you got there?

303
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,520
I was going to ask you the same question.

304
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,440
You said you planned to start promoting Marxism openly in Peking University,

305
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,400
and encourge laborers and workers to start a new movement.

306
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,280
in Chang Xin Dian.

307
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,080
Tell me how you plan to do it. 

308
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm starting a few courses in Peking University first.

309
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,920
Socialism and social movements.

310
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,920
Historical materialism.

311
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,080
International movement of workers.

312
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
The future of socialism.

313
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
I also plan to establish a Marxist theory research club 

314
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,880
in Peking University.

315
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,960
I also discussed it with Zhongxia.

316
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,680
I want to run night classes for workers in Chang Xin Dian.

317
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,280
Organizing workers' movement,

318
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,440
and starting a workers' club.

319
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,040
I believe among all the reasons 

320
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,320
why the May Fourth Movement was a success.

321
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,680
A very important one is

322
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
the working class in Shanghai stood out and fought.

323
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:37,840
Right.

324
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I said that the political environment is better in Shanghai than Beijing,

325
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,720
this is why.

326
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,120
According to Marx's theory,

327
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,160
The working class is the pioneer representative of productive forces. 

328
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
The working class should be the leading class of the revolutionary movement.

329
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,080
Yes.

330
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,840
Shouchang, what you said is the process.

331
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
Have you thought about it?

332
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
What is our ultimate goal?

333
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,920
We left our family, wife and kids.

334
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,400
We left what we have behind and kept hiding.

335
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,840
We might even lose our lifes.

336
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
All these and what are we after for?

337
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
Mom, I'll help you.

338
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,880
Sure.

339
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,880
I'll slow down.

340
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,360
Move.

341
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200
Slow, slow, slow, slow

342
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,240
What are you doing?

343
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
You just came in without even knocking?

344
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,120
Nice to meet you, Mrs.Chen.

345
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,640
Is Mr. Chen back?

346
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,000
He's not here.

347
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
Where is he?

348
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,240
I don't know.

349
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,960
Where are you going?

350
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
Clean up some broken stuff.

351
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,960
Throw it out.

352
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,840
Not here.

353
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,640
Not here.

354
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,440
Not here.

355
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,480
Mrs.Chen.

356
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,400
If he comes back,

357
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,880
please ask him to go to the Metropolitan Police Department. 

358
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,720
There's something important to discuss.

359
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,360
Thank you for your cooperation.

360
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,920
By the way, that is one heavy suitcase. 

361
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
Turn around.

362
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,600
March.

363
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,320
Zimei

364
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,520
Mom.

365
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
Yingying

366
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,240
Yingying

367
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,760
Yingying is back.

368
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Yingying is back.

369
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,120
Yingying

370
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,480
Come down

371
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Come down quickly!

372
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,560
Yingying, come down.

373
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
Yingying, come down.

374
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Ying Ying, come down.

375
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,480
Yingying.

376
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,360
Yingying, come down.

377
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,560
Yingying.

378
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,840
Yingying.

379
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,200
Yingying.

380
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,480
Yingying.

381
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
Yingying.

382
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,440
Yingying.

383
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,120
Recently I've been thinking

384
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,240
that day we had drinks at your place,

385
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
Shizhi asked me something.

386
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
He said that we all have a good life,

387
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,920
we all have some level of achivements.

388
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,800
Why we still choose to leave the wife and children?

389
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,800
What is it that we want?

390
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,760
Brother Zhongfu, I want to ask you

391
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
Have you find your answer?

392
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,560
I think I've figured it out. 

393
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
I think I figured it out, too.

394
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,280
Our country,

395
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,120
it once created the most splendid civilization

396
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,480
in the human history.

397
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
But after the Opium War?

398
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
Our country is sinking rapidly.

399
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,640
We sunk so fast and so badly,

400
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,560
no one has ever seen something like this happened before.

401
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
In only 80 years,

402
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,240
our country

403
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,560
has become the poorest in the world,

404
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,480
it became a country with the least dignity.

405
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
Warlords and bandits are laughing and cheering.

406
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,000
People lost their home and everything they had.

407
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
They live a miserable life.

408
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,160
As for you and me,

409
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,120
we are one of the few intellectuals in this country.

410
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
We are the few civilized people.

411
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,880
Civilized people should be and have to be

412
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,560
taking responsibility for our country and people.

413
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,240
It's our duty to lead the people to fight. 

414
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
We're going to use what Marx created

415
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,560
the principles of scientific socialism,

416
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
we are to build a soceity,

417
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,440
where we will not be bullied by foreign invadors, 

418
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,040
we will not be oppressed by corrupted rulers.

419
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Where everyone can be their own master,

420
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
everyone can live their life peacefully 

421
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,880
and everyone is equal.

422
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,040
Brother Zhongfu, I believe this is responsibility and duty been assigned to us

423
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
It is our obligation in this difficult time.

424
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,320
We can not let it down. 

425
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
Well said, Shouchang.

426
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,320
But how can we exactly fulfill that?

427
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
What tool and means do we have?

428
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,480
An organization.

429
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,320
We need an organization to bring people together

430
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,960
and a core leadership to lead the way.

431
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,720
Brother Zhongfu, this matters a lot.

432
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
We should put it on the agenda now.

433
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
It is so important,

434
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
we need to work carefully on that.

435
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,720
What did you say?

436
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,600
He disappeared overnight? 

437
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,160
So it's gonna cause trouble afterall.

438
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,360
I think

439
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,040
Chen Duxiu must be hiding in someone's house,

440
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,480
planning to sneak out of Beijing.

441
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,560
You mean he hasn't left yet?

442
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,320
It's snowing so heavily.

443
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,520
How could he get out of town alone?

444
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,320
Impossible

445
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,360
I suggest

446
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,280
Let's put more people at Qianmen Railway Station.

447
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,800
He is likely to escape by train.

448
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,920
You know what?

449
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,040
Take my card.

450
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,520
Grab me Hu Shi.

451
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,920
He is the sponsor, I will ask him.

452
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,720
Yes.

453
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
Two gentlemen

454
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
You both seem well-educated, sir.

455
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,840
Have pity on me.

456
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,880
Please help us, my granddaughter is starving.

457
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,360
You sound like you're from the south.

458
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,680
Fengyang, Anhui

459
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Fengyang

460
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
Fengyang is a good place. 

461
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,120
Places along Huaihe River is famous for being prosperous.

462
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,080
How come there is famine this year?

463
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,600
Famine.

464
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,400
Plague

465
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,160
Bandits

466
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,000
Warlords.

467
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,760
It everything but prosperous.

468
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
So we ran away.

469
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
Grandpa.

470
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,160
It's winter in the north now.

471
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,080
Why didn't you go south?

472
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,000
Originally, our family

473
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
were going to Jinan to find relatives.

474
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,480
But everywhere was in a mess and people stuck in battlefields.

475
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,640
There are refugees everywhere.

476
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
We couldn't find relatives,

477
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,800
ended up following the big group to Tianjin Wei.

478
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
Are all the refugees from Anhui? 

479
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
No, they are from everywhere.

480
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,040
Shanxi, Henan

481
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
Hebei

482
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,640
Shandong has bad natural disaster this year.

483
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
Most people ran away

484
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
You take it.

485
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,800
Money can't help me now.

486
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,160
Do you have anything to eat? 

487
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,160
Keep it. You can use it.

488
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
You are a good person, sir.

489
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,720
Kid, bowing for the good sir.

490
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,520
Quick, kid.

491
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
They are good man help us.

492
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,640
No, no, no

493
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,280
Good man.

494
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,280
Thank you, nice sir.

495
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,160
My loveed one, my dear son.

496
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,800
I brought you a boat.

497
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
So when you arrived at the other world.

498
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,240
You won't freeze, you won't starve.

499
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
It is northern custom to light up lanterns and let them go down with the river flow.

500
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,040
Pay homage to the dead.

501
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,120
Grandpa.

502
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,520
Grandpa.

503
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,160
That's many lanterns you have here.

504
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,040
There are many friends over in that world.

505
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,840
I can't have them feeling left behind. 

506
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,360
So you are paying homage to friends. 

507
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,120
We were all in the Boxer Rebellion that year.

508
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,840
We went through life-death situation together.

509
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
They've been gone for almost twenty years,

510
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,320
killed by foreigners, died for the country.

511
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,160
They were only young lads

512
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,840
when they lost their lives.

513
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,800
They didn't even have chance to start a family.

514
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm the only one left

515
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,200
I can't leave them alone.

516
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
They died for their country.

517
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,240
It's worth dying for.

518
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,280
Worth a fart.

519
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,760
I sent them these laterns today,

520
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,480
not for homage but for how unfair what happened on them.

521
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,920
Die for a country like this.

522
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,960
They wasted their lives.

523
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Look at this river bank.

524
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,600
Over years,

525
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
three hundred and sixty days a year,

526
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
there is not one day where there is not hundreds of refugees here.

527
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,200
Those starving to death, freezing to death, dying of illness.

528
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Those got dumped on the side of the road and no one would even bother to bury them.

529
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,040
You two look like you are well-educated and knowledgeable.

530
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,480
I want to ask you.

531
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Can such a country still be saved?

532
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Is the government managing it here?

533
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,600
Government?

534
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
I've never seen such an asshole government.

535
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,040
When did they care?

536
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,360
The lives of ordinary people!

537
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,920
When Eight-Nation Alliance came waving their weapons.

538
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,560
In the sea, in the river,

539
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,640
there were dead bodies of Chinese floating everywhere. 

540
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
Some without heads. 

541
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,920
Some limbs incompleted.

542
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,200
Some women naked.

543
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,560
Poor thing!

544
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,680
We peasants are born into hard life.

545
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,520
We got used to it throughout the years.

546
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,240
Shouchang

547
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,880
Shouchang

548
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,640
i figured it out

549
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,560
We have to establish a political party.

550
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,600
We have to have a strong leadership core.

551
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,840
What kind of party do you want to build?

552
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,040
One advanced political party 

553
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
armed with Marxism theory.

554
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,280
One can lead China towards a bright future,

555
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,360
provide Chinese people with a good life.

556
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,600
A political party of the proletariat.

557
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Why do you want to build this political party?

558
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,320
I don't need a reason.

559
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,080
I am doing it for them.

560
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,920
I am doing it for them.

561
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,160
I am doing it for them.

562
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,200
I am doing it so they will be able to live like human being.

563
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,640
So they can have human's rights.

564
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,800
So they can have human's happiness.

565
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
So they can have human's dignity.

566
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,280
Fine, Brother Zhongfu.

567
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,600
We are making vows here today in front of our people.

568
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,600
Come.

569
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's do it.

570
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,120
For people not having their homes taken away.

571
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
For a prosperous life for all the Chinese people.

572
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,680
For a peacful and happy life for all the Chinese people.

573
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
For the poor ones not being bullied and oppressed.

574
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,200
For everyone can be their own master.

575
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,040
For everyone have access to education.

576
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,720
For the youths to be educated and the elders not have to worry about their late life.

577
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,800
For the Chinese people's prosperity and national strength.

578
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,400
For national reconstruction and rejuvenation

579
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,560
I am willing to dedicate my life for it.

580
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,240
I am willing to dedicate my life for it.

581
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:14,480
February 1920, Li Dazhao took the risk helping Chen Duxiu leaving Beijing as Chen was wanted by the police then.

582
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,960
 On the way, they made a promise that they would set up organization for establishing party in Beijing and in Shanghai. 

583
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,440
This is called South Chen and North Li's promise in the beginning of the party.

584
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Brother Shizhi, please sit down.

585
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,120
Sit.

586
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,680
So Chen Duxiu has left Beijing. 

587
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,360
He left that night.

588
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
How did he leave?

589
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm not sure how.

590
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,640
One second.

591
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,040
He left a letter for you.

592
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,360
Director Wu

593
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,120
I thank you for the attention and efforts you had on me.

594
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,480
A few days ago, I received a telegram from a friend.

595
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,120
He invited me to go over for some business in Southwest University.

596
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,480
I had to leave in a hurry and failed to inform you.

597
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,160
Hereby, I am writing this letter as a late note. 

599
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,440
Hope you can understand and forgive me for that.

600
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,760
I will come back to Beijing once I finish business there.

601
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,200
By then I will offer my sincere apology visiting you myself.

602
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,640
Best regards, Chen Duxiu.

603
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,560
This Chen Duxiu is truly an interesting man.

604
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,840
A true friend almost.

605
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
With this letter, none of us will be held accountable

606
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,440
as we are both his sponsors.

607
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,760
Zhongfu has always been a man who values his words and righteousness. 

608
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,120
He also mentioned that

609
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
he will ask the southern government to openly send you an official letter

610
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
in few days.

611
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,960
Rest assured you will not be responsible for any of this.

612
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,560
Fine, it's pointless trying to stop raindrops falling down.

613
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,760
Let it be.

614
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,120
Do you know

615
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't think you can compare Shanghai with Beijing

616
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,520
I don't think you could.

617
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,800
They are so different from each other.

618
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
Like Beijing.

619
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,840
There is sandstorm

620
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,040
I can't handle it.

621
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,080
I really can't.

622
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,600
Can't cope with sandstorm

623
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,280
Shanghai has this wet moments.

624
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,920
These rainy moments.

625
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,200
But to be honest, I really don't like Shanghai.

626
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,960
But Beijing

627
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,080
I will be able to live there.

628
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,400
difference, the weather difference.

629
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,640
This comparsion between these two,

630
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,760
between Beijing and Shanghai

631
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,720
Still very interesting.

632
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,200
I mean

633
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,680
This is a different kind of comparison.

634
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
It's like comparing night with day. 

635
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,440
Thank you very much.

636
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,600
How can you compare it, there is no way to compare it.

637
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,120
Mr. Shouchang.

638
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,880
I'll leave now, please continue your work.

639
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,840
Take care.

640
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,160
Mr. Shouchang.

641
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,720
Runzhi.

642
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,080
You got darker, lost weight.

643
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,720
But you look more energetic.

644
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,760
Good.

645
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,840
Sir.

646
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,080
Thanks to Mrs.Li's two cans of Chili oil.

647
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,040
They arrived just in time.

648
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
Otherwise, I probably couldn't last for any longer.

649
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
I'll ask her to make more for you.

650
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,680
With more chili.

651
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,960
Sure thing.

652
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,920
Come.

653
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,440
Sit, sit.

654
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,080
Here, Runzhi.

655
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,480
Sit down.

656
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,640
Give me a minute.

657
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,640
Runzhi.

658
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,840
How's the Zhang-expelling movement going in Hunan?

659
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,720
Tell me about it.
