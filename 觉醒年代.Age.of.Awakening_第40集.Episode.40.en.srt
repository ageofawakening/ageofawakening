didn't even put my suitcase down,

Professor Chen, you left Beijing without permission.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Then you made a scene in Wuhan.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
Now that you finally came back to Beijing.

I should probably just leave for safety.

85

But I was wondering that if I leave,

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400

I say just ignore him.

90

He can't put you back in jail just for that.

91

Zhongfu, you should pay more attention anyway.

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,160
I read the Wuhan newspaper

98
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,440
and the remarks that appeared in your speech.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,520
You openly publicized communism,

100
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,960
theory of class struggle.

101
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,040
You also mentioned revolution with bloodshed,

102
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
demolishing private ownership.

103
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
These remarks are really out of line.

104
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,480
Of course they would go after you.

105
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
Why can't you learn your lessons?

106
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
Shizhi, is it even meaningful to say this now?

107
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
If you ask me, why not go to the South?

108
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,160
Go to the South and start your fight there.

109
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
The South?

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
Sorry, guys.

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,760
Well, I think I'd better leave Beijing.

118
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,280
Chinese New Year is coming soon.

119
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,440
If something really happens to me,

120
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
everyone is not gonna enjoy and relax during this time.

121
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,360
Brother Zhongfu, where are you going?

122
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,640
I'm thinking accept the offer to teach in Southwest University

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,280
from the Southern Government.

124
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
I want to go to Shanghai first.

125
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,080
The political environment there is better than that in Beijing.

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
Plus the labor and business communities have been exposed to the new ideology for a long time.

127
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Unlike Beijing, all those happened were only in student groups.

128
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
In addition, I also want to bring "New Youth"

129
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,840
to Shanghai,

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,080
if you here will agree with that.

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,560
In Beijing,

132
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,840
especially in Peking University,

133
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
"New Youth" has already built a solid base.

134
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,160
Why start from the beginning in a different place?

135
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
I agree with brother Zhongfu.

136
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,760
The "New Youth" was brought by Zhongfu.

137
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
Naturally, it should follow you.

138
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
"New Youth" is not "New Youth" without Chen Duxiu.

139
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,400
No matter where it goes,

140
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
where it stays,

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
as long as brother Zhongfu is taking care of it,

142
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
we will support as always.

143
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,480
I agree.

144
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,280
I agree.

145
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
Thank you Yucai.

146
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480
Then it's settled.

147
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
I will go to Shanghai by train tomorrow.

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
After arriving in Shanghai,

149
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,640
I'll ask Zhang Shizhao in the name of the Southern Government

150
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
to send an official letter to the Metropolitan Police Department first thing,

151
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
informing them that I accepted the job

152
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
as the organizer of Southwest University.

153
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,480
Then everyone will be out of trouble.

154
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
Besides, after arriving in Shanghai,

155
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,560
I will finish the next issue

156
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,760
of "New Youth".

157
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Things after that, we will discuss another time.

158
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
Sure, it seems like the safest way now.

159
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Director.

160
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
Our people went to Jiangan Hutong again just now.

161
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Chen Duxiu was not home.

162
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,520
Looks like he went to drink with some friends.

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
Drinking?

164
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,400
Who did he go drinking with?

165
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,040
This better not be causing trouble.

166
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,320
Indeed.

167
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,400
I say we just arrest him.

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,760
Come back, come back.

169
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,600
You have to stop this.

170
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,320
Always acting without thinking.

171
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
Think about the grand scheme now.

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
The North-South Peace Period.

173
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,040
I heard that Chen Jiongming even invited him out,

174
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
offering him a job as the organizer of Southwest University.

175
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
If we act rashly at this time,

176
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,280
arrest him,

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
will the Southern Government just sit and do nothing?

178
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,440
Director!

179
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
It's Chinese New Year soon.

180
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,800
Chen Duxiu is a potential danger of public security in Beijing.

181
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
Look at his speech in Wuhan.

182
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
Aggresive and inflammatory.

183
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
That can possibly cause a lot of damage.

184
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,600
I understand what you said.

185
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
You know what?

186
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Send someone to invite him to the hall tomorrow.

187
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,160
Ask him to write a guarantee.

188
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,000
If he agrees to our terms,

189
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,440
then let him go back.

190
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,240
If he doesn't agree, then detain him.

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Make it acceptable for the public.

192
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,680
Tomorrow.

193
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,720
Tomorrow.

194
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,320
Got it.

195
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
I'll arrange it.

196
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,320
Good.

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Zhongfu.

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,080
Mrs. Chen.

199
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,200
You are all here.

200
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,320
Zhongfu.

201
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
The police went to the house to look for you just now.

202
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
I told them

203
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
that you went to a friend's place for a drink.

204
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
They left without saying anything.

205
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,880
But I'm worried

206
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
they might come again later.

207
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,600
I think you should go hide now.

208
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,720
I saw that coming.

209
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

210
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Brother Zhongfu can stay here tonight.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,040
I'll even say Wu Bingxiang

212
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
will not dare to just come here and arrest people.

213
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
Shizhi, Zhongfu can't stay with you.

214
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
You are one of the sponsors.

215
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,040
Wu Bingxiang is likely to come here looking for him.

216
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
I say you stay at my place tonight.

217
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,080
Besides, you can't take the train

218
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
departing from Beijing to Shanghai tomorrow.

219
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
The police will be waiting.

220
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
They won't let you go.

221
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll take you,

222
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
we go to Tianjin and you leave to Shanghai there.

223
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,840
Ok.

224
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
We need to move fast.

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Brother Zhongfu.

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
After today's farewell,

227
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
I don't know when I will see you again.

228
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,680
Wait for me. I'll get the wine.

229
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
Good one, Hua Diao wine.

230
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
The kind you had before.

231
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Deqian, we don't have time now.

232
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,600
I will run, we can make it.

233
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,400
Deqian.

234
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,760
I have Hua Diao at home.

235
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, yeah, Hua Diao wine.

236
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
Can't have it cold.

237
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
Bad for health.

238
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll heat it up.

239
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,720
Don't worry.

240
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Wine might be cold, but our blood is hot.

241
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,640
Come on.

242
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Come.

243
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Guys!

244
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,280
I came to Beijing at the beginning of 1917.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,960
Originally just helping Cai Yuanpei out

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,280
for only three months.

247
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,320
I didn't expect that three months turned into three years.

248
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,680
These three years,

249
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
from starting "New Youth" by myself

250
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
to have so many fellow brothers.

251
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,320
We built a career together.

252
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,560
We set up a banner together.

253
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
I have no regrets and no shame at these past three years.

254
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,320
This cup of wine

255
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
has the respect of all fellow brothers' love for me.

256
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Junman, have it with me.

257
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
Brother Zhongfu, do you still remember a few years ago

258
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,960
when we met each other at Tao Ran Temple?

259
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
How can I forget that?

260
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
You warmed up the wine at home,

261
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,480
you were afraid of it getting cold,

262
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,080
so you wrapped it in a quilt, rented a rickshaw,

263
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,120
and brought it all the way in that freezing day.

264
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
We had hot Hua Diao wine in that snowy winter.

265
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,360
No one will do that again I guess.

266
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
This wine is a little cold today.

267
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,080
Brother Zhongfu, I used my hands to warm it up a little.

268
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,840
Have this one instead.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
This will do.

270
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,640
Now in my chest,

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,600
I have a warm fire lightening up.

272
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,120
You, snow and Hua Diao wine,

273
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,560
isn't this the same as that day?

274
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,360
The same indeed.

275
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
We had our start, now we have our end.

276
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Brother Zhongfu, you are my friend forever.

277
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:43,376
[Qian Xuantong, Modern Chinese thinker, phonetician, philologist, advocate of the New Culture Movement. Died of illness in Beijing in 1939, aged 52.]

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,640
Brother Zhongfu.

279
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
I really have to thank you.

280
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,720
For you made me

281
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
a peer editor of "New Youth".

282
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,160
I gained so much and I felt so cheerful

283
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,640
during this time.

284
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
I should be the one to say thank you.

285
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,560
Since "New Youth" adopted this system

286
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,080
with the peer editors.

287
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,640
Yi Han wrote many important papers

288
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
for our New Youth.

289
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,800
You are one of the most active in promoting

290
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,520
scientific and democratic ideaology.

291
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
You are one crucial member

292
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
of "New Youth".

293
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,760
Cheers.

294
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:26,681
[Gao Yihan, advocate of the May Fourth and New Culture Movement, political scientists. Died of illness in Beijing in 1968, aged 83.]

295
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,720
I am speaking genuinely here.

296
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,680
Without Chen Duxiu pushing Zhou Shuren,

297
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
there wouldn't be the "Diary of a Madman"

298
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
and "Kong Yiji".

299
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
There wouldn't be an author goes by the name Lu Xun.

300
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,640
Brother Zhongfu, truly, thank you.

301
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,640
Yucai, I always thought that

302
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,320
you are the most profound novelist in China.

303
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
You are the one standing at the front and holding the banner of New Culture.

304
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,160
Lu Xun is that person.

305
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:39,700
[Lu Xun, famous writer, thinker, flag bearer of the May Fourth and New Culture Movements, founder of Modern Chinese literature. Died of illness in Shanghai in 1936, aged 55.]

306
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
Brother Zhongfu, we have to move now.

307
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,080
I see.

308
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,640
Well, that's it.

309
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,160
Stay.

310
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
Stay.

311
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Brother Zhongfu, I want to know

312
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
what's your plan after you get there?

313
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,520
I was going to ask you the same question.

314
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,440
You said you planned to start promoting Marxism openly in Peking University,

315
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,400
and encourge laborers and workers to start a new movement

316
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,280
in Changxindian.

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,080
Tell me how you plan to do it.

318
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm starting a few courses in Peking University first.

319
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,920
Socialism and social movements.

320
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,920
Historical materialism.

321
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,080
International movement of workers.

322
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
The future of socialism.

323
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
I also plan to establish a Marxist theory research club

324
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,880
in Peking University.

325
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,960
I also discussed it with Zhongxia.

326
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,680
I want to run night classes for workers in Changxindian.

327
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,280
Organizing workers' movement,

328
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,440
and starting a workers' club.

329
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,040
I believe among all the reasons

330
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,320
why the May Fourth Movement was a success,

331
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,680
a very important one is

332
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
the working class in Shanghai stood out and fought.

333
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,840
Right.

334
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
When I said that the political environment is better in Shanghai than Beijing,

335
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,720
this is why.

336
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,120
According to Marx's theory,

337
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,160
the working class is the pioneer representative of productive forces.

338
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
The working class should be the leading class of the revolutionary movement.

339
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,080
Yes.

340
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,840
Shouchang, what you said is the process,

341
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
have you thought about it?

342
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
What is our ultimate goal?

343
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,920
We left our family, wife and kids.

344
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,400
We left what we have behind and kept hiding.

345
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,840
We might even lose our lifes.

346
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
All these and what are we after for?

347
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
Mom, I'll help you.

348
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,880
Sure.

349
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,880
One, two, three, I'll slow down.

350
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,360
Move.

351
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200
Slow, slow, slow, slow.

352
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,240
What are you doing?

353
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
You just came in without even knocking?

354
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,120
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Chen.

355
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,640
Is Mr. Chen back?

356
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,000
He's not here.

357
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
Where is he?

358
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,240
I don't know.

359
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,960
Where are you going?

360
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
Cleaning up some broken stuff.

361
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,960
Throwing it out.

362
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,840
Not here.

363
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,640
Not here.

364
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,440
Not here.

365
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,480
Mrs. Chen.

366
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,400
If he comes back,

367
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,880
please ask him to go to the Metropolitan Police Department.

368
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,720
There's something important to discuss.

369
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,360
Thank you for your cooperation.

370
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,920
By the way, that is one heavy suitcase.

371
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
Turn around.

372
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,600
March.

373
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,320
Zimei.

374
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,520
Mom.

375
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
Yingying.

376
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,240
Yingying.

377
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,760
Yingying is back.

378
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Yingying! Yingying is back.

379
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,120
Yingying.

380
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,480
Come down.

381
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Come down quickly!

382
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,560
Yingying, come down.

383
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
Yingying, come down.

384
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Yingying, come down.

385
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,480
Yingying, come down.

386
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,360
Yingying, come down.

387
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,794
Yingying, come down.

388
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:34,560
Yingying.

389
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,840
Yingying.

390
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,850
Yingying.

391
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,320
Yingying.

392
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,200
Yingying.

393
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,480
Yingying.

394
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
Yingying.

395
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,440
Yingying.

396
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,120
Recently I've been thinking

397
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,240
that day we had drinks at your place,

398
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
Shizhi asked me something.

399
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
He said that we all have a good life,

400
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,920
we all have some level of achivements.

401
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,800
Why we still choose to leave the wife and children?

402
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,800
What is it that we want?

403
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,760
Brother Zhongfu, I want to ask you

404
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
Have you found your answer?

405
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,560
I think I've figured it out.

406
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
I think I figured it out, too.

407
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,280
Our country

408
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,120
was once created the most splendid civilization

409
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,480
in human history.

410
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
But after the Opium War?

411
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
Our country sank rapidly.

412
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,640
We sunk so fast and so badly,

413
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,560
no one has ever seen something like this happened before.

414
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
In only 80 years,

415
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,240
our country

416
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,560
has become the poorest in the world,

417
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,480
becoming a country with the least dignity.

418
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
Warlords and bandits are laughing and cheering.

419
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,000
People lost their home and everything they had.

420
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
They live miserable lives.

421
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,160
As for you and me,

422
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,120
we are one of the few intellectuals in this country.

423
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
Intellectuals are civilized people.

424
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,880
Civilized people should be and have to be

425
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,560
taking responsibility for our country and people.

426
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,240
It's our duty to lead the people to fight.

427
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
We're going to use what Marx created

428
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,560
the principles of scientific socialism,

429
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
we are to build a soceity,

430
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,400
where we will not be bullied by foreign invaders,

431
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,040
we will not be oppressed by corrupted rulers.

432
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Where everyone can be their own masters,

433
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
everyone can live their lives peacefully

434
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,880
and everyone is equal.

435
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,040
Brother Zhongfu, I believe this is responsibility and duty has been assigned to us.

436
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
It is our obligation in this difficult time.

437
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,320
We can not let it down.

438
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
Well said, Shouchang.

439
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,320
But how can we exactly fulfill that?

440
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
What tools and means do we have?

441
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,480
An organization.

442
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,320
We need an organization to bring people together

443
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,960
and a core leadership to lead the way.

444
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,720
Brother Zhongfu, this matters a lot.

445
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
We should put it on the agenda now.

446
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
It is so important,

447
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
we need to work carefully on that.

448
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,720
What did you say?

449
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,600
He disappeared overnight?

450
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,160
So it's gonna cause trouble afterall.

451
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,360
I think

452
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,040
Chen Duxiu must be hiding in someone's house,

453
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,480
planning to sneak out of Beijing.

454
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,560
You mean he hasn't left yet?

455
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,320
It's snowing so heavily.

456
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,520
How could he get out of town alone?

457
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,320
Impossible.

458
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,360
I suggest,

459
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,280
putting more people at Qianmen Railway Station.

460
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,800
He is likely to escape by train.

461
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,920
You know what?

462
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,040
Take my card.

463
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,520
Grab me Hu Shi.

464
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,920
He is the sponsor, I will ask him.

465
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,720
Yes.

466
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
Gentlemen.

467
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
You both seem well-educated, sir.

468
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,840
Have pity on me.

469
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,880
Please help us, my granddaughter is starving.

470
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,360
You sound like you're from the south.

471
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,680
Fengyang, Anhui

472
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Fengyang.

473
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
Fengyang is a good place.

474
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,120
Places along Huaihe River is famous for being prosperous.

475
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,080
How come there is famine this year?

476
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,600
Famine.

477
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,400
Plague.

478
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,160
Bandits.

479
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,000
Warlords.

480
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,760
It everything but prosperous.

481
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
So we ran away.

482
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
Grandpa.

483
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,160
It's winter in the north now.

484
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,080
Why didn't you go south?

485
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,000
Originally, our family

486
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
were going to Jinan to find relatives.

487
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,480
But everywhere was in a mess and people stuck in battlefields.

488
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,640
There are refugees everywhere.

489
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
We couldn't find relatives,

490
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,800
ended up following the big group to Tianjin Wei.

491
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
Are all the refugees from Anhui?

492
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
No, they are from everywhere.

493
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,040
Hebei, Shanxi, Shangdong,

494
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
Hebei, Anfu.

495
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,640
Shandong had bad natural disasters this year.

496
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
Most people ran away.

497
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
You take it.

498
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,800
Money can't help me now.

499
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,160
Do you have anything to eat?

500
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,160
Keep it. You can use it.

501
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
You are a good person, sir.

502
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,520
Kid, bow to the gentlemen.

503
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
They are good people helping us.

504
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,640
No, no, no.

505
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,280
Good man.

506
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,280
Thank you, nice sir.

507
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,160
My loved one, my dear son.

508
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,800
I brought you a boat.

509
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
So when you arrived at the other world.

510
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,240
You won't freeze, you won't starve.

511
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
It is northern custom to light up lanterns and let them go down with the river flow.

512
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,040
Pay homage to the dead.

513
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,120
Grandpa.

514
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,520
Grandpa.

515
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,160
That's many lanterns you have here.

516
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,040
There are many friends over in that world.

517
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,840
I can't have them feeling left behind.

518
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,360
So you are paying homage to friends.

519
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,120
We were all in the Boxer Rebellion that year,

520
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,840
going through a life-death situation together.

521
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
They've been gone for almost twenty years,

522
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,320
killed by foreigners, died for the country.

523
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,160
They were only young lads

524
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,840
when they lost their lives.

525
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,800
They didn't even have chance to start a family.

526
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm the only one left.

527
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,200
I can't leave them alone.

528
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
They died for their country.

529
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,240
It's worth dying for.

530
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,280
Worth a fart.

531
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,760
I sent them these laterns today,

532
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,480
not for homage but for how unfair what happened on them.

533
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,920
Die for a country like this.

534
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,960
They wasted their lives.

535
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Look at this river bank.

536
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,600
Over years,

537
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
three hundred and sixty days a year,

538
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
there is not one day where there is not hundreds of refugees here.

539
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,200
Those starving to death, freezing to death, dying of illness.

540
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Those got dumped on the side of the road and no one would even bother to bury them.

541
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,040
You two look like you are well-educated and knowledgeable.

542
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,480
I want to ask you.

543
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Can such a country still be saved?

544
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Is the government managing it here?

545
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,600
Government?

546
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
I've never seen such an asshole government.

547
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,040
When did they care?

548
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,360
The lives of ordinary people!

549
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,920
When Eight-Nation Alliance came waving their weapons.

550
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,560
In the sea, in the river,

551
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,640
there were dead bodies of Chinese floating everywhere.

552
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
Some without heads.

553
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,920
Some limbs incompleted.

554
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,200
Some women naked.

555
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,560
Poor thing!

556
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,680
We peasants are born into hard life.

557
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,520
After so many years, we've become numb.

558
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,240
Shouchang.

559
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,880
Shouchang.

560
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,640
I figured it out.

561
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,560
We have to establish a political party.

562
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,600
We have to have a strong leadership core.

563
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,840
What kind of party do you want to build?

564
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,040
An advanced political party

565
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
armed with Marxism theory.

566
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,280
One that can lead China towards a bright future,

567
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,360
provide Chinese people with a good life.

568
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,600
A political party of the proletariat.

569
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Why do you want to build this political party?

570
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,320
I don't need a reason.

571
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,080
I am doing it for them.

572
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,920
I am doing it for them.

573
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,160
I am doing it for them.

574
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,200
I am doing it so they will be able to live like human beings.

575
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,640
So they can have human rights,

576
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,800
human happiness,

577
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
human dignity.

578
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,280
Fine, Brother Zhongfu.

579
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,600
We are making vows here today in front of our people.

580
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,600
Come.

581
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's do it.

582
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,120
For people not having their homes taken away.

583
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
For a prosperous life for all the Chinese people.

584
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,680
For a peaceful and happy life for all the Chinese people.

585
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
For the poor ones not being bullied and oppressed.

586
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,200
For everyone can be their own masters.

587
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,040
For everyone have access to education.

588
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,720
For the youths to be educated and the elders not have to worry about their late life.

589
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,800
For the Chinese people's prosperity and national strength.

590
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,400
For national reconstruction and rejuvenation.

591
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,560
I am willing to dedicate my life for it.

592
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,240
I am willing to dedicate my life for it.

593
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:22,000
[February 1920, Li Dazhao took the risk helping Chen Duxiu leaving Beijing as Chen was wanted by the police then. On the way, they made a promise that they would set up an organization to establish a party in Beijing and in Shanghai. This is called South Chen and North Li's promise in the beginning of the party.]

594

[Beijing Metropolitan Police Station]

595
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Brother Shizhi, please sit down.

596
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,120
Sit.

597
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,680
So Chen Duxiu has left Beijing.

598
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,360
He left that night.

599
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
How did he leave?

600
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm not sure how.

601
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,640
One second.

602
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,040
He left a letter for you.

603
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,360
Director Wu.

604
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,120
I thank you for the attention and efforts you had on me.

605
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,480
A few days ago, I received a telegram from a friend.

606
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,120
He invited me to go over for some business in Southwest University.

607
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,480
I had to leave in a hurry and failed to inform you.

608
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm sorry.

609
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,160
Hereby, I am writing this letter as a late note.

610
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,440
Hope you can understand and forgive me for that.

611
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,760
I will come back to Beijing once I finish business there.

612
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,200
By then I will offer my sincere apology visiting you myself.

613
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,640
Best regards, Chen Duxiu.

614
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,560
This Chen Duxiu is truly an interesting man.

615
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,840
A true friend almost.

616
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
With this letter, none of us will be held accountable

617
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,440
as we are both his sponsors.

618
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,760
Zhongfu has always been a man who values his words and righteousness.

619
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,120
He also mentioned that

620
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
he will ask the Southern Government to openly send you an official letter

621
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
in few days.

622
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,960
Rest assured you will not be responsible for any of this.

623
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,560
Fine, it's pointless trying to stop raindrops falling down.

624
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,760
Let it be.

625
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,120
Do you know.

626
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't think you can compare Shanghai with Beijing.

627
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,520
I don't think you could.

628
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,800
They are so different from each other.

629
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
Like Beijing.

630
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,840
The sandstorms.

631
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,040
I can't handle it.

632
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,080
I really can't.

633
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,600
I can't cope with sandstorm.

634
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,280
Shanghai has these wet moments.

635
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,920
It has some unique moments also.

636
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,200
But to be honest, I really don't like Shanghai.

637
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,960
But Beijing,

638
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,080
I wanna be able to live there, to be honest with you.

639
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,400
The difference, the weather difference.

640
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,640
Also it's quite interesting, the comparison between the two.

641
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,760
You know what I mean?

642
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,720
It's like a

643
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,200
different

644
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,680
kind of comparison.

645
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
Like night and day.

646
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,440
Thank you very much.

647
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,600
How can you compare it, there is no way to compare that.

You got darker, lost weight.

655

But you look more energetic.

They arrived just in time.

660
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
Otherwise, I probably couldn't last for any longer.

661
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
I'll ask her to make more for you.
