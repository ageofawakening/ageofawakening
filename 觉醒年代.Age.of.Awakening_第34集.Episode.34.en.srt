"Laboratory and Prison"

7
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,880
There are two locations where civilization in the world began.

8
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,880
The first is a scientific laboratory.

9
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
The second is prison.

10
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,120
Our youth aspire that

11
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,880
if it's not the laboratory where they are, then it should be the prison.

12
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
And it works the other way too.

13
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,440
This is the most noble and beautiful way of life.

14
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,960
Civilization born in these two places is the true civilization.

15
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
It is a civilization that is both alive and valuable.

16
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,040
Fellow citizens,

17
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,280
now everyone in this country has stood up.

18
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,160
Just yesterday

19
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,840
in Shanghai and Tianjin

20
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
students went on a general strike,

21
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,280
workers went on a general strike,

22
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
businesses went on a general strike.

23
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,720
Many firms in Shanghai have also made their voices heared that

24
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
they are willing to stop their business to save the arrested students,

25
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
and they swear not to reopen the market until those traitors are punished.

26
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,960
Right now,

27
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,200
petition groups organized by Beijing Federation of Students

28
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
have arrived at the Presidential Palace.

29
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
We have put forward three demands.

30
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
First, punish the traitors.

31
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Second, do not sign the peace treaty.

32
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,480
Third,

33
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,680
we will never recognize Hu Renyuan as the President of Peking University.

34
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,360
We pledge that

35
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,480
we will never leave until the government fulfills all three demands.

36
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,520
Good!

37
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
No mercy towards the traitors!

38
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
Give me back Qingdao and my freedom!

39
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
Punish the traitors!

40
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,880
Give me back Qingdao and my freedom!

41

47
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
aroused great indignation among the people.

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,520
From the beginning of June,

49
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,480
tens of thousands of teachers and students from dozens of schools in Beijing

50
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
took to the streets

51
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,960

all went on strikes

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
to support the student movement.

56
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,760
In Shanghai, Tianjin, Jinan, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places,

57
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
there were also massive eruptions

58
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,400
as people went on strike together.

Let's talk about Shanghai first.

75
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,320
This afternoon, in Shanghai,

76
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
people went on strike as schools, markets and labour are all involoved.

77
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,800
The community in Shanghai held a joint meeting

78

81
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,640
They sent a telegram to the whole country,

82
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
declaring that one more day the traitors remain unpunished,

83
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720

92
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,760

This is unprecedented.

94
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
More importantly,

95
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
the southern government is using this situation

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,520
to win over people's hearts,

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040

98

Even some foreign banks and trading companies

99

have asked us to keep the situation under control as soon as possible,

100
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,400
so to protect the interests of foreign businessmen.

101

There was a workers' parade in Changxindian.

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160

It is imperative that we can control the situation.

111
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,840
We have to win over students' hearts at all costs.

112
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
Is there a way to do this considering what we have done?

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
There are ways.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,680
That's why you two are here now.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
But,

116
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,000
it all comes to you two to do this.

117
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,520
Please instruct us.

118
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,800
Duan Shuai said that

119
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,880
as we are in the middle of negotiation with the southern government now,

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,480
considering that the southern government is using

121
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
this mess caused by students

122
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,200
as an excuse to attack us.

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,720
We can't lose big over an insignificant matter like this.

124
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,960
We can't lose to them and to the people at the same time.

125
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
So, by all means, we have to keep things in Beijing under control.

126
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,480
So, what, Duan is giving in?

127
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,480
That's not like him.

128
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,080
It's not giving in.

129
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,320
It's strategy, tactics.

130
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,160
Cut the nonsense.

131
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,000
What's the trick? Come on.

132
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,320
By presidential decree,

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
Wang Huaiqing is removed from his duty as the Army Chief.

134
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,160
Duan Zhigui is removed from his duty as Commander.

135
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
All infantry, soldiers and others shall be evacuated.

136
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
Public security in Beijing

137
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,760
will be handed over to the Metropolitan Police Department.

Signed, Xu Shichang.

139
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,480
This is us taking a step back.

140
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,840
I see.

141
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
So that's why it's only me here today.

142
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
Turns out those two are let go

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
just in these few days.

144
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,160
Wait.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
Without the troops, how can I manage all those students

146
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
only using the police force?

147
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Director Wu, if you have any complaints,

148
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
please send it to your master Duan Qirui.

149
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm just here to convey the order.

150
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,800
If you still want to come to the meeting tomorrow,

151
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,000
just go and do your job.

152
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,520
I'm not complaining.

153
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,960
I just want to know,

154
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,800
with the troops withdrawn, the gendarmerie withdrawn,

155
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,800
what good can us police do?

156
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,000
Maintain order.

157
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
Wait for the order to evacuate.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
Fine, fine.

159
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,280
Minister Fu,

160
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,920
you are to consult with the principals of each school as soon as possible

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
on the aftermath of police evacuation.

162
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
The government has only one condition.

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
Students are to resume classes immediately.

164
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
As soon as the arrested students are released,

165
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
I will be on it.

166
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,160
But the government has to promise that

167
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,160
the military police must not meddle with the students affair again.

168
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
The students affair only gets more complicated

169
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,400
when the police got involved.

170
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Do you think I really care for this shitshow?

171
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,080
Your lack of management is why

172
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
a bunch of scholars can push the students into causing trouble.

173
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,240
If it weren't for that,

174
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,440
my life would be a lot easier.

175
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,480
Enough!

176
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,160
Does arguing work?

177
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
Director Wu,

178
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
you need to convey

179
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,480
the dismissal order of those two.

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,440
Very well.

181
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Wait a second.

182
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
This is your job. Why should I go?

183
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
This is the instruction from General Duan and the President.

184
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
Weigh that yourself.

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
Fine, I'm going.

186
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,760
Director Wu, I am leaving to work too.

Decree of the President of the Republic of China.

188
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
First, all arrested students

189
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
are released immediately.

190
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Second, police will retreat unconditionally.

191
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
All personnel will withdraw from along the Beiheyan Avenue and the Horse God Temple.

192
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,560
Third, the Ministry of Education will be responsible for public security.

193

194
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,200
Open the door.

195
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,440
What's going on?

196
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
Students, students.

197
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400
You must calm down.

198
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
Come out and talk to us if you have something to say.

199
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,280
After collective discussion, all our students

200
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,440
determined to never leave prison!

201
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,560
Never leave prison!

202
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,798
Classmates!

203
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,280
Classmates, please be quiet!

204
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,600
Here is a telegram from the Beijing Student Union.

205
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
It's sent to the whole country.

206
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,000
I am here to read it out.

207
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,640
The government has made a fool of itself.

208
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,920
Students are detained for no reason,

209
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,520
and cannot leave by themselves.

210
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
The military police ravaged schools, undermined justice,

211
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,560
violated human rights, abandoned their humanity.

212
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
If this is tolerated, how can we serve the country?

213
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
Serve the country! Never leave prison!

214
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
Serve the country! Never leave prison!

215
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Tell me what you want,

216
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,200
so that the students can come out.

217
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
Please be more specific.

218
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,440
I'll go back and ask my superiors for instructions.

219
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,800
Dismiss the traitors

220
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,560
Zhang Zongxiang, Cao Rulin, Lu Zongyu.

221
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,400
Okay, okay, no problem.

222
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
I'll ask my superiors for instructions right away.

223
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
Yes, victory is in sight.

224
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,560
Hang in there. Yeah!

225
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,280
Come on, come on!

226
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,080
Come on!

227
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,480
Come on!

228
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,560
Now students' demands are

229
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,760
the removal of

230
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,800
Cao Rulin,

231
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,920
Zhang Zongxiang,

232
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
Lu Zongyu.

233
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,640
This is also their bottom line.

234
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,680
Otherwise, it will be difficult to convince them.

235
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Students push their luck.

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
Explain that there must be someone behind them.

237
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,360
Let's talk about it. What should we do?

238
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,840
I'll speak first.

239
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,760
I have received today

240
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,600
four telegrams from Chief Lu from Paris.

241
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:14,026
[Xu Shichang, pen name Juren, President of the Republic of China]

242
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,800
He said that

243
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,400
the residence of the Chinese delegation in Paris

244
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,520
has been surrounded,

245
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
and the local Chinese have suggested

246
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,120
that if the government can detain patriotic students,

247
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,240
then they can follow that example

248
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,360
and detain Chinese envoys.

249
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,280
If we don't release the students,

250
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,560
the delegation

251
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
will be likely treated as traitors

252
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,920
and attacked by the local Chinese.

253
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
I studied the students' demands carefully.

254
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,640
They're not really high.

255
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
After all, the Paris Peace Treaty was not brought out.

256
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,560
In the end,

257
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,960
it's nothing more than to remove Cao, Zhang, and Lu

258
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,640
and give the nation a chance to express its anger.

259
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
I think we can't lose this big event

260
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,680
because of these few people.

261
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,600
It's time to make up your mind.

262
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
If we continue to delay,

263
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,200
the students will make other demands.

264
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,400
That would be troublesome.

265
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,520
I agree with Premier Qian's opinion.

266
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,440
I agree with Premier Qian's opinion.

267
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
I agree with Premier Qian's opinion.

268
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,040
I agree. I agree.

269
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,920
I also agree with the Premier's opinion.

270
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
Director Wu, what's your opinion?

271
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,880
At this point,

272
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,240
what else can I say?

273
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
I'll just carry out your decision.

274
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,880
Good. Director Wu's attitude is very good.

275
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
Now everyone is in agreement.

276
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,280
I also discussed this matter with Old Duan.

277
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,400
Now it's here again.

278
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,640
It's really time to get past this hurdle.

279
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,560
I have to condescend to

280
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,080
Cao Rulin and the others first.

281
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,160
So please ask Acting Minister Fu

282
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,320
to formally apologize to the students on my behalf.

283
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,040
At the same time, a formal order will be issued to remove

284
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
Cao, Zhang, and Lu from their positions.

285
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,040
Yes.

287
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,640
Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, and Lu Zongyu are dismissed.

288
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,520
Cao Rulin has also resigned from his position

289
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,520
as manager of the Bank of Communications.

Gentlemen,

298
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,000
originally,

299
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,560
I thought Peking University was going to die this time. Really.

300
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
But I didn't expect it to come back to life.

301
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,000
Therefore, everything

302
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,040
requires you to persist

303
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
and persist in your efforts.

304
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,560
I'm not as optimistic as you.

305
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,720
Now it's just a staged victory.

306
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
Master Cai hasn't come back yet.

307
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
There will be more torment at the back.

308
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,200

It will never stop.

312
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
Fortunately, there is already hope.

Mr. Shizhi, which is the most important priority for Peking University:

344

patriotism or attending classes?

345
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,880
Patriotism is not contradictory to class attendance.

346
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,200

00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,160
after boycotting the Paris Peace Treaty

370
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,840
if a country's

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,280
problem is not solved at all,

372
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,480
similar problems will also

373
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,760
come out one by one.

374
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,200
It is also empty talk to strengthen the country and enrich the people.

375
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
What's wrong now

376
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
is this rotten regime.

377
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Then my point is clear.

378
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,560
Fight, we must fight to the end.

379
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,440
I still have the same old argument.

380
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,360
I don't advocate violent revolution.

381
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,640
I don't advocate talking about socialism all the time.

382
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,240
We should be practical.

383
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
Speaking of learning from foreign countries,

384
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
my opinion is to learn from the United States.

385
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
Everyone, don't forget,

386
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,360
our New Culture Movement,

387
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
our banner is science and democracy.

388
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,040
So China must learn from the United States

389
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,040
in all aspects to develop.

390
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,400
Deqian,

391
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,800
didn't you tell me the other day,

392
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
that you think Shizhi has some foreign worship?

393
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,320
Why don't you talk about it?

394
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
So-called democracy is to express one's own opinion.

395
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Don't hide it.

396
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,960
I wanted to publish it.

397
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,040
But I really haven't organized it yet.

398
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,560
Shizhi.

399
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,440
Worshiping foreign things, not ingratiating myself.

400
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,280
Not ingratiating yourself?

401
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
Excuse me, Dr. Hu,

402
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,400
these days

403
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,680
you follow Professor Dewey's ass

404
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,600
with a bag in your hand every day

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
like a sidekick. Isn't that flattering?

406
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Shizhi, I know a person who is particularly like you.

407
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,160
Who?

408
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,560
That old queue beside Gu Hongming, Liu Er.

409
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,800
Yes or no?

410
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,680
Bannong, I say this because

411
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
I think we can all express our own opinions.

412
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,280
However, we express our views in order to find the direction.

413
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,400
As for the different views and familiarity,

414
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,000
it is different depending on the country and the times.

415
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,000
A gentleman's harmony is different.

416
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,280
This harmony is what we have in common now.

417
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
What do we have in common?

418
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,240
I think that is no matter what,

419
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,280
we should transform the current society.

420
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
It is a transformation, not an improvement.

421
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,600
It's a revolution.

422
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,560
This is because I have come to a conclusion

423
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
after seeing all the perverse practices

424
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,120
of the Beiyang government.

425
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
And I want to tell you,

426
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,240
since we have launched such a campaign

427
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
at this critical moment,

428
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,720
we should stand up bravely

429
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,520
and act directly.

430
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
This is also the responsibility of those of us

431
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,800
who are awakened in the present.

432
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,280
I have no dress, I share it with my fellows.

433
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
I will work with you.

434
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,080
I count myself in.

435
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,560
Shouchang,

436
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,160
I have a worry.

437
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,520
What?

438
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,000
Worried about the split of our "New Youth".

439
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,400
Now we quarrel almost as soon as we meet.

440
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,640
I know what you mean.

441
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,560
Shizhi has too much faith about the United States.

442
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
Too much faith in Dewey's experimentalism.

443
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,560
Actually, he doesn't think about it.

444
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
How can China's feudal system for thousands of years

445
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
be changed by talking and writing?

446
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
If there is no big revolution,

447
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
China can't catch up with the world trend.

448
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
I used to think that you two

449
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,240
are too radical.

450
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
Shizhi? He's too moderate.

451
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,520
I choose between you two.

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But now I think

453
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
I have more inclinations.

454
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,560
This is bound to make Shizhi feel more isolated.

455
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,800
Shouchang, let me remind you,

456
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,720
Shizhi is very respectful.

457
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,440
Don't be too hard on him on some occasions.

458
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,160
There are some things I tell him about,

459
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,520
and he can barely get by.

460
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
You talk too much, it's hard for his face.

461
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,040
You can rest assured,

462
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,880
I didn't treat him as an outsider.

463
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
What do you mean by inclination just now?

464
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,280
About Marxism.

465
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
A while ago, I was compiling the manuscript

466
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,120
of the next issue of "New Youth".

467
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
I put the long article you wrote

468
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
"My View of Marxism"

469
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,720
and read it again carefully.

470
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,680
At the same time, on 6 April

471
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,120
I published in the "Weekly Review"

472
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
second chapter of the "Communist Manifesto",

473
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
"Proletarians and Communists".

474
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,640
I also read it carefully.

475
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,840
It was very touching and I felt a lot.

476
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,840
You said in the editor's note

477
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
of the "Communist Manifesto"

478
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,800
that this is Marx's and Engels's

479
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
first and foremost opinion.

480
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,160
This is a great inspiration to me.

481
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,680
Shouchang, I think you are now

482
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
the first person in China

483
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
to advocate and believe in Marxism.

484
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,320
So I need to ask you something.

485
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,760
Don't be afraid to ask for advice.

486
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Actually, when I was in Japan,

487
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
I've been paying attention to Marxist theory.

488
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm writing now

489
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,320
the second half of

490
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,040
"My View of Marxism".

491
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,120
But I really want to know

492
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,080
your views and opinions on the first half.

493
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,800
At least now I think

494
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,280
Marxism is more reasonable

495
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,120
than anarchism.

496
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
It is more rational than Dewey's experimentalism.

497
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,160
But as to whether it is

498
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
the most advanced theoretical system of our time,

499
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,120
it's hard to say.

500
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,640
Because I didn't read

501
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,200
all of Marx's works.

502
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,920
In fact, I have been concerned

503
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,760
about Marxist theory for many years.

504
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,040
I found out when I was in Japan before.

505
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,200
There are many people studying Marx's

506
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
socialist theory in Japan

507
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,400
and translated a lot of materials.

508
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
Originally, I just read its principles.

509
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,200
Such as historical materialism,

510
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,640
dialectical materialism,

511
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,840
socialism from utopian to scientific.

512
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,680
But recently,

513
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,920
I will combine it with the reality of China to read it.

514
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,720
The more I read, the more I feel open.

515
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Brother Zhongfu, I have an idea,

516
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,960
if China wants to develop

517
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,200
we must rely on Marxist theory

518
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,720
to be our guiding ideology.

519
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,360
Besides, it's hard to find a second way.

520
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,280
Are you so sure of your conclusion?

521
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,360
This is just my preliminary idea.

522
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,360
But after the May Fourth Movement,

523
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,080
my belief is getting stronger and stronger.

524
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,080
Of course, it also needs to be demonstrated and considered.

525
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
So what do you think

526
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
about the Russian October Revolution?

527
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,720
This question,

528
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
I have published before

529
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,680
in the "Comparative View of French-Russian Revolutions"

530
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,720
and explained it.

531
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
In general,

532
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,480
the Russian October Revolution

533
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,720
is completely different from the British and French revolutions.

534
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,280
I think it is the most advanced revolution.

535
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
How do you say this?

536
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,360
In the final analysis, the British and French revolutions of the past

537
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,520
are also bourgeois revolutions.

538
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
But the October Revolution in Russia was different.

539
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,840
It is a proletarian-led

540
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
socialist revolution.

541
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,800
According to Marxist theory,

542
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
socialist revolution

543
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
is the inevitable result of the development of capitalism.

544
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,280
In this sense,

545
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
it must be the most progressive revolution.

546
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
I don't read many books of Marx.

547
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,480
But I know

548
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,040
a basic viewpoint of socialist theory

549
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,000
is that socialist revolution breaks out

550
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,360
only after capitalism

551
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,480
has fully developed.

552
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,160
But now Russia

553
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,400
is not a developed capitalist country.

554
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,560
I didn't know this at first.

555
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
But then I read Lenin's book

556
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,320
and I realized.

557
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,680
Lenin has a point of view

558
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,360
that socialist revolution

559
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,200
can break out and succeed

560
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,040
in the weaknesses

561
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
of imperialism.

562
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,480
Look at the Russian October Revolution.

563
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,320
It's been almost two years now.

564
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,520
The Soviet government

565
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
is surrounded by layers of imperialism

566
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
and has gained a firm foothold.

567
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
This is enough to illustrate that Lenin's point of view

568
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,760
is correct.

569
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,880
So you're saying

570
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,920
a poor and weak country like China

571
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,480
can also have a socialist revolution?

572
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,080
I'm still studying this point.

573
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
However, the October Revolution in Russia

574
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
has set an example for us.

575
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,800
Well, Shouchang,

576
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,320
you taught me a lesson today.

577
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,840
Junman!

578
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,520
You're back!

579
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,320
Dad.

580
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,040
What are you doing here?

581
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,080
I'm taking her out.

582
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,600
Sir.

583
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,880
We'll have dinner soon.

584
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,000
Add a few more dishes.

585
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm going to invite Shouchang and Shizhi to dinner tonight.

586
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,200
Okay.

587
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,720
Smells good.

588
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,560
Sister-in-law.

589
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,280
Here. Here.

590
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm eating Anhui cuisine again.

591
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,840
Strictly speaking, this is not Anhui cuisine.

592
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,400
Anhui cuisine refers to Huizhou cuisine.

593
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,160
This should be Wan cuisine

594
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,360
or Anqing cuisine.

595
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,480
Then enjoy your meal.

596
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,920
I will take the children out to dinner.

597
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,040
Thanks, sister-in-law.

598
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,600
Don't mention it.

599
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,280
Here comes the wine. Hello, gentlemen.

600
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This is General Zou Yongcheng's

601
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,160
two jars of old wine brought to me by my client.

602
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
He said they've been staying there for a long time.

603
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,880
Today, we will open them.

604
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,360
Great.

605
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,240
Brother Shouchang,

606
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm willing to come to Zhongfu for dinner.

607
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,120
Look at so many good dishes.

608
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,960
Old wine has also been brought out for us.

609
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,120
When I was as old as Yannian,

610
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
I already had a lot of children.

611
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
Yannian has the Six No's, no drinking.

612
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,120
I won't force him.

613
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
But I ask him to pour wine for the two uncles.

614
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
It's my respect for you both.

615
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
Brother Zhongfu, what are you doing?

616
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,200
No, no.

617
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,840
It's nothing.

618
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,400
The students were released.

619
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,480
Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, Lu Zongyu,

620
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm glad they're all dismissed.

621
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,400
I want to drink some wine.

622
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,760
Come on, gentlemen.

623
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,400
Let me propose a toast to you first.

624
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,520
Cheers.

625
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,720
Good.

626
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
Henian.

627
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,080
Time to eat.

628
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,240
Time to eat, Henian.

629
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,773
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

630
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
Mom, they are eating fish.

631
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,400
We have meat. Meat is better than fish.

632
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,040
Here, Mom will give you a piece of meat.

633
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
Why can't I go?

634
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,400
It's too personal.

635
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,120
When you're eighteen next year,

636
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,320
you can go to the table.

637
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,040
The old man is also the leader of the New Culture Movement,

638
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
engaging in these feudal ethical codes at home.

639
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,320
I protest.

640
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,200
I also protest.

641
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,440
Why don't you let me be with Yannian?

642
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
I also protest against the feudalism of the old man.

643
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,480
Keep your voice down.

644
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,920
Why are you so rude?

645
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,280
Eat some meat.

646
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,560
Stop protesting, go and eat meat.

647
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,440
Delicious?

648
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,000
You all know.

649
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,760
I was in shock the other day.

650
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
Sort of

651
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
experienced a transformation.

652
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,960
Brother Zhongfu, don't worry too much.

653
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,720
It's all in the past.

654
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,840
Now isn't our Peking University

655
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,960
Peking University again?

656
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
Is Peking University the original Peking University?

657
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
I don't know.

658
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,720
I, Chen Duxiu,

659
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,320
am not the original Chen Duxiu anymore.

660
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,560
This is an article I wrote yesterday.

661
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,680
Yannian.

662
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,800
Read it to the two uncles.

663
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
"Beijing Citizen Manifesto"

664
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,400
The Chinese nation is a nation that loves peace.

665
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,520
Today, despite the unbearable internal and external oppression,

666
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,960
we still put forward

667
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,600
the final minimum demands for the government.

668
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,840
First, regarding diplomacy towards Japan,

669
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
we must not abandon the economic rights of Shandong Province

670
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,240
and must cancel two secret agreements in four years and seven years of the Republic of China.

671
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
Second, expel Xu Shuzheng, Cao Rulin

672
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,680
Lu Zongyu, Zhang Zongxiang, Duan Zhigui

673
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,880
Wang Huaiqing and others

674
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,640
from Beijing.

675
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
Third, dismiss the Nine Gates Infantry Commander

676
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,680
and the garrison commander.

677
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,960
Fourth, the Beijing security troops will be organized by citizens.

678
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
Five, citizens must have

679
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
absolute freedom of assembly and speech.

680
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
I still hope that the people can achieve this goal by peaceful means.

681
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,600
The government is still unwilling to make peace

682
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,680
and completely disobeys the wishes of the citizens.

683
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,920
We, students, businessmen, laborers,

684
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,760
soldiers and others have no choice but to take direct action

685
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,440
to make fundamental changes.

686
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,560
We hereby declare

687
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,880
that we sincerely hope that people at home and abroad will understand our declaration.

688
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,080
Brother Zhongfu, what does this mean?

689
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,560
This is what I'm talking about.

690
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,800
We should stand up bravely.

691
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
I have three points to explain.

692
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,120
First, I totally agree with Shouchang.

693
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,920
Expand the student movement into

694
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,800
social movements and mass movements.

695
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,720
Second, make our demands clear for the next step.

696
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,960
Third, publicly declare

697
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,600
that if the government doesn't respect public opinion,

698
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
we will take direct action

699
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
in order to realize the fundamental transformation of society.

700
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,960
And today?

701
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,400
I just want to ask the opinions of you three.

702
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,640
And I also want Shizhi to translate it into English.

703
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,800
Brother Zhongfu, that's great.

704
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,760
Mobilize the public to publish widely.

705
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,320
Yannian, you print more.

706
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,320
Give it to me after printing, and I'll distribute it myself.

707
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,040
Okay.

708
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,320
Brother Shouchang,

709
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
you are an open young professor of Peking University

710
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
handing out leaflets on the street.

711
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,840
What a scandal!

712
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,320
No, Shizhi.

713
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,600
I've never thought of myself

714
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,040
as superior to others.

715
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Look, for the national interest,

716
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,560
people can go to the streets, workers can go to the streets,

717
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,080
women can go to the streets.

718
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,600
What can't I do on the streets?

719
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,880
Don't you tell people about equality and freedom every day?

720
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,800
How come I can't do it here?

721
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
Shizhi, I think you are

722
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,560
a new culture on the outside

723
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
but an old morality on the inside.

724
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,560
It's not the same on the inside.

725
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,360
Shouchang, I've always respected you.

726
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,200
An iron man in culture.

727
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,120
But I really don't understand.

728
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,360
You and brother Zhongfu

729
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,280
are all men of culture.

730
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,280
What are we going to talk about?

731
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,960
A man of culture is a scholar.

732
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,480
The scholar is concerned

733
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,560
with the cultivation of the body, the family, the country and the world

734
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,000
to have a sense of family and country, to cultivate Qi and maintain peace.

735
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,800
Now we have been doing self-cultivation.

736
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
Family. Is our family all together?

737
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,720
The two of you have come a long way

738
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,160
from poverty to now.

739
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,440
And now?

740
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
A Lu Bu among men, a red hare (=ideal horse) among horses.

741
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,920
But why do you have to ruin your future?

742
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,760
Even at the expense of your wife and children?

743
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
I really don't know what you are doing.

744
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:33,115
Shizhi.

745
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,400
Actually, that's a good question.

746
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
Now let me answer you.

747
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,760
I don't think people can live for themselves.

748
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,640
Go to Changxindian

749
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,560
and look at those dilapidated sheds.

750
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,800
Go to Jinpu Railway Line and see

751
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
the thousands of miles of hungry refugees.

752
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
Go to Qianmen Avenue again

753
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,760
and look at those beggars begging along the street.

754
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Shouldn't we do something for them?

755
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,160
Do you expect us to be like you?

756
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,520
Clean and shiny?

757
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,000
Mr. Dazhao.

758
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,600
I think what you said is excellent.

759
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,400
The country should throw caution to the wind at this point.

760
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,440
Give up the few, to save the many.

761
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,120
You can't have it both ways.

762
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,080
Yannian, do you have anything to say?

763
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,040
Brother Zhongfu, it's fine.

764
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,120
Yannian can express his opinion.

765
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,920
Sorry, Uncle Hu.

766
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,720
Shizhi,

767
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,360
I was a little harsh just now.

768
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,880
Sorry.

769
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,080
Not a problem.

770
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,640
It really doesn't matter.

771
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,560
I know you are an open-minded person.

772
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,120
Sit down, gentlemen.

773
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,200
You all know I like to debate.

774
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,960
Only by debating can the truth come out.

775
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,440
Let's raise our glasses.

776
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,240
Here.

777
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,280
Shizhi. Shizhi.

778
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,440
No, this isn't like you.

779
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,520
You don't have to hide it.

780
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,280
Tell me what you think.

781
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm not hiding anything.

782
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,120
I think

783
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,960
brother Zhongfu wanting to make this civic declaration

784
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,400
is unnecessary.

785
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,760
Besides, Mr. Dewey has just arrived in China,

786
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,280
just entered Beijing.

787
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,000
So every day I'm busy arranging

788
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,200
the speech for him.

789
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,680
I need to talk to the Ministry of Education about all these things

790
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,360
and some government departments

791
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,120
and ask them to come forward and arrange these things in person.

792
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,600
I don't want to make these relationships too rigid.

793
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
Mobilize the citizens for democracy. I agree.

794
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
I also agree with the five points mentioned,

795
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,720
especially the fifth one.

796
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,720
But what it says here,

797
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,840
"We, students, businessmen, laborers, soldiers, and others

798
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,440
have no choice but to take direct action",

799
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,760
it's not necessary to be so tough.

800
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,480
Shizhi, why is this unnecessary?

801
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,960
This sentence is the most important, it cannot be put aside.

802
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,360
Shizhi, let me explain.

803
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,840
From the New Cultural Movement to the May Fourth Movement,

804
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,840
this is a causal relationship.

805
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
The former is ideological enlightenment.

806
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
The latter is puts it into action.

807
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,320
Whether you like it or not

808
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,400
these are the results of the direct promotion

809
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,000
of you and me over the years.

810
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,240
Now, the nation has awakened

811
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,760
and is putting into action.

812
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,040
This is a leap.

813
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
As the initiator, we can't stop it.

814
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,840
You can't stop it.

815
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,800
Mr. Sun Yat-sen said

816
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,360
the world trend is mighty and irreversible.

817
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
Follow it, and you will prosper; defy it, and you will die.

818
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
We should be promoters

819
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,160
not capitulators.

820
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,160
The only way to save China

821
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,600
is to let the people face it directly.

822
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
There is no other way.

823
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,120
I suppose

824
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,040
that there are many people who think like you.

825
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,120
Therefore, my wording is mild.

826
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,720
I hope you can understand.

827
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,640
I noticed that.

828
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,840
Shizhi, from the May Fourth Movement to this day,

829
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,520
it's been over a month.

830
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,440
People have given a lot.

831
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
We can't withdraw the fire, we can only add firewood.

832
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,680
Without more effort, the Beiyang government

833
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,560
will probably take the the country's criticism

834
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,840
and go its own way

835
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,440
to sign the Paris Peace Treaty.

836
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,960
By then,

837
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,800
we will not only lose all our efforts,

838
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,720
but also lose our country.

839
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,160
The wolfish nature of the Japanese

840
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
can be understood by anyone.

841
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,680
When the country is in danger,

842
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
in the face of national interests,

843
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,120
we can't be different in thinking and faith.

844
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,960
Brother Zhongfu, don't worry.

845
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,280
I won't hold you back.

846
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,560
Although now,

847
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,720
we have some ideological differences,

848
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,160
we love our country, defend it,

849
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,680
strive for democracy, and seek development.

850
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
We must agree in the general direction.

851
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
I agree with the declaration you drafted.

852
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,240
I would also like to translate it into English.

853
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,720
But you two distinguished professors of Peking University,

854
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,800
I strongly disagree with handing out leaflets.

855
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,320
As for throwing leaflets on the street,

856
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,760
that's like giving flesh to hungry tigers.

857
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,520
Here.

858
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,000
Let's drink to the three of us.

859
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,120
Here.

860
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,040
Today, these two jars of old wine are for us

861
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,160
to drink.

862
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,440
According to the informant,

863
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,960
the printing house at No. 18 Dagoutou

864
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,560
was also a printing site for Chen Duxiu.

865
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,640
Sometimes some leaflets that are not suitable for printing in Peking University.

866
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,320
In particular, Li Dazhao engaged

867
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,840
in some long articles introducing Marxism.

868
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,960
Most are printed here

869
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,840
in small quantities.

870
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,960
Looks like it's not for distribution.

871
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,080
It's supposed to be for reading.

872
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,120
What do you think?

873
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,400
It is necessary to strengthen supervision of those behind the scenes

874
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,360
to prevent them from striking.

875
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,720
Divisional teams.

876
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
According to informant,

877
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,480
the secret inspection focuses on No. 18 Dagoutou.

878
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,200
Search!

879
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,840
Yes!

880
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,840
Here.

881
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,483
Mind the step.

882
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:51,120
Watch the step.

883
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,600
Lift the leg.

884
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,320
Lift the leg.

885
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,240
Go down.

886
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,520
Good. Good.

887
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,160
Careful.

888
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
You said you three really drank so much.

889
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,840
Shizhi also drank so much.

890
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,840
Dongxiu just gave birth.

891
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,480
What if he goes back and throws up and goes crazy?

892
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,760
Sister-in-law, don't blame brother Zhongfu for this.

893
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,800
Blame me.

894
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,720
The main thing is that I'm not very talkative.

895
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,080
It made Shizhi feel bad.

896
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,040
He drank too much.

897
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,440
Shouchang, I didn't drink too much.

898
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,000
All right. All right.

899
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,200
I haven't had enough.

900
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Brother Zhongfu, please stay.

901
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,960
Yannian and I will take him back.

902
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,560
Okay.

903
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,600
Who will you send?

904
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,560
Send you.

905
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
Who? Who?

906
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,080
Don't send me.

907
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm not drunk.

908
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,792
I said I'm not drunk.

909
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,280
Not drunk.

910
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,120
I'm not drunk.

911
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,880
I go myself.

912
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,760
Okay.

913
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,640
Go myself.

914
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,160
Let him go alone.

915
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,960
Shizhi.

916
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,280
Wait. Wait.

917
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,000
Wait. Wait.

918
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,080
I'm not drunk.

919
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,640
I--

920
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,400
Not drunk.

921
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,360
I'm not.

922
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,000
Wait. Wait.

923
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,040
I'm really not drunk.

924
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,760
You wait.

925
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,920
Shizhi.

926
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,120
Watch your step on the road ahead.

927
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,960
Zhongfu.

928
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,280
Shouchang.

929
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,880
On the road ahead, we'll

930
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,280
watch our step.

931
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,800
I'm leaving.

932
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,000
You slow down.

933
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,760
I'm not drunk with my shoes.

934
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,520
I'll go by myself, sister-in-law.

935
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,865
I--

936
00:39:58,865 --> 00:39:59,760
I'll send him back.

937
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,400
Shouchang, you--

938
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,360
You take care of Zhongfu.

939
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,240
Okay, you can rest assured.

940
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,600
I'm not drunk, sister-in-law

941
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,680
You haven't drunk for a while and fell into the mud.

942
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,880
Yannian, screw your dad.

943
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,080
Watch the road.

944
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,680
My shoes.

945
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,320
Brother Zhongfu, I will turn over what you told me at night.

946
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,000
I won't keep you.

947
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,560
Yannian, you help him over.

948
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,240
Slow down, slow down.

949
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,240
Come on.

950
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,280
Brother Zhongfu.

951
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,680
That thing

952
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,000
should not be printed in the Red Building.

953
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,600
Too high profile.

954
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,800
I see.

955
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,000
I'll go to Dagoutou for printing tomorrow.

956
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,960
Leave this to me.

957
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,120
I do all the printing and distribution.

958
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,800
It's not convenient for you to come forward.

959
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,120
Shouchang, I have made up my mind.

960
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
How about this? You go print.

961
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,200
Let's meet at Dagoutou tomorrow noon.

962
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,440
Each one takes half

963
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,960
and goes at night.

964
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,320
You know what?

965
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,800
We'll talk about this tomorrow when we meet.

966
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
Give me the manuscript first.

967
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,080
About handing out flyers tomorrow,

968
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,520
don't let Yannian know.

969
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,440
Don't involve Yannian, either.

970
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,920
I don't want him involved.
