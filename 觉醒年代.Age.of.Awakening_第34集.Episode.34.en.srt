00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
Laboratory and Prison 

4
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,880
There are two origins of civilization in the world.

5
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,880
The first is the scientific research laboratory.

6
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
It's a prison.

7
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,120
Our youth aspire to

8
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,880
If you leave the lab, you will go to jail. 

9
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Out of the prison into the laboratory.

10
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,440
This is the most noble and beautiful life in life.

11
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,960
Civilization from these two places is the true civilization.

12
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
Is a civilization with life and value.

13
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,040
Fellow citizens

14
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,280
Now all the people in the country are up.

15
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,160
Just yesterday

16
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,840
Shanghai and Tianjin have been fully implemented.

17
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
Students strike

18
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,280
strikes of workers

19
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
Businessmen strike

20
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,720
Many firms in Shanghai have also posted the unveiling posts.

21
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
Stop business with tears to save the arrested students 

22
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
Don't punish the thief and swear not to open the market. 

23
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,960
Right now.

24
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,200
Petition group organized by Beijing Federation of Students

25
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
Has arrived at the presidential palace.

26
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
There are three requirements we put forward.

27
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
The first point is to punish traitors.

28
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Second, Qingdao does not sign.

29
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,480
the third point

30
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,680
Never recognize Hu Renyuan as the president of Peking University. 

31
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,200
And determined.

32
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,280


33
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,360


34
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,480
Don't leave until you allow it.

35
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
good

36
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,200
good

37
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
good

38
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
Severely punish traitors

39
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
Give me back Qingdao and my freedom.

40
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,360
Severely punish traitors

41
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,440


42
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Severely punish traitors

43
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,880
Give me back Qingdao and my freedom.

44
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,640
Down with traitors

45
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,600
Cao Rulin Zhang Zongxiang

46
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
Down with traitors

47
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,040
Cao Rulin Zhang Zongxiang

48
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
The Beiyang government brutally suppressed

49
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,560
The atrocities of the student patriotic movement

50
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
Aroused great indignation among the people.

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,520
From the beginning of June

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,480
Tens of thousands of teachers and students in dozens of schools in Beijing 

53
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
take to the streets

54
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,960
Hold large-scale demonstrations and speeches. 

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,240
Workers and businessmen

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
And other social classes.

57
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,480
Strike one after another.

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Student solidarity movement

59
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,760
Shanghai, Jinan, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places

60
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
There was also a massive outbreak.

61
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,400
Strikes and strikes

62
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
The May 4th Movement spread rapidly.

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,520


64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Like volcanoes.

65
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:07,840
Like volcanoes.

66
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,040
Outbreaks all over the country

67
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,400

Thank you for waiting.

Emergency

71
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
The president has some unfinished business. 

72
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
Let me come here first. 

73
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,880
have a seat

74
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,880
Change of circumstances

75
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Both of you know the situation in Beijing. 

76
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
I won't say it.

77
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
Let's talk about Shanghai first

78
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,320
Shanghai appeared this afternoon.

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
The Three Strikes of Strike

80
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,800
All walks of life in Shanghai are at Kalden West Hotel, Ningbo Road. 

81
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,080
Hold a joint meeting

82
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Shanghai Business School Newspaper was founded. 

83
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,360
All walks of life Federation

84
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,640
And electrify the whole country.

85
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
Indicates that there is a traitor.

86
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,520
Industry and commerce is the hub industry.

87
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,720
Industry and commerce are in business for a day.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
Swear not to look back

89
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,880
Except Shanghai.

90
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,640
More than a dozen cities across the country

91
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
And Paris in Europe, Tokyo in Japan.

92
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,320
There have also been large-scale

93
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,440
Protest against government activities

94
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,720
Today is the only day.

95
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,080
Presidential Palace and State Council

96
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,760
More than 300 protest messages were received.

97
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,120
unprecedented

98
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
More importantly,

99
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,200
The southern government is ready to move.

100
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,240
South government Xin Xin Yu dong

101
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,520
Take this opportunity to attract people's hearts.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
Attack my government wantonly.

103
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,040
Even some foreign banks and trading companies.

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
And asked us to control the situation as soon as possible.

105
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,400
To protect the interests of foreign businessmen.

106
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,040
Today's education in Beijing is completely out of control.

107
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
A situation that has just improved in the previous period 

108
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,880
Instantly disappear.

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Almost all schools are on the streets today.

110
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,840
There was a workers' parade in Xindian.

111
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Workers, that's a big deal.

112
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,640
See this situation can't clean up.

113
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,200
President Duan Shi and I just now. 

114
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,320
An urgent business together.

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Agree that it is imperative to control the situation. 

116
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,840
Try every means to win over the students.

117
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
What's the best way to do it now? 

118
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
There are ways.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,680
Calling you two here is a way to do it. 

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
But this way

121
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,000
It's up to you two to implement it. 

122
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,520
Ask the Prime Minister for instructions.

123
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,800
Duan Shuai believes

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,880
During the negotiation with the southern government.

125
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,480
The student disturbance.

126
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Has become the southern government.

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,200
Attack a mouthful of our door.

128
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,720
We can't lose big because of small things.

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,960
Make the front and rear are messed up.

130
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
We should try every means to stabilize Beijing.

131
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,480
How to take the old section mainly?

132
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,480
This is not his style.

133
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,080
This is not mainly.

134
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,320
It's strategy, strategy.

135
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,160
The nonsense novel.

136
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,000
What's the trick? Come on 

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,320
Presidential decree

138
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
Remove the step army from commanding Wang Huaiqing.

139
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,160
Guard the position of commander Duan Zhigui.

140
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
All infantry, soldiers, etc. shall be evacuated.

141
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
Public security in Beijing

142
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,760
It will be handed over to the Metropolitan Police Department.

143
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,840
This makes Xu Shichang

144
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,480
This is a step for students.

145
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,840
Tell me.

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Why am I the only one to take my life?

147
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
And this is only a few days. 

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
Just let those two go? ：

149
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,160
You wait.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
The soldier withdrew so many students. 

151
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
Can the police manage it?

152
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Director Wu, if you have any complaints

153
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
Please send it to your master Duan Qirui.

154
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm just instructed to convey

155
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,800
If you still want to come to the meeting tomorrow

156
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,000
Just go and carry out the task.

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,520
I'm not complaining.

158
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,960
I just want to say 

159
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,800
The troops withdrew, the gendarmerie withdrew. 

160
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,800
What are the police still doing there?

161
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,000
keep the peace

162
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
Wait for the evacuation order

163
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
nicely

164
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,280
Chief fu

165
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,920
Instruct you to consult with the principals of each school as soon as possible.

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
How to deal with the aftermath of police evacuation. 

167
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
The government has only one condition.

168
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
Students resume classes immediately.

169
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
Just let the students go.

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
I can coordinate.

171
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,160
But the government must ensure that

172
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,160
The military police must not ask about the students again. 

173
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
About school.

174
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,400
When the police get involved, it will be bad.

175
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Do you think I want to take care of your shit?

176
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,080
Is that your management is lax.

177
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
Let a bunch of scholars stir up trouble among the students.

178
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,240
If it weren't for that.

179
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,440
Lao tze is very comfortable.

180
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:55,920
enough

181
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,480


182
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,160
Does the noise work?

183
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
Director Wu

184
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
The dismissal order of both of them

185
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,480
It's up to you to convey it 

186
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:10,960
good

187
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,440
good

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
You wait.

189
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
This is your business. Why should I go?

190
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
This is the instruction of Duan Shuai and the President.

191
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
You weigh yourself.

192
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
I have to I'll go. 

193
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,760
Director Wu, I also went to implement my work.

194
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,160
Decree of the President of the Republic of China

195
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Immediate release

196
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
The detention of all the arrested students 

197
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Police unconditional

198
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
All personnel withdraw from the temple of writing horses along the North River.

199
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,560
The Ministry of Education is responsible for public security.

200
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,000
Xu Shichang, President of the Republic of China

201
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,200
unlocking

202
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,440
What's going on?

203
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
Students, students

204
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400
You must calm down.

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
Come out and talk slowly if you have something to say.

206
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,280
After collective discussion, all our students

207
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,440
Determined never to get out of prison.

208
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,560
Never get out of prison

209
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,280
classmates

210
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,600
This is the Beijing Student Union.

211
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
A telegram just sent to the whole country. 

212
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,000
I was ordered to read it out.

213
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,640
The government is trifling with itself.

214
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,920
Students' gratuitous quilt

215
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,520
Never disperse on its own.

216
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
The military police's reckless education undermines justice.

217
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,560
Violation of human rights and contempt for humanity

218
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Why is this long privilege a country?

219
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
Why never get out of prison for our country?

220
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
Why never get out of prison for our country?

221
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Tell me what you want.

222
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,200
So that the students can come out. 

223
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
Please be more specific.

224
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,440
Okay, I'll go back and ask my superiors for instructions.

225
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,800
Dismiss a traitor

226
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,560
Zhang Zongxiang, Cao Rulin Lu Zongyu

227
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,400
Okay, okay, no problem

228
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
I'll ask my superiors for instructions right away.

229
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
Yes, victory is in sight. 

230
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,560
Hang in there. Yeah

231
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,280
Come on, come on.

232
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,080
oil; fuel charging; make a greater effort

233
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,320
oil; fuel charging; make a greater effort

234
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,480


235
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,560
Now students' requirements are

236
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,760
Must be removed

237
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,800
Cao Rulin

238
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,920
zhang zongxiang

239
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
Lu Zongyu

240
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,640
This is also their bottom line.

241
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,680
Otherwise, it will be difficult to convince him.

242
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Students push their luck.

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
Explain that there must be someone behind you.

244
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,360
Let's talk about it. What should we do 

245
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,840
I'll speak first.

246
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,760
I have received it today.

247
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,600
Four telegrams from President Lu from Paris. 

248
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,800
Say in Paris.

249
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,400
Chinese delegation's residence

250
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,520
Has been surrounded by water.

251
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
The local Chinese proposed

252
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,120
The government can detain patriotic students.

253
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,240
They can follow suit. 

254
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,360
China's detention envoy

255
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,280
Don't let the students out again

256
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,560
People from the delegation

257
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
It is likely to be regarded as a traitor.

258
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,920
Be attacked by the local Chinese. 

259
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
I studied the students' requirements carefully.

260
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,640
It's not really high. 

261
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
After all, I didn't move out the Paris Peace Treaty.

262
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,560
at bottom

263
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,960
Is nothing more than to remove Cao Zhanglu.

264
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,640
It's just exporting gas to Chinese people.

265
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
I don't think it's because these people

266
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,680
And missed the big event. 

267
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,600
It's time to make up your mind.

268
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
Drag it down again

269
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,200
Students should make other demands. 

270
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,400
That would be troublesome.

271
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,520
I agree with Premier Qian's opinion.

272
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,440
I agree with Premier Qian's opinion.

273
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
I agree with Premier Qian's opinion.

274
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,040
I agree. I agree.

275
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,920
I also agree with the Prime Minister's opinion.

276
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
Director Wu, what's your opinion? 

277
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,880
At this point.

278
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,240
What else can I say?

279
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
I'll just carry out your decision.

280
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,880
Good director Wu's attitude is very good.

281
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
Now everyone is in agreement.

282
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,280
I also discussed this matter with Lao Duan.

283
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,400
Now it's here again.

284
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,640
It's really time to get past this hurdle.

285
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,560
Had to be wronged first.

286
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,080
How many of them are in Cao Rulin? 

287
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,160
So please ask Acting Chief Fu to represent me. 

288
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,320
Officially to the students

289
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,040
At the same time, the official withdrawal is released. 

290
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
Cao Zhanglu's position order

291
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,040
be

292
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,200
Presidential decree

293
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,640
Cao Rulin Zhang Zongxiang and Lu Zong were dismissed.

294
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,520
Cao Rulin resigned at the same time. 

295
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,520
Bank of Communications Manager Position 

296
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,280
Wangxiaotangshan

297
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
Xu Shichang

298
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:12,960
Chinese academic circles Fang Luo

299
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,000
Chinese academic circles

300
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
Long live Chinese academic circles!

301
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,520
Long live Chinese academic circles!

302
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
Long live Chinese academic circles!

303
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,480
We won

304
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,480
ladies and gentlemen

305
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,000
originally

306
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,560
I thought Peking University was going to die this time. Really? 

307
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
But I didn't expect it to come back to life.

308
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,000
So say anything.

309
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,040
All need you to pass.

310
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
Just stick to it one more time.

311
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,560
I'm not as optimistic as you.

312
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,720
Now it's just a staged victory.

313
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
Master Cai hasn't come back yet

314
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,640
The back is indispensable.

315
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:10,960
There must be a bigger toss behind.

316
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,200
And the Paris peace treaty is still to be remembered. 

317
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,680
This matter is not resolved.

318
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,880
Never stop.

319
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
Fortunately, there is already hope. 

320
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,240
Mr. Lu Xun

321
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
What spark of thought do you have? 

322
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,440
Come out and listen.

323
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,880
What have I seen this month?

324
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
The backbone of China 

325
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,440
中富兄

326
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,200
Enlightenment Effect of New Culture Movement

327
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,400
Has already appeared.

328
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,720
East Asian lions are awakening. 

329
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,960
So what's next?

330
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,280
To destroy the national character

331
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,960
The servility of resignation.

332
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,480
Turn him around.

333
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,680
Then let's pursue the victory

334
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,520
Urge the government to refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty 

335
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,040
Don't give up until you reach your goal.

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
I have a different point of view.

337
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,080
Modern society pays attention to their respective duties.

338
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,240
We are a school.

339
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Peking University is the highest institution of higher learning in China.

340
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,320
We have to be 1000. We in Peking University 

341
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,200
What should be done

342
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,040
We managed to get through this barrier.

343
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,040
Now we should pay attention.

344
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
How to put it as soon as possible.

345
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,720
Come back to our school order.

346
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,640
The first priority is to attend class quickly.

347
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,320
Mr. Shizhi, please ask patriotism and class

348
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,320
Which is Peking University's top priority?

349
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,880
Patriotism is not contradictory to class.

350
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,200
So you can save the country without class?

351
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,320
We are a school.

352
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,800
Patriotic and national salvation is a long-term solution.

353
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,800
Class is a daily business.

354
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,440
Priorities are self-evident.

355
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,640
A rare gathering in a crisis.

356
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,880
Let's talk about our New Youth.

357
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,760
And the Weekly Review.

358
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,600
What's the next step?

359
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
I have an idea.

360
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,560
Our New Youth has been founded for more than three years.

361
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,680
Straight in enlightening people's thoughts.

362
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,800
How about now

363
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
People have begun to wake up.

364
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,960
After the awakening

365
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,480
what's up

366
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
I wonder if you have ever thought about this question.

367
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,160
The most realistic thing now is to boycott the Paris Peace Treaty.

368
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,160
Give Qingdao back.

369
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
You can't win if you don't take the risk.

370
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,280
right

371
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,560
Deqian

372
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,160
After boycotting the Paris Peace Treaty? 

373
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,840
If a country's

374
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,280
If the problem is not solved at all 

375
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,480
Similar problems will also

376
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,760
Come out one by one.

377
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,200
It is also empty talk to strengthen the country and enrich the people.

378
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
What's wrong now

379
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
It's this rotten regime.

380
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Then my point is clear.

381
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,560
Beijing will fight to the end.

382
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm still a cliche

383
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,360
I don't advocate violent revolution

384
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,640
I don't advocate talking about socialism all the time.

385
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,240
Be practical.

386
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
Speaking of learning from foreign countries

387
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
My opinion is to learn from America.

388
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
Everyone, don't forget

389
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,360
Our new culture movement

390
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Our banner is science and democracy.

391
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,040
So China needs to develop.

392
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,040
We must study American pressure in an all-round way.

393
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,400
Deqian

394
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,800
Didn't you tell me the other day

395
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Do you think Shizhi has some foreign worship?

396
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,320
Why don't you speak?

397
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,160
Democracy means different opinions.

398
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,760
The so-called democracy

399
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Don't hide it.

400
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,960
I wanted to publish it.

401
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,040
But I really haven't organized it yet.

402
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,560
Shizhi

403
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,440
Worship foreign things and never flatter me.

404
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,280
Never flatter

405
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
Excuse me, Dr. Hu Da

406
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,400
These days

407
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,680
You clip a bag every day

408
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,600
Behind Professor Dewey's ass. 

409
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
Like a sidekick. Isn't that flattering?

410
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Shizhi, I think you are particularly like a person.

411
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,160
Who?

412
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,560
Lao Tzu Liu Er beside Gu Ming 

413
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,800
yes or no 

414
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,680
Bannong, the reason why I say this 

415
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
I think we can all express our opinions.

416
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,280
However, we express our views in order to find the direction.

417
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,400
As for different opinions, it is familiar or not.

418
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,000
That depends on the different national conditions and times.

419
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,000
a gentleman gets along with others

420
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,280
This harmony is what we have in common now.

421
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
What do you have in common?

422
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,240
I think that is no matter what.

423
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,280
We should transform the current society. 

424
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
It is transformation, not improvement.

425
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,600
Is a revolution.

426
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,560
This is because I saw the Beiyang government.

427
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
After all sorts of perversions.

428
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,120
Come to a conclusion.

429
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
And I want to tell you.

430
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,240
Since we have launched such a campaign

431
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
Then at this critical moment

432
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,720
We should stand up bravely.

433
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,520
Direct action

434
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
This is also us who are awakened.

435
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,800
Responsibility and responsibility in the present

436
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,280
Do you have no clothes and robes with your son?

437
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
I advance and retreat with you.

438
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,080
I'm one of them.

439
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,560
Shouchang

440
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,160
I have a worry.

441
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:58,960
any

442
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,040


443
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,520
any

444
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,000
Worried about the split of our New Youth.

445
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,400
Now we quarrel almost as soon as we meet. 

446
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,640
I know what you mean.

447
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,560


448
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
Too superstitious about Dewey's set of experimentalism.

449
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,560
Actually, he doesn't want to think about it.

450
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
China's feudal system for thousands of years 

451
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
How can it be changed by talking and writing?

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
If there is no big revolution

453
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
China can't catch up with the world trend.

454
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
I used to think that you two

455
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,240
You are too radical.

456
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
Where's Shizhi? He's too moderate.

457
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,520
I choose between you two.

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But now I think

459
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
I have more tendencies.

460
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,560
This is bound to make Shizhi feel more isolated

461
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,800
Shouchang, let me remind you

462
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,720
Shizhi is very proud.

463
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,440
Don't be too hard on him on some occasions.

464
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,160
There are some things I'll tell you about him.

465
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,520
He can get by.

466
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
You talk too much, it's hard for his face.

467
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,040
You can rest assured.

468
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,880
I didn't treat him as an outsider.

469
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
What do you mean by tendency just now?

470
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,280
About Marxism

471
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
A while ago, I was compiling New Youth.

472
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,120
Next issue's manuscript 

473
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
I put the long article you wrote

474
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
My View of Marxism

475
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,720
Read it again carefully. 

476
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,680
At the same time, I put April 6

477
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,120
Published by the Weekly Review

478
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
Chapter II of the Communist Manifesto

479
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
Proletarians and Communists

480
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,640
I also read it carefully. 

481
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,320
I feel a lot of feelings.

482
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,400


483
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,200
I feel a lot of feelings.

484
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,520
Be deeply touched and full of emotion

485
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:31,840
Be very touched, have a lot of feelings

486
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,840
You said in the editor's note 

487
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
Manifesto of the Communist Party

488
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,800
Marx and Engels.

489
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
First and foremost opinion

490
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,160
This is a great inspiration to me. 

491
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,680
Shouchang, I think you are now

492
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
Chinese propaganda and belief

493
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
The first person of Marxism

494
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,320
So I need to ask you something.

495
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,760
Ask for advice.

496
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Actually, when I was in Japan

497
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
I've been paying attention to Marxist theory.

498
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm writing now.

499
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,320
My View of Marxism

500
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,040
Lower part

501
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,120
But I really want to know.

502
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,080
Your views and opinions on the first half

503
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,800
At least now I think

504
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,280
Marxism is better than anarchism.

505
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,120
Be more reasonable

506
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
It is more rational than Dewey's experimentalism.

507
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,160
But as to whether it is the present age or not.

508
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
The most advanced theoretical system

509
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,120
It's hard to say. 

510
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,640
Because I didn't see it 

511
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,200
All Marxist works

512
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,920
In fact, for Marxist theory

513
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,760
I have been paying attention to it for many years.

514
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,040
I found out when I was in Japan before. 

515
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,200
There are many people studying in Japan.

516
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
Marx's socialist theory 

517
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,400
Translated a lot of materials.

518
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
Originally, I just read its principle.

519
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,000
Such as historical materialism.

520
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,080


521
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,200
Such as historical materialism.

522
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,640
dialectical materialism

523
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,840
Socialism from Utopia to Science

524
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,680
But recently

525
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,920
I will combine it with the reality of China to read it.

526
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,720
The more I read, the more I feel open. 

527
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Brother Zhongfu, I have an idea 

528
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,960
If China wants to develop

529
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,200
We must rely on Marxist theory.

530
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,720
To be our guiding ideology.

531
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,360
Besides, it's hard to find a second way. 

532
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,280
Are you so sure of your conclusion? 

533
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,360
This is just my preliminary idea.

534
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,360
But after the May 4th Movement

535
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,080
My idea is getting stronger and stronger.

536
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,080
Of course, it also needs to be demonstrated and considered.

537
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
So what do you think?

538
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
Russian October Revolution

539
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,720
This question

540
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
I published it before.

541
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,680
In the Comparative View of French-Russian Revolution

542
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,720
I'll explain it.

543
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
In general

544
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,480
China's October Revolution

545
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,720
It is completely different from the British and French revolutions.

546
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,280
I think it is the most advanced revolution.

547
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
How do you say this?

548
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,360
In the final analysis, the British and French revolutions of the past

549
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,520
It is also a bourgeois revolution.

550
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
But the October Revolution in China was different. 

551
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,840
It is led by the proletariat.

552
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
socialist revolution

553
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,800
According to Marxist theory

554
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
socialist revolution

555
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
Is the inevitable result of the development of capitalism.

556
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,280
In this sense.

557
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
It must be the most progressive revolution.

558
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
I don't read many books of Marx.

559
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,480
But I know

560
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,040
A basic viewpoint of socialist theory

561
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,000
Is the socialist revolution.

562
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,360
Only after capitalism has fully developed.

563
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,480
Talent explosion

564
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,160
But now Russia is pressing.

565
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,400
It is not a developed capitalist country. 

566
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,560
I didn't know this at first.

567
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
But then I read Lenin's book.

568
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,320
I just learned that/I just realized/I just found out

569
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,680
Lenin has a point of view

570
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,360
socialist revolution

571
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,200
Can be in the imperialist

572
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,040
Break out in the weak link

573
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
And succeed.

574
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,480
Look at the Russian October Revolution.

575
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,320
It's been almost two years now.

576
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,520
Soviet regime

577
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
Surrounded by the layers of imperialism

578
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
Have gained a firm foothold.

579
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
This is enough to illustrate Lenin's point of view. 

580
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,760
Is correct.

581
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,880
auv nana

582
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,920
A poor and weak country like China

583
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,480
Can also make a socialist revolution.

584
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,080
I'm still studying this point.

585
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
However, the October Revolution in Russia and China 

586
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
Has set an example for us. 

587
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,800
好寿昌

588
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,320
You taught me a lesson today.

589
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,840
Junman

590
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,520
have come back

591
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,320
dad

592
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:16,800
What to do

593
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,040
Go to what?

594
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,080
Go out with her.

595
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,600
sir

596
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,880
We'll have dinner soon.

597
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,280
Add a few more dishes

598
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,000
Add a few more dishes

599
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm going to invite Shouchang and Shizhi to dinner tonight.

600
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,200
good

601
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,720
scented

602
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,560
sister-in-law

603
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,280
come on

604
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm eating Anhui food again.

605
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,840
Strictly speaking, this is not Anhui cuisine.

606
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,400
Huizhou cuisine refers to Huizhou cuisine.

607
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,160
This should be Anhui cuisine.

608
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,360
Or Anqing cuisine.

609
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,480
Then enjoy your meal.

610
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,920
I went out to take the children to dinner.

611
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,040
Thanks, sister-in-law.

612
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,600
Don't mention it.

613
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,280
Here comes the wine, gentlemen. Hello

614
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This is General Zou Yongcheng.

615
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,160
Two jars of old wine brought to me by my client. 

616
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
He said it's been on for a long time. 

617
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,880
We turned it on today.

618
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,360
good

619
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,240
寿昌兄

620
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm willing to come to Zhongfu for dinner.

621
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,120
Look at so many good dishes.

622
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,960
Old wine has also been brought out for us.

623
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,120
When I was Yannian's age,

624
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
It's both children.

625
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
Yannian has six abstinence from drinking.

626
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,120
I'm not strong with him

627
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
But I asked him to pour wine for two uncles.

628
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
It's my respect for you both.

629
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
Brother Zhongfu, what are you doing?

630
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,200
No, no.

631
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,840
It's nothing

632
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,400
The students were released.

633
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,480
Cao Rulin Zhangzongxiang Lu Zongyu

634
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm glad they're all dismissed. 

635
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,400
Want to drink some wine

636
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,760
Come on, guys.

637
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,400
Let me propose a toast to you first.

638
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,520
Did it?

639
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,720
good

640
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
Henian

641
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,080
Go to eat.

642
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,240
Here comes the Year of the Crane. 

643
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
They are eating fish. 

644
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,400
We have meat. Meat is better than fish.

645
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,040
Here, mom, get you a piece of meat.

646
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
Why can't I go?

647
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,400
It's too personal.

648
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,560
You will be eighteen next year.

649
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,120
You will be eighteen next year.

650
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,320
You can go to the table. 

651
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,040
The old man is also the leader of the new culture movement.

652
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
Engage in these feudal ethical codes at home. 

653
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,320
I protest

654
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,200
I also protest.

655
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,440
Why don't you let me be with Yannian's brother?

656
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
I also protest against the feudalism of the old man 

657
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,480
Keep your voice down

658
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,920
Why are you so rude?

659
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,280
Eat some meat.

660
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,560
Stop protesting, go and eat meat. 

661
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,440
Delicious

662
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,000
You all know.

663
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,760
I was stimulated the other day.

664
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
Sort of.

665
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
Experienced a thoroughly remould oneself

666
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,960
Brother Zhongfu, don't worry too much.

667
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,720
It's all in the past

668
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,840
Now let's Peking University

669
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,960
Isn't it Peking University again

670
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
Is Peking University the original Peking University?

671
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
I don't know.

672
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,720
我陈独秀

673
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,320
It's not the original Chen Duxiu anymore. 

674
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,560
This is an article I wrote yesterday.

675
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,680
Yannian

676
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,800
Read it to two uncles.

677
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
Beijing Citizen Manifesto

678
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,400
China is a nation that loves peace. 

679
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,520
Today, though it is subjected to unbearable oppression both inside and outside.

680
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,960
Renbensi purport

681
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,600
For the government's final minimum requirements 

682
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,840
Diplomacy towards Japan

683
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
Do not abandon the economic rights of Shandong Province. 

684
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,240
And cancel two secret agreements in four years and seven years of the Republic of China.

685
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
Mianshu Cao Rulin

686
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,680
Lu Zongyu Zhangzongxiang Duan Zhigui

687
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,880
Wait for six people in Wang Huaiqing.

688
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,640
And expelled from Beijing.

689
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
Cancel the step army commander

690
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,680
And the garrison commander.

691
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,960
4. The Beijing Security Team will be organized by citizens.

692
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
5. Citizens must have

693
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
Absolute freedom of assembly and speech

694
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
I still hope that the people can achieve this goal by peaceful means.

695
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,600
The government is still unwilling to make peace.

696
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,680
Completely disobey the wishes of the citizens.

697
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,920


698
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,760
Soldiers can only act directly.

699
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,440
Make a fundamental transformation.

700
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,560
Hereby declare

701
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,880
To the people at home and abroad for understanding.

702
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,080
Brother Zhongfu, what does this mean?

703
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,560
This is what I'm talking about.

704
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,800
We should stand up bravely.

705
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
I have three points to explain.

706
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,120
First, I totally agree with Shouchang.

707
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,920
Expand the student movement into

708
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,800
Social movements and mass movements

709
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,720
Make clear our requirements for the next step. 

710
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,960
Publicly declare

711
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,600
If the government doesn't respect public opinion 

712
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
We will take direct action.

713
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
In order to realize the fundamental transformation of society.

714
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,960
And today?

715
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,400
I just want to ask the opinions of three people.

716
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,640
And I also want Shizhi to translate it into English. 

717
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,800
Brother Zhongfu, that's great

718
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,760
Mobilize the public to publish widely.

719
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,320
Yannian, you print more

720
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,320
Give it to me after printing, and I'll distribute it myself.

721
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,040
good

722
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,320
寿昌兄

723
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
You are an open young tutor of Peking University professor. 

724
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
Hand out leaflets on the street.

725
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,840
What a scandal!

726
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,320
不是史鸷

727
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,600
I never put my Li Dazhao

728
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,040
Look superior to others

729
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Look, for the national interest

730
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,560
People can go to the streets, workers can go to the streets.

731
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,080
Women can go to the streets.

732
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,600
What can't I do on the street?

733
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,880
Don't you tell people about equality and freedom every day? 

734
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,800
Why can't you come to me?

735
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
Shizhi, I look at you

736
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,560


737
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
Inner old morality

738
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,560
It's not what it looks like.

739
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,360
Shouchang, I've always respected you. Yes

740
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,200
The iron man in culture.

741
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,120
But I really don't understand.

742
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,360
You and brother Zhongfu 

743
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,280
We are all literate people.

744
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,280
What are we going to talk about?

745
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,960
A literate person is a scholar. 

746
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,480
Scholars pay attention to

747
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,560
Improve their own self-cultivation, manage home economics, good governance in the region, and finally make the national peace

748
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,000
Have the feelings of home and country, cultivate Qi and make peace. 

749
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,800
Now we have been doing self-cultivation.

750
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
Family. Is our family all together?

751
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,720
Guys, it's hard.

752
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,160
From poverty to the present

753
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,440
And now?

754
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
It's also a red rabbit in Lu Bu's horse.

755
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,920
But why do you have to ruin your future?

756
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,760
Even at the expense of his wife and children.

757
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
I really don't know what you are doing.

758
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,400
Actually, that's a good question.

759
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
Now let me answer you. 

760
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,760
I don't think people can live for themselves.

761
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,640
You go to Changxindian

762
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,560
Look at those dilapidated sheds.

763
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,800
You go to the Jinpu Line to see those.

764
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
Hungry refugees in the hatchery

765
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
Go to Qianmen Street again.

766
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,760
Look at those people who beg along the street.

767
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Shouldn't we order something for them?

768
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,160
Do you expect us to be like you?

769
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,520
Live in a glamorous way?

770
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,000
Mr. Dazhao

771
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,600
I think what you said is too good. 

772
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,400
The country should throw caution to the wind at this point.

773
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,440
Give up a small family to take care of everyone.

774
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,120
You can't have it both ways.

775
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,080
Yannian, do you have anything to say? 

776
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,040
Brother Zhongfu is fine.

777
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,120
Yannian can express his opinion.

778
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,920
Sorry, Uncle Hu

779
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,720
Shizhi

780
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,360
I was a little harsh just now. 

781
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,880
sorry

782
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,080
Out of the way.

783
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,640
It really doesn't matter.

784
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,560
I know you are an open-minded person.

785
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,400
Sit down, gentlemen.

786
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,120
Sit down, both of you

787
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,200
You all know I like to argue.

788
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,960
Only by arguing can the truth come out.

789
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,440
Let's raise our glasses.

790
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,240
come

791
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,280
Shizhi

792
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,440
It's not you, it's you.

793
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,520
You don't have to hide.

794
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,280
Tell me what you think. 

795
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm not hiding it.

796
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,120
I think

797
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,960
Brother Zhongfu wants to make this civic declaration.

798
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,400
It's unnecessary.

799
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,760
Besides, Mr Dewey has just arrived in China.

800
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,280
Just entered Beijing.

801
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,000
So every day I'm busy arranging some for him.

802
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,200
About the speech.

803
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,680
I need to talk to the Ministry of Education about all these things.

804
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,360
And some government departments.

805
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,120
Please come forward and arrange it in person. 

806
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,600
I don't want to make these relationships too rigid.

807
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
Mobilize the citizens for democracy. I agree.

808
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
I also agree with the five points mentioned.

809
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,720
Especially the fifth one.

810
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,720
But what it says here

811
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,840
I wait for students, businessmen, laborers and soldiers. 

812
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,440
Only direct action.

813
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,760
It's not necessary to be too tough.

814
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,480
Shizhi, why is this unnecessary?

815
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,960
This sentence is the most important, it can't live without it.

816
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,360
Shizhi, let me explain.

817
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,840
From the New Cultural Movement to the May 4th Movement

818
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,840
This is a causal relationship.

819
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
The former is ideological enlightenment.

820
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
The latter is put into action.

821
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,320
Whether you like it or not

822
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,400
These are you and me over the years.

823
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,000
The result of direct promotion

824
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,240
Now the national consciousness

825
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,760
Put it into action.

826
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,040
This is a leap.

827
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
As the initiator, we can't stop it.

828
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,840
You can't stop it.

829
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,800
sun yat-sen

830
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,360
The world tide is mighty.

831
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
If you follow the rules, you will prosper; if you follow the rules, you will die.

832
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
We should be promoters.

833
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,160
Can't be a capitulator.

834
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,160
To save China

835
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,600
Only let the people face it directly

836
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
There is no other way

837
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,120
I'm thinking.

838
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,040
There are many people with your thoughts.

839
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,120
Therefore, my wording is mild.

840
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,720
I hope you can understand 

841
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,640
I noticed that.

842
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,840
Shizhi May 4th Movement to this day

843
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,520
It's been over a month. 

844
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,440
People have paid a lot.

845
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
We can't withdraw the fire, we can only add firewood.

846
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,680
Don't work harder, Beiyang government

847
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,560
It's likely to take the risk of the world. No

848
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,840
Go one's own way

849
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,440
Sign the Paris peace treaty.

850
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,960
until this moment

851
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,800
Not only have we lost all our efforts.

852
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,720
The country is in danger.

853
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,160
Japanese wolf ambition

854
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
You can understand it if you are a person.

855
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,680
When the country is in danger

856
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
In the face of national interests

857
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,120
We can't leave Germany alone.

858
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,960
Brother Zhongfu, don't worry

859
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,280
I won't hold you back.

860
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,560
Although now

861
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,720
We have some differences in our thoughts.

862
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,160
But patriotism saves the nation.

863
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,680
Strive for democracy and development

864
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
We must agree in the general direction.

865
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
I agree with the declaration you drafted.

866
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,240
I would also like to translate it into English.

867
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,720
But you two distinguished professors of Peking University

868
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,800
I strongly disagree with handing out leaflets. 

869
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,320
As for throwing leaflets on the street.

870
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,760
That's equivalent to the flesh ammonium tiger.

871
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,520
come

872
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,000
One thousand drinks for three of us. 

873
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,120
come

874
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,040
Today, we're going to put these two jars of old wine 

875
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,160
Drink up

876
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,440
According to the informant

877
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,960
The mimeograph society at No.18 Dagou

878
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,560
It is also a unique printing point.

879
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,640
Sometimes some leaflets that are not suitable for printing in Peking University.

880
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,320
Especially some made by Li Dazhao.

881
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,840
A long article introducing Marxism

882
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,960
Most of them are printed here 

883
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,840
Not many.

884
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,960
Looks like it's not for distribution.

885
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,080
It's supposed to be for reading.

886
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,120
What do you think?

887
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,400
It is necessary to strengthen supervision of those behind the scenes.

888
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,360
Prevent them from making moves.

889
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,720
Divisional teams

890
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Secret check according to the address opened.

891
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,480
The key point is No.18 Dagoutou

892
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,200
check

893
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,840
be

894
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,840
come

895
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,120
Mind the Step

896
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,600
Leg lift

897
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,320
Leg lift

898
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,240
under

899
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,520
nicely

900
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,160
be careful

901
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
You said you really drank so much.

902
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,840
Shizhi also drinks so much. 

903
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,840
This Dongxiu just gave birth.

904
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,480
What if he goes back and throws up and goes crazy?

905
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,760
Sister-in-law doesn't blame brother Zhongfu for this.

906
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,800
I

907
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,720
The main thing is that I'm not very talkative.

908
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,080
It made Shizhi feel bad.

909
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,040
He drank too much.

910
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,440
Shouchang, I didn't drink too much

911
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,000
nicely

912
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,200
I haven't had enough.

913
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Brother Zhongfu, please stay.

914
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,960
Yannian and I will take him back.

915
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,560
good

916
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,600
Who will you send?

917
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,560
Send you.

918
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
so-and-so

919
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,080
Don't send me.

920
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm not drunk.

921
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,280
I said I didn't drink too much.

922
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,120
I'm not drunk.

923
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,880
I go

924
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,760
good

925
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,640
Walk by yourself

926
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,160
Let him go alone.

927
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,960
Shizhi

928
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,280
etc

929
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,000
etc

930
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,080
I'm not drunk.

931
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,640
I

932
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,400
Not drunk

933
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,360
I didn't.

934
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,000
etc

935
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,040
I'm really not drunk.

936
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,760
You wait.

937
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,920
Shizhi

938
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,120
Kanke, watch your step ahead.

939
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,960
Zhongfu

940
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,280
Shouchang

941
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,880
Qianlu Kanke Let's

942
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,280
Watch your step.

943
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:47,840
I'm leaving

944
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,800
I'm leaving

945
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,000
You slow down.

946
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,760
I'm not drunk with my shoes.

947
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,520
I'll go by myself, sister-in-law

948
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,760
I

949
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,400
寿昌你

950
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,360
Take care of Zhongfu

951
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,240
Okay, you can rest assured.

952
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,600
I'm not drunk, sister-in-law

953
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,680
You haven't drunk for a while and fell into the mud. 

954
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,880
Yannian, screw your dad.

955
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,080
Watch the road

956
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,680
My shoes

957
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,320
Brother Zhongfu, I will turn over what you told me at night.

958
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,000
I won't keep you.

959
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,560
Yannian, you help him over.

960
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,240
Slow down, slow down.

961
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,240
come on

962
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,280
中富兄

963
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,680
That thing

964
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,000
It should not be printed in the red chamber.

965
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,600
Too ostentatious

966
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,800
I see

967
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,000
I'll go to Dagou for printing tomorrow.

968
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,960
Leave this to me. 

969
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,120
It's all from me.

970
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,800
It's not convenient for you to come forward

971
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,120
Shouchang, I have made up my mind.

972
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
You go to print like this

973
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,200
Let's meet at Dagoutou tomorrow noon.

974
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,440
We're half each other. 

975
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,960
Go at night.

976
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,320
You know what?

977
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,800


978
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
Give me the manuscript first.

979
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,080
About handing out flyers tomorrow.

980
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,520
Don't let Yannian know

981
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,440
Don't involve Yannian, either.

982
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,920
I don't want him involved.
