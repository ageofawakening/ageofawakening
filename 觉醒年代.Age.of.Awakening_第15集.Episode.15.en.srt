00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,840

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,520


363
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360


364
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600


365
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,880

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,160


375
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,250


376
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,880


377
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,440


378
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,520


379
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,560


380
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,200


381
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,080


382
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,960


383
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,840


384
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,480
Come, come, come.

385
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
Meeting time! Meeting time! (?)

386
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
I already went over the discussion we had before (?)

387
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,560
and corrected it. (?)

388
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,760
Here, here, here.

389
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,400
Be careful.

390
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,600
Careful, careful.

391
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,490


392
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
You take a look and see what else is missing.

393
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,400
I'll change it again, and add more.

394
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,320
Come. Put it over there, put it over there.

395
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,280
It's quite detailed. Alright!

396
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,320
Look at this.

397
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,040
Alright.

398
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,680
Faster, faster.

399
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,240
Put it here.

400
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,040
Not hypocritical. (?)

401
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,520
Not idle.

402
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,720
Everyone please take a seat.

403
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,600
All, please take a seat.

404
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,160
Quite good.

405
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,640
Runzhi.

406
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:53,920
The meeting's starting.

407
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,040
Is everyone here?

408
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,560
Everyone's here.

409
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,040
Everyone should be here.

410
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,760
Runzhi.

411
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,160
Then, we are starting the meeting now.

412
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,760
You speak first Xudong.

413
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,080
Okay.

414
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,080
All members (?)

415
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,360
last winter

416
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,720
Mao Zedong waited for students

417
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,600
to send suggestions

418
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,480
to gather comrades

419
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
to organize an association

420
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,400
to create a new environment

421
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,520
for joint activities (?)

422
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,040
got everyone's responses (?)

423
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
Went through a few months of contact (?)

424
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,840
Now

425
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
finally the conditions are right (?)

426
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,200
Setting up an association

427
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,280
the goal is to reform everyone's behavior. (?)

428
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,640
To improve everyone's knowledge.

429
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,680
(?) Confucius says:

430
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
the principle of the Great Learning

431
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
is in plain virtue (?)

432
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,120
is in knowing people (?)

433
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,560
(?)

434
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,600
(?)

435
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,560
(?)

436
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,520
(?)

437
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,640
I think

438
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,320
being a generation of new people (?)

439
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,560
is our common pursuit.

440
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,760
Therefore

441
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,160
our organization's name is called "xinmin Association"

442
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,960
xinmin Association

443
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,840
This name is good!

444
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,400
This name is good!

445
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,520
Now I declare

446
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,200
xinmin Association is formally established.

447
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,680
Good!

448
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,520
Now asking Mao Zedong

449
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,760
to read "xinmin Association's regulations" (?)

450
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,200
All members

451
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,280
our xinmin Association

452
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,520
emerged from the New Culture Movement. (?)

453
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,640
Its characteristic

454
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,840
is also its spirit.

455
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,720
There's only one.

456
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,080
It is "new".

457
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,040
Therefore,

458
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,240
we need to use new ideas

459
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,440
new culture

460
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,320
new ethics

461
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,080
to arm the minds of our members.

462
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,080
To improve the moral conduct of our members.

463
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,080
To improve the learning of our members.

464
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,640
This is also xinmin Association's original intention

465
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,760
and mission.

466
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,400
Therefore

467
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
I believe xinmin association's objective

468
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
is innovative learning, (?)

469
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
honing moral conduct,

470
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
to improve the will of the people and social custom. (?)

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,640
Consequently

472
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,360
the association's regulations

473
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,680
every member must be able to accomplish them. (?)

474
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,800
First, don't be hypocritical.

475
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,320
Second, don't be idle.

476
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,840
Third, don't be wasteful.

477
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,960
Fourth, don't gamble.

478
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:45,850


479
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,160
Fifth, don't visit prostitutes (?)

480
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:46,490


481
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,600
I say

482
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Isn't this a bit too strict (?)

483
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,040
It's too harsh.

484
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320
I think what Runzhi said is right.

485
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,000
Where is it too strict, it should be strict like this. (?)

486
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
It should be like this. (?)

487
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,320
Everyone please quiet down.

488
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,320
Now we'll follow the regulations and carry out a vote. (?)

489
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
Those who agree raise your hands.

490
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,720
It passes.

491
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,840
All members

492
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
According to the regulations,

493
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,520
xinmin Association establishes one secretary-general (?)

494
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
Two executive secretaries (?)

495
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
The preparation group... also already sought everyone's opinions (?)

496
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
Seeing that member Xiao Zisheng

497
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,520
already completed studies

498
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
and graduated

499
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920
if there is a time when (?)

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,680
You can engage in the association's work. (?)

501
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,440
Recommend for general-secretary

502
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,640
Mao Zedong

503
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,320
Chen Shunong for executive secretary

504
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
Those who agree please raise your hands.

505
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,840
Pass through a unanimous vote (?)

506
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
Thank you for everyone's trust

507
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
But recently I have been getting in touch to go to France to study

508
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,680
Runzhi

509
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
The association's matters

510
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
still asking you to worry about (?)

511
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,040
It's my duty.

512
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,840
I hope I can do more for everyone (?)

513
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,320
Okay!

514
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,320
I believe

515
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
Member Zuzhi's work-study program in France (?)

516
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,680
is very necessary.

517
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
Also the association's (?)

518
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
one of the most major work (?)

519
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,840
Runzhi

520
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,120
This matter

521
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,160
we are troubling you with. (?)

522
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,800
Although

523
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
I am not very interested in going abroad to study

524
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,640
but I still wish

525
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,160
I can do more for everyone. (?)

526
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,520
Moreover,

527
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
I heard Mr. Yang Changji say before,

528
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,160
Cai Yuanpei is waiting for people

529
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,280
in Beijing

530
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
to start a prepatory school for (?)

531
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,000
sending people to a work-study program in France. (?)

532
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,960
I want to

533
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,000
write a letter to give Mr. Yang

534
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,280
to get him to help connect us. (?)

535
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,320
That's so good!

536
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,640
Runzhi

537
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,280
The France work-study program is a good matter (?)

538
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
You have to work hard on this. (?)

539
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,800
Children (?)

540
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,760
If it is doable

541
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
This elderly lady is also doing the work-study program in France.

542
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,720
Broaden the horizons.

543
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,240
Learn more new things.

544
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,120
Okay!

545
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,840
Welcome!

546
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,920
Welcoming aunt to go! My . (?)

547
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
April, 1918

548
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,560
Mao Zedong

549
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,760
Cai Hesen

550
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,120
He Shuheng etc

551
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
Established xinmin Association in Changsha.

552
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
This is New Culture Movement

553
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,080
(?)

554
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
(?)

555
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,960
Young Mao Zedong (?)

556
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,400
Seek  (?)

557
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,880
Exploitative exploitative exploitative.

558
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,320
these three "exploitatives" were written well. (?)

559
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,360
Everyone.

560
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,320
Wait, wait, wait.

561
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,600
Brother Zhongfu. Today, you

562
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
will stand on this chair and talk to everyone.

563
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
As for us, we will get a taste of

564
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
the elegant manner of brother Zhongfu's lecture.

565
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,360
Sure!

566
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
It's still teacher (?) who understands my mood.

567
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
(?)

568
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,240
Our New Youth magazine already became

569
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,560
China's most influential publication.

570
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
Good!

571
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,920
What's special is this period

572
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
Lu Xun's novel in vernacular writing (?)

573
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,360
"Diary of A Madam"

574
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,720
aroused the attention of all social circles. (?)

575
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,240
We can say this is (?)

576
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,240
New Culture Movement's milestone

577
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,440
Good! Brother Zhongfu.

578
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,560
What did I say before? (?)

579
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,480
If New Youth wants to be popular it has to come to Beijing.

580
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,760
You, you, you. Come down. You come down.

581
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,480
Come down and talk.

582
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,680
Let me stay up here to say a paragraph.

583
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,720
Okay, okay. You stand and talk.

584
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,520
I'll tell you

585
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,800
admittedly it's true that location is important.

586
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,360
But the determining factor

587
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,640
is still people.

588
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,760
What you said is right.

589
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
Brother Zhongfu. Come. Runrun (?)

590
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
I very much approve this point of brother Zhongfu.

591
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
People are the most important.

592
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,360
Since this publication's profits went up

593
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,000
My proposal

594
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,760
The editors' wage, author's remuneration of this publisher (?)

595
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
shouldn't it-

596
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,960
Professor Shen

597
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,080
Why do you bring up money as soon as you talk? (?)

598
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Senior Chen. That's not what I mean.

599
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
I don't care what meaning you have

600
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,040
being editor-in-chief

601
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
I have to remind everyone

602
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,720
New Youth (?)

603
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
First results (?)

604
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
We still can't have our thoughts (?)

605
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,400
used on other places.

606
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,680
Brother Zhongfu.

607
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
Brother Yinmo.

608
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,320
I believe

609
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,400
Brother Zhongfu's reminder is right.

610
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,760
To be in a successful big situation, we must have strict requirements. (?)

611
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,720
But, what brother Yinmo said is also reasonable.

612
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
See, profits rose.

613
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
Raising the editor wage, author remuneration too (?)

614
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
is not inexcusable. (?)

615
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,280
This editor wage, author's remuneration going up

616
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
The magazine's set price also goes down (?)

617
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
This was the original aspiration to implement (?)

618
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
Have the reader's principle (?)

619
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,520
Okay. We will check this principle (?)

620
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
Okay. Come. Talk about the main topic. (?)

621
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
The editorial board we have today is very important.

622
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,840
There's two matters we need to discuss over. (?)

623
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
First, starting from this period

624
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
All articles without exception will use vernacular writing (?)

625
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
This creation (?)

626
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,720
(?)

627
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
(?)

628
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
Second, starting from next period

629
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,960
New Youth magazine

630
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
will implement an editorial board responsibility system (?)

631
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
through editorial members taking turns (?)

632
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,720
every period's editing affairs (?)

633
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
editorial board's person-in-charge is Chen Duxiu.

634
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,640
Present and today's missing Huzhi (?)

635
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
are all the editorial board's official members. (?)

636
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
From this, our New Youth

637
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,040
will enter a new stage. (?)

638
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,680
Can I become a member of an outside editorial? (?)

639
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,160
I don't agree.

640
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,120
Why?

641
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,080
I already said

642
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,160
those present are all official members.

643
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
(?)

644
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
What are everyone's opinions.

645
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,480
This editorial, it must be this editorial. (?)

646
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,000
Such an enthusiastic applause

647
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,920
we can only pass this.

648
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
Next, we request this

649
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
believing himself as a member of another editorial (?)

650
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,280
to say a few words to everyone.

651
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,600
I (?)

652
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
Having a way of thinking like this (?)

653
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,960
also counts as a kind of awareness. (?)

654
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,920
In my brain repeatedly mulling (?)

655
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,000
(?)

656
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,200
(?)

657
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,560
Everyone, let's discuss

658
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
The time Zhongfu has come to Peking University has been about

659
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,000
has been one year.

660
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,880
It's been a year.

661
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,600
It's been more than a year.

662
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
One year and half.

663
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Look, a year and a half ago,

664
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,560
when Zhongfu arrived at Peking University,

665
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:06,650


666
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,520


667
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
I requested him for New Youth

668
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,000
to be brought into Peking University

669
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,920
This still went by a short time (?)

670
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
But New Youth this (?)

671
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,240
represents New Culture Movement's model magazine. (?)

672
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,320
In Beijing. Even all over the country.

673
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,680
Acting alone. (?)

674
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,280
Mr. Cai

675
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,720
I believe right now

676
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
everyone should strike while the iron is hot.

677
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,080
Set off the climax of New Culture at Peking University. (?)

678
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Then, make use of New Youth

679
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,040
acting as a model. (?)

680
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
Encite Peking University's teachers and students

681
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
(?)

682
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,360
The crucial point is to come out with more different voices. (?)

683
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,440
Okay, okay, okay. Come out with more voices. (?)

684
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,720
That... He always disrupts me. (?)

685
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,360
Have opposition, have support. (?)

686
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,800
Even have derision. (?)

687
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,480
Have New Culture be within derision and struggle

688
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,680
and grow sturdy and strong out of it.(?)

689
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,480
Okay.

690
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
Well said!

691
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,440
I heard (?)

692
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,960
this Huang Kan

693
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,050


694
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,000
has recently often with Gu Hongming and Liu Shipei (?)

695
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
gone together to Lin Shu's house to meet. (?)

696
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
Doing what?

697
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Looking into how to take down our New Youth.

698
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,760
I say, bother Deqian

699
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,880
this is nothing much. (?)

700
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
This isn't exact proof.

701
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,160
The power of New Culture is in (?)

702
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,800
the shock it causes in everyone's hearts. (?)

703
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,160
Seeing a small part. (?)

704
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,640
Okay. Just put it over here.

705
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,800
I'll talk about a matter to everyone. (?)

706
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
The other day (?)

707
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,880
I received a letter from old gentleman Lin. (?)

708
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,200
In the letter, regarding our Peking University

709
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,480
advocating and lifting the New Culture Movement, (?)

710
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
expressed strong dissatisfaction.

711
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,400
In the letter, old gentleman also used very sharp words.

712
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,080
I told him,

713
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,280
I said old gentleman Lin

714
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,120
you can come to Peking University and take a look.

715
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,560
If necessary,

716
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,080
you can also set up a lecture at the university.

717
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,920
My meaning is/intention (?)

718
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,160
let those towards New Culture Movement

719
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
masters of national culture who maintain an opposing opinion (?)

720
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,000
also have a speaking platform at Peking University.

721
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
We who engage in the New Culture Movement

722
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,480
ought to have this magnanimity.

723
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
What does everyone think?

724
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
No problem.

725
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
We are not afraid of being scolded.

726
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
We are also not afraid to argue.

727
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,160
Not right. It's not arguing.

728
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
We are not afraid of challenges.

729
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
We grow from challenges. (?)

730
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,120
Correct.

731
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,040
If it's like this,

732
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,240
I want to say

733
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,400
whether we rechoose a theme. (?)

734
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,480
Look

735
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,880
"Diary of a Madam" that Lu Xun just published

736
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,040
is already rising in society. (?)

737
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
How can vernacular writing be used as a topic to discuss (?)

738
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,240
Mr. Cai, straightforwardly at Peking University

739
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
use vernacular writing as a subject

740
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
to hold a series of lectures.

741
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,560
Have vernacular writing promoted and spread. (?)

742
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,240
Okay.

743
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,600
Right. I agree.

744
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
Yucai, you speak first.

745
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,400
What are you going to do. (?)

746
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,160
I

747
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,520
will speak about vernacular novels (?)

748
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,560
Good.

749
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,320
I want to talk about the question . (?)

750
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,280
This topic is good!

751
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,000
Okay.

752
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,960
What's your topic?

753
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,600
Not certain.

754
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,080
Allow me to deliberate.

755
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,720


756
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,840
Decide as quickly as possible.

757
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,960
Remember it. (?)

758
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,400
Okay, okay. I'll quickly decide. I'll quickly decide.

759
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,360
Zhongfu

760
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,720
I'll discuss my literature outlook. (?)

761
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:15,840
Okay.

762
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,880
I believe we have to attach importance to the effect of literature on society. (?)

763
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,920

It's not that I'm speaking highly of you all.

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,840
When it comes to translators,

794
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,080
it could be said you are China's unprecedented number one people. (?)

795
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,320
Mr. Tangsheng, you overpraise!

796
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
Compared to Mr. Tangsheng,

797
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,480
I am only ... on Mt Tai. (?)

798
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
Honorable Qinnan, you are really too modest.

799
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,800
Brother Qinnan, to say it (?)

800
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,560

These Hu Shi, Chen Duxiu are enthusiastically promoting what New Culture.

805
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,280
What do they understand about what is called New Culture? (?)

806
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,800
If I was saying it, (?)

807
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,800
only when Lin Qinnan and me Gu Hongming are together

808
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,720

00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,480
talk over a matter.

825

engaging in what vernacular writing, vernacular free verse

827
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,800
and the so-called New Culture Movement? (?)

828
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,960
It hasn't been only one or two days now.

829
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,160
Since this year, (?)

830
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,520
these people think Peking University is a stronghold. (?)

831
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,560
Seriously harming national learning tradition.

832
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,920
I know everyone here are national learning masters. (?)

833
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,440
Towards these likely bitterly detest a long time ago. (?)

834
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,120
Rotten old me is untalented. (?)

835
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,720
In my early years, I once accompanied respected teacher Wu Rulun (?)

836
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
to establish Imperial University of Peking. (?)

837
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
Really cannot bear to see the downfall of Peking University and national heritage.(?)

838
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,240
A few days ago I sent a letter to Cai Yuanpei (?)

839
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,360
Raising questions

840
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,080
Cai replied to me (?)

841
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,040
saying welcoming me to wait (?)

842
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
to launch an academic contention.

843
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
Today I requested a group of virtuous people to come (?)

844
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,400
is to seek everyone's enlightening remarks (?)

845
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,600
whether to meet with them in debate. (?)

846
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,200
Daring to ask brother Qinnan

847
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,640
why are you doing your goal like this? (?)

848
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,760
Dissatisfied sirs, all my life rotten me engaged in studies. (?)

849
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,520
?

850
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,880
Being subjects we can only vow loyalty to Great Qing's emperor.

851
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,920
When I was ten, I visited Guangxu Emperor's tomb (?)

852
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,760
to recover my Great Qing orthodox. (?)

853
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,720
Rectify and recover my three principles of Confucianism. (?)

854
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,120
If it's for reinstating Great Qing's orthodox

855
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,960
to rectify and recover the three principles of Confucianism

856
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,600
I Gu Hongming am duty bounden. (?)

857
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,440
But if it's to overturn Mr. Cai Yuanpei

858
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,440
I beg to differ. (?)

859
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,200
Moreover, firmly oppose.

860
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,120
I hold the same view with Honorable Tang.

861
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,840
I approve of returning to old ways and reinstating imperial regime (?)

862
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,880
but I will never oppose Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu.

863
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,320
My standpoint summary is different (?)

864
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,920
I approve of returning to old ways

865
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,760
but I oppose reinstating imperial monarchy

866
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
I even more oppose Chen Duxiu and that Hu Shi.

867
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,040
No matter what is said

868
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,600
returning to old ways is our common ground.

869
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,520
Then we will seek for Great Harmony. Existing a little differently. (?)

870
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,880
How is it?

871
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,560
I agree.

872
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,520
Good. Then let's discuss

873
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,280
what are we doing for magazines and lectures (?)

874
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,800
to confront them with. (?)

875
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,760
Also, member Zhang that returning to old ways proposal (?)

876
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,520
Concretely bring up the contents (?)

877
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,680
and also requesting everyone to give out some ideas. (?)

878
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,080
Respected teacher, little nephew Zhang Fengzai got a hold of some of (?)

879
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,840
Peking University's new developments.

880
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,040
Is it possible to allow him to give the great masters a little introduction.

881
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,320
Okay.

882
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,480
Know yourself, know your enemies. Can only then win every fight. (?)

883
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,560
Gentlemen. Peking University already posted announcements.

884
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,680
Starting from next week

885
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,840
Use vernacular writing as the subject (?)

886
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,360
New Culture series of lectures (?)

887
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,280
These are the lecture subjects and list of lecturers.

888
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,680
Bring it over, I'll take a look.

889
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,080
Good. Cai Yuanpei

890
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
is even going up on stage.

891
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,560
This Lu Xun is that

892
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
Zhou Shuren who wrote "Diary of Madam".

893
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,920
Precisely.

894
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
This novel's influence

895
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,120
(?)

896
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
?

897
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
?

898
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,800
I actually propose Honorable Qinnan

899
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,080
we need to go to Peking University to watch

900
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,440
and listen to their lectures.

901
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
To understand what they are selling in the end. (?)

902
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,400
After that,

903
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,920
take the appropriate steps. (?)

904
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,920
Good. Then would you please notify Cai Yuanpei

905
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,480
I want to go to Peking University to hear the lectures.

906
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,720
In this era of innovating literature, (?)

907
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,160
whatever category: aristocratic literature, classical literature (?)

908
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,680
Shanlin literature (?)

909
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,280
equally rejected (?)

910
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,880
Why?

911
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,840
(?)

912
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,560
is given our present exaggerated flattering (?)

913
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
artificial and high sounding (?)

914
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,640
is interdependent. (?)

915
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,840
that's why today we need to innovate politics. (?)

916
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,960
Have no choice but to first innovate. (?)

917
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,440
?

918
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,160
Everybody. Modern European civilization came from where (?)

919
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,480
it has its origins in the Renaissance.

920
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,400
In the future, my flourishing culture comes from where? (?)

921
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,160
I'll be as bold as to predict

922
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,360
it certainly has its origins in today's literature revolution. (?)

923
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,240
Good!

924
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,600
Very arrogant (?)

925
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,720
Gentlemen

926
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,600
Students

927
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,480
I very much approve of Mr. Zhongfu's speech.

928
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,560
Next I want to say a few sentences from my heart.

929
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,880
My viewpoint is very clear-cut. (?)

930
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,480
If China wants to develop, then we must abolish Chinese characters.

931
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,160
Arrogant.

932
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,000
Everybody, keep calm. (?)

933
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
Listen to me talk about the reason.

934
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,600
Every civilization, every nationality's written language on Earth (?)

935
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,640
most have experienced going through characters coming from shapes (?)

936
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,160
to ideographical characters

937
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,560
to phonetic characters this evolution process. (?)

938
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,040
Phonetic characters such as the Latin alphabet

939
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,640
represents a (?)

940
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,560
highest stage of written language evolution. (?)

941
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
Chinese characters are not phonetic

942
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,000
rather are characters that represent shape and meaning (?)

943
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
as a result, we have to abolish it.

944
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,320
You are talking rubbish. (?)

945
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,680
Mr. Qian

946
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,360
If Chinese characters are abolished, then what do we use. (?)

947
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,280
Yeah. What do we use?

948
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,280
Good question!

949
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,200
Writing (?)

950
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
is nothing more than a language of symbolizing objects. (?)

951
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,720
We should adopt a kind of fully simple grammar (?)

952
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,760
Neat pronunciation, written language of excellent quality. (?)

953
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,440
esperanto (?)

954
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,400
It is esperanto. (?)

955
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,880
How come there isn't our own culture? (?)

956
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,120
Professor Qian

957
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,280
I think your point of view is truly absurd.

958
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
If we follow Professor Qian's way (?)

959
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,440
my understanding must be

960
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
to have all of us Chinese people

961
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
learn anew a language from a foreign country

962
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,440
Why can't it be anyways? (?)

963
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,240
I think he is not doing New Culture (?)

964
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
he is destroying culture. (?)

965
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,560
Even more so wants to destroy my race!

966
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,760
Right!

967
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,200
Brother Hangyan (?)

968
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,440
if we don't add a fierce medicine, then how is China going to move forward? (?)

969
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
Forget one's roots! (?)

970
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,760
Beat him to death! (?)

971
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
I must insist on my own point of view.

972
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,680
This is how I'm thinking. (?)

973
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
Those of you sitting, which one of you isn't Chinese.

974
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,880
I am also Chinese.

975
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,840
I love my country.

976
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,840
I believe carrying out New Culture (?)

977
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,440
we need to start from abolishing Chinese characters.

978
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,480
Qian Xuantong (?)

979
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
My (?) China

980
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,160
5000 years of Chinese history. (?)

981
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,200
The characters ancestors left behind. How can it be abolished. (?)

982
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,960
You forget your roots. (?)

983
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,000
Right.

984
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
Chen Zhongfu

985
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,520
Qian Xuantong is your New Youth's

986
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,960
fellow editor. (?)

987
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,280
Abolishing Chinese characters

988
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,280
is the result you want from New Culture? (?)

989
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,040
You must give a statement. (?)

990
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,800
Right! Give a statement! (?)

991
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,200
I very much can understand

992
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,560
Professor Qian's abolishing Chinese characters argument (?)

993
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,040
a heart concerned for Chinese culture. (?)

994
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,640
But

995
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,840
Regarding abolishing Chinese characters, this decision

996
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,760
I don't agree at all.

997
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,560
So, I refrain from saying my opinions.

998
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,120
?

999
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,120
Talking rubbish.

1000
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
Strike back. (?)

1001
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,080
Must absolutely not allow them to recklessly act like this. (?)

1002
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,400
Let me see. I'll take the lead. (?)

1003
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,840
Give Hu Shi, that child, a show of strength. (?)

1004
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,080
Everyone says that Mr. Hu Shi has karma with women. (?)

1005
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,440
Look, so many people came.

1006
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,680
Seeing it today, sure enough a justified reputation. (?)

1007
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,440
Did you guys know?

1008
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,360
His young wife is a bounded feet peasant woman (?)

1009
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,880
can't understand classical Chinese writing. (?)

1010
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,560
That can't be? (?)

1011
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,600
I only just heard it before. (?)

1012
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,760
Isn't his young wife a girl from a wealthy family who could read. (?)

1013
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,360
I also heard this. Isn't it. (?)

1014
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,840
He arrived!

1015
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,800
Mr. Hu Shi came

1016
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
Ladies

1017
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,720
Gentlemen

1018
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,560
Happy spring. (?)

1019
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,840
?

1020
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,600
Today the topic I'm speaking about is

1021
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
"Vernacular Writing vs Vernacular Free Verse".

1022
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,040
Lots of friends ask me

1023
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,680
why do you Hu Shi insist on advocating for vernacular writing

1024
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,600
and abandon the tradition of classical Chinese writing. (?)

1025
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,600
My answer is

1026
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,680
First, that day's classical Chinese writing (?)

1027
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,240
Is a kind of half-dead kind of writing.

1028
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Ordinary people are unable to understand what they see, even more what they hear. (?)

1029
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,320
Second, the vernacular writing we are advocating today

1030
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,080
is a kind of living writing. (?)

1031
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:34,720
Not at all vulgar.

1032
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,040


1033
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,200


1034
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,290


1035
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,450


1036
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,080
Third, vernacular is not only not vulgar

1037
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,320


1038
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,000


1039
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
it is also very elegant, practical.

1040
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,080
Because vernacular writing

1041
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,800
is a kind of very expressful language. (?)

1042
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,000
We know

1043
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,720
expressing meaning is a language's main function. (?)

1044
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,920
Language that doesn't express is not beautiful. (?)

1045
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,440
For example,

1046
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,440
Mr. Lu Xun's novel "Diary of a Madam"

1047
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,200
there is writing like this inside (?)

1048
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,520
Old man Zhao... (?)

1049
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,520
(?)

1050
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,760
This section is simple, lively, graceful and vivid. (?)

1051
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,600
Classical Chinese writing is hard to go for. (?)

1052
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,040
Saying it like this

1053
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,840
don't know if those present agree? (?)

1054
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,960
Agree!

1055
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,280
Agree! Good!

1056
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,080
Good!

1057
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,920
Professor Hu's point of view

1058
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,680
Forgive me for begging to differ (?)

1059
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,280
I remember professor Hu Shi just now talked about path (?)

1060
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,160
vernacular writing compared to classical Chinese writing is simplified complicated material. (?)

1061
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,520
More convenient and fast, effective

1062
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,240
These are not facts (?)
