00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,520
Now, let us invite Mao Zedong

455
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,760
to read "The Constitution of the Xinmin Society".

456
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,200
Dear members,

457
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,280
our organization

458
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,520
is born from the New Culture Movement.

459
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,640
Its specialty

460
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,840
is its spirit.

461
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,720
There is only one element,

462
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,080
which is "New".

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,040
Hence,

464
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,240
we will need to use new ways of thinking,

465
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,440
new cultures,

466
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,320
new theories

467
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,080
to equip our members' thoughts,

468
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,080
change our morals for the better,

469
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,080
and improve our knowledge

470
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,640
This is our organization's intention

471
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,760
and responsibility.

472
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,400
Hence,

473
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
I believe our organization's purpose

474
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
is to spark innovations in education,

475
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
strengthen character,

476
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
improve people's way of thinking and customs.

477
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,640
Therefore,

478
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,360
The organization stipulates that

479
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,680
every member must accomplish the following:

480
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,800
first, to not be hypocritical;

481
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,320
second, to not be lazy;

482
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,840
third, to not be wasteful;

483
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,960
fourth, to not gamble;

484
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,480
fifth, to not engage in prostitution.

485
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,600
I say,

486
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
isn't this a little strict?

487
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,040
It's too harsh.

488
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320
I agree with Runzhi.

489
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,000
How is this strict? It should be like this.

490
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
It should be like this!

491
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,320
Everyone please remain silent!

492
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,320
Now we will take a vote on the Constitution,

493
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
If you agree please raise your hand.

494
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,720
The vote has passed.

495
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,840
Dear members,

496
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
according to the Constitution,

497
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,520
the Xinmin Society will require a director-general,

498
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
and two secretaries.

499
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
The organizing committee has taken into account everyone's opinions.

500
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
We recommend Xiao Zisheng,

501
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,520
as he has completed his studies

502
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
and graduated.

503
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920
He will have sufficient time

504
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,680
to manage the organization's affairs.

505
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,440
We recommend him to be our Director-General

506
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,640
We recommend Mao Zedong

507
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,320
and Chen Shunong as secretaries.

508
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
Those who agree please raise your hand.

509
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,840
Unanimous vote!

510
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
I am grateful for everyone's trust.

511
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
But recently I am in talks to study abroad in France.

512
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,680
Runzhi,

513
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
the organization's affairs

514
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
will need your help.

515
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,040
It is my duty.

516
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,840
I hope to be able to help everyone.

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,320
Good.

518
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,320
I believe

519
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
our members participating in the work-study program in France

520
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,680
is very necessary.

521
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
It is also one of our organization's

522
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
main jobs.

523
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,840
Runzhi,

524
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,120
this matter

525
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,160
needs your help.

526
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,800
Even though

527
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
I am not too interested in studying abroad in France,

528
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,640
but I still hope

529
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,160
to be able to contribute to the organization.

530
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,520
Additionally,

531
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
I heard from Mr. Yang Changji

532
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,160
that Cai Yuanpei and others

533
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,280
will be in Beijing,

534
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
organizing many preparatory programs for

535
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,000
students participating in work-study programs in France.

536
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,960
I want to

537
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,000
write a letter to Mr. Yang

538
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,280
and ask for his help.

539
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,320
This is excellent!

540
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,640
Runzhi.

541
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,280
The work-study program in France is a good thing.

542
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
You must work hard on it.

543
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,800
Members,

544
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,760
if it were possible,

545
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
I, an old lady, would like to participate in the work study program as well

546
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,720
to have different experiences

547
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,240
and learn new things.

548
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,120
Great!

549
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,840
Welcome!

550
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,920
We welcome you to apply!

551

April 1918

552
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,560
Mao Zedong,

553
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,760
Cai Hesen,

554
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,120
He Shuheng and others

555
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
founded the Xinmin Society in Changsha.

556
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
This part of the New Culture Movement,

557
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,080
founded in Changsha,

558
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
was a revolutionary organization that focused on the youth and students.

559
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,960
Mao Zedong thus embarked

560
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,400
on the revolutionary road of seeking the truth of saving the country.

561
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:37,722
[New Youth Editorial Office]

562
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,880
Eating mankind, eating mankind!

563
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,320
These are well written!

564
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,360
Everyone!

565
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,320
Wait,

566
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,600
Brother Zhongfu, today,

567
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
you stand here and tell everyone.

568
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
We will then sit here

569
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
and appreciate Brother Zhongfu's speech.

570
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,360
Alright.

571
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
You still understand my feelings.

572
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
Thanks to everyone's hardwork,

573
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,240
our "New Youth" magazine has already become

574
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,560
the most influential publication in China.

575
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
Great!

576
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,920
Especially this week's edition,

577
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
Lu Xun's vernacular essay

578
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,360
"A Madman's Diary",

579
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,720
has attracted attention from many people.

580
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,240
It can be said that

581
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,240
this is the cornerstone of the New Culture Movement.

582
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,440
Great, Brother Zhongfu!

583
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,560
What did I tell you?

584
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,480
To make "New Youth" popular, you have to come to Beijing.

585
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,760
Come down.

586
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,480
Come down and speak.

587
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,680
Let me just add.

588
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,720
Alright, please continue.

589
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,520
Let me tell you.

590
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,800
The location is definitely important,

591
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,360
but the most important element

592
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,640
is still people.

593
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,760
You are right.

594
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
Brother Zhongfu, please have a drink.

595
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
I agree with Brother Zhongfu's opinion.

596
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
The power of man is most important.

597
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,360
Since this edition is so popular,

598
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,000
I suggest

599
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,760
royalties for the authors.

600
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
Should we?

601
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,960
Professor Shen,

602
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,080
why do you bring up the topic of money?

603
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Dean Chen, that's not what I meant.

604
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
I don't care what you mean.

605
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,040
As the chief editor,

606
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
I want to remind everyone

607
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,720
the "New Youth" revolution

608
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
is just beginning.

609
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
We still need to work hard on it

610
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,400
and should not think about other matters first.

611
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,680
Brother Zhongfu,

612
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
brother Yinmo,

613
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,320
I personally believe

614
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,400
Brother Zhongfu's reminder is timely.

615
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,760
If we want to accomplish great things, we need to have high standards.

616
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,720
But Brother Yinmo has a point as well.

617
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
Profits have increased,

618
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
increasing royalties for the authors

619
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
is not unreasonable.

620
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,280
If we increase the royalties,

621
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
we will decrease the price of the magazines.

622
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
These are the values that our publication

623
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
wants the reader to know.

624
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,520
Alright, let us follow this principle.

625
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
Back to serious matters,

626
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
our editorial meeting today is very important.

627
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,840
We have two matters we need to discuss.

628
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
First, starting from this edition,

629
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
all essays must be written in vernacular Chinese.

630
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
This first publication

631
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,720
will serve as the benchmark of the New Culture Movement

632
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
to promote to the rest of society.

633
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
Second, from the next publication onwards

634
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,960
the "New Youth" magazine's

635
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
editorial committee

636
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
will be managed by a rotation of editors.

637
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,720
The editorial committee of every publication

638
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
will be managed by Chen Duxiu

639
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,640
and Shizhi, who is not present today,

640
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
is a member of the editorial committee.

641
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
Hence, our "New Youth" magazine

642
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,040
will enter a new phase.

643
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,680
Can I be an external member of the editorial committee?

644
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,160
I don't agree.

645
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,120
Why?

646
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,080
I just said,

647
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,160
everyone here is a formal member.

648
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
How do you become an external editor?

649
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
What does everyone think?

650
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,480
Editors should be internal members.

651
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,000
That's applause.

652
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,920
Let this pass then.

653
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
We will then invite

654
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
this so-called external editor to

655
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,280
share some insights with us.

656
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,600
For me, I recently

657
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
had this thought,

658
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,960
which can be considering an understanding,

659
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,920
has been stewing in my mind for quite some time.

660
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,000
I will tell it to the various professors

661
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,200
and gentlemen here

662
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,560
and let everyone discuss it.

663
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
Zhongfu has arrived in Peking University for

664
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,000
about a year.

665
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,880
It's been a year.

666
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,600
More than a year.

667
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
A year and a half.

668
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
You see, in this one year and a half,

669
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,520
Zhongfu has been in Peking University.

670
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
I have asked him to bring "New Youth" with him

671
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,000
to Peking University.

672
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,920
Such a short time has passed,

673
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
but "New Youth"

674
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,240
now represents the New Culture Movement

675
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,320
in Beijing, and even the whole of China.

676
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,680
It is the one and only magazine.

677
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,280
Mr. Cai,

678
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,720
I believe now,

679
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
we should all seize the opportunity

680
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,080
and garner support for the New Culture Movement in Peking University.

681
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Then make use of "New Youth"

682
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,040
as a benchmark

683
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
to motivate Peking University's students and teachers

684
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
to start-up a few more magazines.

685
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,360
The key is to publish different viewpoints.

686
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,440
Good, more viewpoints.

687
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,720
Well, he's always bothering me.

688
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,360
Having opposing and supportive viewpoints,

689
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,800
even insulting ones,

690
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,480
allows the New Culture Movement

691
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,680
to be strengthened by fighting and dissent.

692
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,480
Good.

693
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
Well said.

694
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,440
I say,

695
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,040
this Huang Kan,

696
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,000
and recently with Gu Hongming and Liu Shipei,

697
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
have always visited Lin Shu's residence.

698
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
What are they doing?

699
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
They are discussing on how to refute "New Youth".

700
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,760
Brother Deqian,

701
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,880
this isn't much.

702
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
This precisely proves

703
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,160
the power of the New Culture Movement.

704
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,800
It is able to stir up feelings in everyone.

705
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,160
This is good.

706
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,640
Alright, just leave it with me.

707
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,800
Let me tell everyone.

708
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
The day before yesterday,

709
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,880
I received a letter from Mr. Lin.

710
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,200
He mentioned in his letter his view on Peking University's

711
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,480
promotion of the New Culture Movement

712
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
and expressed his strong disagreement.

713
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,400
Mr. Lin's words were incisive.

714
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,080
I told him,

715
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,280
I said, Mr. Lin,

716
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,120
you can come to Peking University to take a look.

717
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,560
If it's necessary,

718
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,080
you can host a seminar in Peking University.

719
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,920
What I meant is

720
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,160
to allow those that

721
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
disagree and agree with the New Culture Movement

722
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,000
to voice their views in Peking University.

723
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
As proponents of the New Culture Movement,

724
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,480
we should be magnimous.

725
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
What does everyone think?

726
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
No problem.

727
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
We are not afraid of insults.

728
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
We are not afraid of fights.

729
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,160
No, not fights.

730
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
We are not afraid of challenges.

731
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
We will grow through facing adversity.

732
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,120
Exactly!

733
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,040
If this is the case,

734
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,240
I want to say,

735
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,400
should we choose a theme?

736
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,480
You see,

737
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,880
Lu Xun just published his "A Madman's Diary".

738
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,040
It has already attracted the attention of society

739
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
with Vernacular Chinese as the subject of discussion.

740
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,240
Mr. Cai, we might as well set

741
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
the theme of Vernacular Chinese

742
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
and organise a series of talks

743
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,560
to promote the usage of Vernacular Chinese.

744
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,240
Good.

745
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,600
I agree.

746
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
Yucai, what do you say?

747
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,400
What do you think?

748
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,160
I...

749
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,520
I will just talk about books written in Vernacular Chinese.

750
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,560
Good.

751
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,320
I will talk about the issue of China's written script.

752
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,280
This is a good topic!

753
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,000
Good!

754
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,960
What topic have you chosen?

755
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,600
I haven't decided.

756
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
Let me think aboout it.

757
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,840
Quickly think about it.

758
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,960
Write it down.

759
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,400
Alright, I will quickly think about it.

760
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,360
Zhongfu,

761
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,720
I will talk about my philosophical opinion.

762
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:15,840
Alright.

763
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,880
I believe we need to value the importance of philosophy in society,

764
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,920
emphasize the importance of philosophy in society.

765
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,440
Vernacular Language Lecture Series.

766
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,720

Fourth seminar, Hu Shi:

00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,600

This is excellent!

Look!

780
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,720
Mr. Zhongfu and Mr. Shouchang have already begun!

781
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,760
I definitely will attend.

782
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,680
Especially Mr. Chen's "On the Literary Revolution"

783
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah!

784
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,040
Everyone is a learned person in Peking University.

785
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,240


786
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,480

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,560


801
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,640


802
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,160


803
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,320

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,040


805
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,280

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,800

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,720

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720


810
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,240


811
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,600


812
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,920


813
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,560


814
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,560


815
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,800


816
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,160

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,560

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,200

00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,480

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,800

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,920

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200


837
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200


838
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,240


839
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,360


840
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,080
