[Episode Fifteen]

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,480
As for this Socialist country you just mentioned,
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,120
does it mean that people no longer exploit other people
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,520
and no one bullies us poor people?

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,800
Exactly, that's what it means.
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,640
Then do we have the bearded man you mentioned

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,160
and people like Lenin

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,440
in China?

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
If so, let's go find him!

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,160
Don't worry, everybody.

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
Now a group of people are on their way to look for him.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
You are the bearded man!

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,600
You are the bearded one!

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,880
The dumpling wrapper you rolled out are too thick.

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
Take a seat, everybody!

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,640
Go ahead, the meal is ready!

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,200
Come on guys, it's time to eat!

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,440
(The animation depicts people celebrating Chinese Lunar New Year)

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,200
Happy Lunar New Year, Sir!

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,880
Best wishes for the New Year!

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,160
Best wishes!

00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
Zimei, Henian  

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,120
One for each of you.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,120
Be healthy and happy!

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,120
Thank you, Mr. Shouchang!

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,400
You're welcome!

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,280
The Peking University Library in the Red Building

30
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,880
is organizing a holiday break reading club.

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,480
The sessions will begin after Jan 5th of the Lunar Calendar.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,240
Since you three are not only all book worms,

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,840
but also the leaders

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
of the "New Youth" distribution station in Beijing,
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,040
you can gather the students

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
to study and work on the distribution at the same time.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,720
How about that? What do you say?

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm in!
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,040
I'm going to be an active member!

40
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,880
I was just worried about potential channels for distribution of "New Youth".

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
If that's the case, we're going to be colleagues again!

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,160
Colleagues indeed!

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,560
Shouchang, you're really good at this!

44
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
You gathered up all the bright young minds here.

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,680
That's not why we're here, brother Zhongfu.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,520
We're here to deliver New Year's greetings to you,

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
and at the same time,

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,640
these students wish to seek your advice on quite a few matters.

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,840
What type of matters?

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,240
Mr. Zhongfu,

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,760
nowadays the New Culture Movement is becoming

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
the center of public discussion in the whole society.

53
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,840
When we are talking about it with our classmates,

54
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,840
we often come across controversial issues.
[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Peking University student]

55
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,760
So we especially wish that 

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,520
you could give us a seminar in the reading club.

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
What kind of controversial issues?

58
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,400
For example, what's the relationship between

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
promoting New Culture and ideological enlightenment 

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
and transforming national character?

61
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,280
Also, what are the manifestations of 

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,720
the limitations of traditional culture?

63
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
What's the relationship between

64
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
promoting New Culture and

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
channeling Western theories and ideologies?

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
And also, what approaches should be taken

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,120
in promoting New Culture?

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,000
Exactly!

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
All of these are big questions

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
targeting complex issues!

71
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,080
I, Chen Duxiu, don't have the capacity to answer.

72
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
Nor can I prescribe this panacea. 

73
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,000
But, anyway, Peking University will soon hold 

74
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
a New Culture-centered Lecture series, after the school starts.

75
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
Chancellor Cai will lead

76
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
all the principle figures of New Culture Movement 

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,280
to converge by then.

78
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,040
I hope all of you guys will actively participate.

79
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,160
Great! Terrific!

80
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,600
Alright guys, 

81
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
let's head in first. It's too cold outside.

82
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
Come in please.

83
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,680
Come in.

84
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Please.

85
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,760
Shouchang,

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,400
after you, Sir.

87
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,160
Sir,

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,600
Sir,

89
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,880
where do you think we should hang this?

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,600
Right.

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
Why do you want this be hung?

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
This is for celebrating the founding of our reading club.

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,240
Students,

94
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
please all come over here for a sec.

95
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,720
I'd like to ask you guys,

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,680
what do you think of our reading club?

97
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
The reading club offers us a platform to communicate our thoughts,

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,040
and to elevate our level of thinking.

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
The reading club also enables us to 

100
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
take the discussion of social issues to a deeper level,

101
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
and then to apply our collective wisdom 

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,320
to proposing better solutions.

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,360
Anything else?

104
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,840
I think both of you made great points here.

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
But I also believe

106
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
our reading club should not merely

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,200
scratch the surface of things at the theoretical level.

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Spreading the truth, enlightening our people 

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
and thus transforming the whole society, 

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
I believe this should be our highest mission.

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
And most importantly, this mission requires 

112
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
devotion of heart and soul of generations of people.

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
It may even be an arduous endeavor that

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
require hundreds of years of such devotion.

115
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
In front of such a grand endeavor, 

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
I don't think any type of formality matters. 

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
Why is that?

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
Because it is only through 

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,480
our relentless efforts

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
can we build our road to success. 

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
Therefore, I think

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
our reading club 

123
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,360
should be plain and honest.

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm not sure if you guys

125
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
would agree with what I just said.

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
Agreed.

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
I sincerely hope that all of you

128
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
will be engrossed in reading and thinking,

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
taking each and every solid step towards our common goal.

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
We not only have to routinize the activities of our reading club,

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
but also need to popularize it

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
and make it accessible to the general public.

133
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
Do you all have that confidence?

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,920
Yes, we do!

135
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Shall we put this aside?

136
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,440
Sure.

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Let's all get back to work.

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
Zhongxie, let's continue.

139
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
Let's shelf the books we just registered.

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,480
Okay.

141
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,920
Dear students,

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
the topic for our reading club discussion today is

143
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,040
monthly commentary on current affairs.

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,240
It will be held in two parts,

145
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
in the first part, Chen Yannian 

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,480
will offer us an overview on the

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,920
domestic and international situations in the recent month;

148
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
in the second part, we will have a free discussion.

149
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,480
Now please welcome Chen Yannian.

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,920
Dear students,

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
the domestic and international situation in the last month

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
can be captured by four words:

153
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
crisis-ridden, intricate and confusing.

154
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
Let's begin with the domestic situation.

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,080
First,

156
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,880
Duan Qirui's Anhui Clique and Feng Guozhang's Zhili Clique
(mutually hostile factions that split from Beiyang Government during the Warlord Era)

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
were having a nasty fight.

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
After Duan Qirui gained an upper hand,

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,280
he decided to resume his old activity, 

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,920
and is now gathering armed forces to suppress the Southern Government.

161
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,720
Second, the Southern Government is facing endless internal strifes.

162
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Sun Yat-sen is losing his power to others.

163
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
Third, Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,560
seized the 100,000 riffles 

165
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,120
ordered by Republic of China Army (ROCA) from Japan,

166
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
and is now drastically strengthened.

167
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,000
Internationally,

168
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,760
first, Russia led by Lenin 

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,280
was forced to sign the 

170
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,960
 “Treaty of Brest-Litovsk” with Germany 

171
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
to withdraw from the World War

172
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,160
so as to gain important breathing time for the nation.

173
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Second, the European theater is in utter chaos.

174
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,840
The German troops started to...

175
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,400
Yannian,

176
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm sorry to interrupt. 

177
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,480
Chancellor Cai is here to visit our club.

178
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,080
Greetings, Sir.

179
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,440
Greetings, everybody.

180
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
Please sit down.
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, Chancellor of Peking University]

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,120
You're doing an impressive job!

182
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,240
You showed comprehensive understanding of 

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
the domestic and international situations in the past month.

184
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,320
And your presentation is very clear.

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,600
Impressive!

186
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
Sir, you flatter me.

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,200
These are all based on information I retrieved from Peking University Library.

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
The sources are easily accessible.

189
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
All I did was to organize them a little bit.

190
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
The organization of information is actually an essential part.

191
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Effective organization takes painstaking investigation and through examination

192
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,880
to extract and deliver more accurate information for the audience.

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,200
You guys here are listening with 

194
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
great concentration and interest.

195
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
How harmonious!

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Mr. Cai,

197
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,360
do you know why they're all laughing?

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
You have only seen the harmonious side of our club.

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,880
Yet, you haven't experienced

200
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,800
their "aggressive" arguments.

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,720
What do they argue about?

202
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,320
It's because everybody has different beliefs here.

203
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,520
Some believe in Communism,

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
others in Anarchism, 

205
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,360
stills others in Pragmatism.

206
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,720
Everybody comes with good intentions, 

207
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
but they soon get into arguments as the discussion deepens.

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
In fact, arguments are not necessarily bad.

209
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,800
If we view it from the long course of human history, 

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
in the process of human development

211
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,200
we seek survival and prosperity.

212
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,840
The beliefs emerged 

213
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,560
and the routes that were taken,

214
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,120
all of them were outcomes of arguments.

215
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,720
Right?

216
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,200
Our visit to your club today

217
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,920
is to extend out support to you.

218
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Feel free to me if you guys encounter any difficulties.

219
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,520
Please resume.

220
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,480
Thank you, Sir.

221
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Speaking of...

222
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
Secondly, the European theater is in utter chaos.

223
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,520
The German troops started 

224
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,120
massive attacks at the Western Front,

225
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,600
hoping to defeat Britain and France 

226
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,240
and reverse the situation

227
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,440
in the summer of 1918

228
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,720
before the U.S. arrives at Europe.

229
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,040
Third, on Jan 8th,

230
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,400
the U.S. President Wilson outlined the "Fourteen Points" 

231
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
in the speech on war aims and peace terms to the U.S. Congress.

232
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,760
For the first time,

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,520
the idea of a League of Nations was proposed.

234
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
The designated goal of such a league is to

235
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,560
afford mutual guarantees of 

236
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
political independence and territorial integrity

237
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
to great and small states alike.

238
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,120
For more than two months,

239
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Wilson's Principles for Peace has continued to influence.

240
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,960
[Zhou Shuren (Lu Xun), styled Yucai, civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

241
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Yucai!

242
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
What's up, Yucai?

243
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,880
Yucai?

244
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,080
What's wrong?

245
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,320
What happened?

246
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,080
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Professor at Peking University]
Is it done?

247
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
Is it?!

248
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
This means, I'm holding

249
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,960
the manuscript of the very first

250
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
 modern vernacular novel in China.

251
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,520
And I will be its very first reader.

252
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,480
You know what...

253
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
if you had told me that you're having this successful completion today,

254
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
I would have brought a camera

255
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
to document this monumental moment in history!

256
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,240
"A Madman's Diary"

257
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
Two brothers, 

258
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
whose names I shall keep secret here,

259
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,160
Yucai,

260
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
you haven't put your name down yet.

261
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Yucai,

262
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
who is the "father" to this "child"?

263
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
(Writing down "鲁迅" Lu Xun)

264
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,800
Zhou Shuren,

265
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
from now on will become Lu Xun. 

266
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,920
Lu - Xun.

267
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,120
Lu - Xun...

268
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,400
In April 1918,

269
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,840
Lu Xun completed his vernacular diary-formed novel

270
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,800
"A Madman's Diary".

271
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
It was the first modern vernacular novel in China.

272
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
Like a heavy bomb, it was launched by the New Culture Movement 

273
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,080
towards feudal ethics.

274
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,280
It drastically expanded the influence of Literary Revolution.

275
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,360
It bears long-lasting significance 

276
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
in Chinese History of Modern literature 

277
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
as well as Chinese Modern Cultural History. 

278
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,760
It's done!

279
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,040
It's done!

280
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,400
My brother is someone who eats people!

281
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I am the brother of someone who eats people!

282
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
I myself will be eaten by people, 

283
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,720
yet I am still the brother of someone who eats people!

284
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,720
Brother Zhongfu,

285
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,520
Shouchang, hurry,

286
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,320
I have another paragraph to share!

287
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,800
Let me tell you guys,

288
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,240
I really enjoy this part,

289
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,600
listen to this,

290
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
Little sister was eaten by her older brother;

291
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,960
whether my mother knew or not,

292
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,720
I had no way of knowing.

293
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
It's not certain that, unwittingly,

294
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
I did not eat a few pieces of my little sister's flesh;

295
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,040
and now it is my turn,

296
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,840
Me, with a four thousand year history of eating people...

297
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
although at the time I didn't know,

298
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,840
I now understand;

299
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
it is hard to face real humans!

300
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,560
Each word stabs the heart!

301
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
Reading Yucai's novel

302
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
feels like an invisible fist

303
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,960
pounding abruptly on my chest.

304
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
Especially this last paragraph,

305
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
he wrote "children who have not yet eaten people may still exist..."

306
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,640
Right!

307
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,080
To whom is he directing this question to?

308
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,360
Immediately after that he wrote

309
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
"save the children..."

310
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,320
Exactly!

311
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,960
Indignant and profound!

312
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
Mr. Cai, those very sentences!

313
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Perceptive! Radical! 

314
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,200
Radical!

315
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,080
Here, here,

316
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
let me tell you which part I like the best.

317
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,960
When I open up a history book,

318
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
the history is undated,

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,600
and scrawled across every page

320
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,920
are a few words about compassion, duty, propriety and integrity.

321
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
As I couldn't sleep anyway, 

322
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,480
I read closely for half the night,

323
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,760
and only then from the seams of the letters could I see

324
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
the two words that it was packed full of: 

325
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
"Eat people"!

326
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,280
A Madman's Diary!

327
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,400
Lu Xun, Yucai!

328
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,720
Yucai has real talent, I have said this a long time ago!

329
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,640
See how zealous he is.

330
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
I should not just be knocking on the desk here.

331
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,960
We should have Yucai come over,

332
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,480
I have to kiss him in person!

333
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,080
I'll tell you what,

334
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,680
what I'm feeling right now

335
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,080
is just like when I first read 

336
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,680
"The Discrimination and Enlightenment of Literature Improvement" by Hu Shi.

337
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
The fire in my heart is rekindled!

338
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,280
Yucai,

339
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,080
he has extremely keen sight.

340
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,840
This novel of his,

341
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,520
and its criticism of national characters

342
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
its exposing of feudal ethics

343
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
are utterly incisive! 

344
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,880
Mr. Cai,

345
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,080
it's indeed a good piece of work.

346
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,440
But is it far too radical?

347
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
That's exactly what we need!

348
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,440
Indeed!

349
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,720
Towards this rotten society, 

350
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,040
drastic measures are exactly what we need!

351
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,240
Shizhi,

352
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,240
are you worried that it's going to overshadow

353
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,880
your contributions in promoting vernacular literature?  

354
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,440
I propose

355
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,520
we publish this in the upcoming issue of "New Youth"!

356
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,560
I agree!

357
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,200
Agreed!

358
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,080
Agreed!

359
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,960
Agreed!

360
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,840
Awesome!
