00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,760
Also, please give us an idea

904
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,520
of what Legislator Zhang's proposal to reinstate the old ways specifically mentions,

905
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,680
and also I request everyone to give out some ideas.

906
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,080
Beloved mentor, little nephew Zhang Fengzai got a hold of some of

907
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,840
Peking University's new developments.

908
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,040
Is it possible to allow him to give the great masters a little introduction?

909
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,320
Okay.

910
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,480
Know yourself, know your enemies. Only then can you win every fight.

911
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,560
Gentlemen. Peking University have posted notices.

912
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,680
Starting from next week,

913
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,840
a series of lectures on New Culture

914
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,360
with the theme of vernacular Chinese will be held.

915
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,280
These are the lecture subjects and list of lecturers.

916
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,680
Bring it over, I'll take a look.

917
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,080
Good. Cai Yuanpei

918
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
is even going up on stage.

919
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,560
This Lu Xun is that

920
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
Zhou Shuren who wrote "A Madman's Diary".

921
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,920
Precisely.

922
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
The influence of this novel

923
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,120
is endlessly wicked.

924
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
"The Danzi people are like birds and beasts,

925
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
How could we be of the same herd?"

926
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,800
I actually propose to the Honorable Qinnan,

927
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,080
we need to go to Peking University to watch

928
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,440
and listen to their lectures

929
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
to understand what they are selling in the end.

930
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,400
After that,

931
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,920
we take the appropriate steps.

932
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,920
Good. Then would you please notify Cai Yuanpei,

933
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,480
I want to go to Peking University to hear the lectures.

934
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,720
In this era of literary innovation,

935
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,160
All aristocratic literature, classical literature

936
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,680
and Shanlin literature
(pastoral literature, lit. mountain literature)

937
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,280
are equally rejected.

938
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,880
Why?

939
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,840
These three types of literature,

940
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,560
our present exaggerated flattery,

941
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
hypocrisy and profanity

942
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,640
are interdependent.

943
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,840
Therefore, if we want to reform politics today,

944
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,960
we have to first reform

945
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,440
the literature that has been entrenched in the political spirit.

946
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,160
Ladies and gentlemen, where did modern European civilization originate?

947
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,480
It originated from the Renaissance.

948
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,400
In the future, where will our cultural prosperity originate?

949
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,160
I'll be as bold as to predict

950
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,360
it certainly has its origins in today's literary revolution.

951
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,240
Good!

952
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,600
Very arrogant.

953
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,720
Gentlemen!

954
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,600
Students!

955
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,480
I very much approve of Mr. Zhongfu's speech.

956
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,560
Next, I want to say a few sentences from my heart.

957
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,880
My viewpoint is clear.

958
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,480
If China wants to develop, then we must abolish Chinese characters.

959
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,160
Arrogant.

960
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,000
Everybody, keep calm.

961
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
Listen to me talk about the reason.

962
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,600
Every civilization, every nation's written language on Earth

963
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,640
have experienced the transition of characters coming from shapes

964
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,160
to ideographical characters

965
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,560
to phonetic characters in this evolutionary process.

966
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,040
Phonetic characters, such as in the Latin alphabet,

967
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,640
represents a

968
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,560
higher stage in the evolution of written language.

969
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
Chinese characters are not phonetic,

970
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,000
but rather are characters that represent shape and meaning.

971
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
As a result, we have to abolish it.

972
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,320
You are talking rubbish!

973
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,680
Mr. Qian,

974
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,360
if Chinese characters are abolished, then what do we use?

975
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,280
Yeah. What do we use?

976
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,280
Good question!

977
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,200
Writing

978
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
is nothing more than a language of symbolizing objects.

979
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,720
We should adopt a written language of fully simple grammar

980
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,760
with neat pronunciation, and of excellent quality.

981
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,440
Esperanto.

982
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,400
It is the international language.

983
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,031
Why don't we use our own culture?

984
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:40,880
Not using our own culture!

985
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,120
Professor Qian,

986
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,280
I think your point of view is truly absurd.

987
00:36:48,352 --> 00:36:49,768
Yeah! Absurd!

988
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
If we follow Professor Qian's argument,

989
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,440
my understanding is

990
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
to have all of us Chinese people

991
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
learn anew a language from a foreign country.

992
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,440
Why can't it be?

993
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,240
I think he is not doing New Culture

994
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
he is destroying culture!

995
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,560
Even more so wants to destroy my race!

996
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,760
Right!

997
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,200
Brother Xingyan!

998
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,440
If we don't apply fierce medicine, then how is China going to move forward?

999
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
Forgetting one's roots!

1000
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,760
Beat him to death!

1001
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
I must insist on my own point of view!

1002
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,680
This is my opinion!

1003
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
Those of you sitting, which one of you isn't Chinese.

1004
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,880
I am also Chinese.

1005
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,840
I love my country.

1006
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,840
I believe, in order to carry out New Culture,

1007
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,440
we need to start from abolishing Chinese characters.

1008
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,480
Qian Xuantong!

1009
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
My vast China

1010
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,160
with 5000 years of Chinese history,

1011
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,200
how can the characters that the ancestors left behind be abolished?

1012
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,960
You forget your roots! You advocate for national chaos and bad habits!

1013
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,160
Yeah!

1014
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,000
Chen Zhongfu!

1015
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
Qian Xuantong is your "New Youth"'s

1016
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,520
fellow editor.

1017
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,960
Is abolishing Chinese characters

1018
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,280
the result you want from New Culture?

1019
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,280
You must give a statement.

1020
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,040
Right! Give a statement!

1021
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,800
Give a statement!

1022
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,200
I can very much understand

1023
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,560
Professor Qian's argument for abolishing Chinese characters,

1024
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,040
through a heart concerned for Chinese culture.

1025
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,640
But,

1026
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,840
regarding the decision to abolish Chinese characters,

1027
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,760
I don't agree with it at all.

1028
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,560
So, I refrain from saying my opinions.

1029
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,120
A punishable heart!

1030
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,120
Talking rubbish!

1031
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
We must strike back.

1032
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,080
We must absolutely not allow them to recklessly act like this.

1033
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,400
Let me see. I'll take the lead.

1034
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,840
Give Hu Shi, that child, a show of strength.

1035
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,080
Everyone says that Mr. Hu Shi has charm with women.

1036
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,440
Look, so many people came.

1037
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,680
Seeing it today, sure enough a justified reputation.

1038
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,440
Did you guys know?

1039
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,360
His young wife is a footbound peasant woman

1040
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,880
who can't understand classical Chinese.

1041
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,560
That can't be?

1042
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,600
I only just heard it before.

1043
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,760
Isn't his young wife a girl from a wealthy family who could read?

1044
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,360
I also heard this. Isn't it?

1045
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,840
He's here!

1046
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,800
Mr. Shizhi is here!

1047
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
Ladies.

1048
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,720
Gentlemen.

1049
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,560
Happy spring.

1050
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,840
Happy spring!

1051
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,600
Today's topic I'm speaking about is

1052
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
"Vernacular Chinese and Vernacular Poetry".

1053
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,040
Lots of friends ask me

1054
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,680
why do you, Hu Shi, insist on advocating for vernacular Chinese

1055
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,600
and abandon the tradition of classical Chinese.

1056
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,600
My answer is:

1057
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,680
first, classical Chinese of those days

1058
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,240
is a kind of half-dead kind of writing.

1059
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Ordinary people are unable to understand what they see, even less what they hear.

1060
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,320
Second, the vernacular Chinese we are advocating today

1061
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,080
is a kind of living writing,

1062
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,450
not at all vulgar.

1063
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,000
Third, vernacular is not only not vulgar

1064
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
it is also very elegant and practical.

1065
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,080
Because vernacular

1066
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,800
is a kind of very expressful language.

1067
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,000
We know

1068
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,720
expressing meaning is a language's main function.

1069
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,920
Language that doesn't express is not beautiful.

1070
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,440
For example,

1071
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,440
in Mr. Lu Xun's novel "A Madman's Diary"

1072
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,200
there is such a passage like this,

1073
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,520
Old man Zhao turned around and fell down on the street,

1074
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,520
flopped and kowtowed three times.

1075
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,760
This section is simple, lively, graceful and vivid.

1076
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,600
It would be hard to attain this in Classical Chinese.

1077
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,040
I don't know

1078
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,840
if everyone here agrees with me.

1079
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,960
Agree!

1080
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,280
Agree! Good!

1081
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,080
Good!

1082
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,920
Forgive me for begging to differ with

1083
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,680
Professor Hu's point of view.
