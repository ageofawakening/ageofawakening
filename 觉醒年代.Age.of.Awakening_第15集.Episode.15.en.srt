00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,480
As for this socialist country you just mentioned,

[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,120
does it mean that people no longer exploit other people

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,520
and no one bullies us poor people?

7
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:14,757
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,800
Exactly, that's what it means.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,640
Then do we have the bearded man you mentioned

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,160
and people like Lenin

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,440
in China?

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
If so, let's go find him!

13
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,160
Don't worry, everybody.

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
Now a group of people are on their way to look for him.

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
You are the bearded man!

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,600
You are the bearded one!

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,880
The dumpling wrapper you rolled out are too thick.

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
Take a seat, everybody!

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,640
Go ahead, the meal is ready!

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,200
Come on guys, it's time to eat!

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,200
Happy Lunar New Year, Sir!

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,880
Best wishes for the New Year!

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,160

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,120
One for each of you.

26

Be healthy and happy!

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,120

The Peking University Library in the Red Building

is organizing a holiday break reading club.

The sessions will begin after January 5th of the Lunar Calendar.

of the "New Youth" distribution station in Beijing,

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,040
you can gather the students

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
to study and work on the distribution at the same time.

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,720
How about that? What do you say?

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm in!

43
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,880
I was just worried about potential channels for distribution of "New Youth".

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
If that's the case, we're going to be colleagues again!

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,160
Colleagues indeed!

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,560
Shouchang, you're really good at this!

47
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
You gathered up all the bright young minds here.

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,680
That's not why we're here, brother Zhongfu.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,520
We're here to deliver New Year's greetings to you,

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
and at the same time,

51

these students wish to seek your advice on quite a few matters.

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,840
What type of matters?

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,240
Mr. Zhongfu,

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,760
nowadays the New Culture Movement is becoming

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
the center of public discussion in the whole society.

56
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,840
When we are talking about it with our classmates,

57
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,840
we often come across controversial issues.

58

[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Peking University Student]

59
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,760
So we especially wish that

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,520
you could give us a seminar in the reading club.

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
What kind of controversial issues?

62
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,400
For example, what's the relationship between

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
promoting New Culture and ideological enlightenment

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
and transforming national character?

65
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,280
Also, what are the manifestations of

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,720
the limitations of traditional culture?

67
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
What's the relationship between

68
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
promoting New Culture and

69
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
channeling Western theories and ideologies?

70
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
And also, what approaches should be taken

71
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,120
in promoting New Culture?

72
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,000
Exactly!

73
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
All of these are big questions

74
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
targeting complex issues!

75
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,080
I, Chen Duxiu, don't have the capacity to answer.

76
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
Nor can I prescribe this panacea.

77
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,000
But, anyway, Peking University will soon hold

78
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
a New Culture-centered lecture series, after the school starts.

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
Mr. Cai will lead

80
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
all the principle figures of New Culture Movement

81
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,280
to converge by then.

82
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,040
I hope all of you guys will actively participate.

83
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,160
Great! Terrific!

84
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,600
Alright guys,

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
let's head in first. It's too cold outside.

86
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
Come in please.

87
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,680
Come in.

88
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Please.

89
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,760
Shouchang,

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,400
after you, sir.

91
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,160
Sir,

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,600
sir,

93
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,880
where do you think we should hang this?

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,600
Right.

95
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
Why do you want this be hung?

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
This is for celebrating the founding of our reading club.

97
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,240
Students,

98
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
please all come over here for a second.

99
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,720
I'd like to ask you guys,

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,680
what do you think of our reading club?

101
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
The reading club offers us a platform to communicate our thoughts,

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,040
and to elevate our level of thinking.

103
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
The reading club also enables us to

104
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
take the discussion of social issues to a deeper level,

105
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
and then to apply our collective wisdom

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,320
to proposing better solutions.

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,360
Anything else?

108
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,840
I think both of you made great points here.

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
But I also believe

110
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
our reading club should not merely

111
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,200
scratch the surface of things at the theoretical level.

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Spreading the truth, enlightening our people

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
and thus transforming the whole society,

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
I believe this should be our highest mission.

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
And most importantly, this mission requires

116
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
devotion of heart and soul of generations of people.

117
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
It may even be an arduous endeavor that

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
require hundreds of years of such devotion.

119
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
In front of such a grand endeavor,

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
I don't think any type of formality matters.

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
Why is that?

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
Because it is only through

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,480
our relentless efforts

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
can we build our road to success.

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
Therefore, I think

126
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
our reading club

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,360
should be plain and honest.

128
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm not sure if you guys

129
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
would agree with what I just said.

130
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
Agreed.

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
I sincerely hope that all of you

132
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
will be engrossed in reading and thinking,

133
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
taking each and every solid step towards our common goal.

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
We not only have to routinize the activities of our reading club,

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
but also need to popularize it

136
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
and make it accessible to the general public.

137
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
Do you all have that confidence?

138
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,920
Yes, we do!

139
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Shall we put this aside?

140
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,440
Sure.

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Let's all get back to work.

142
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
Zhongxie, let's continue.

143
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
Let's shelf the books we just registered.

144
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,480
Okay.

145
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,920
Dear students,

146
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
the topic for our reading club discussion today is

147
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,040
monthly commentary on current affairs.

148
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,240
It will be held in two parts,

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
in the first part, Chen Yannian

150
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,480
will offer us an overview on the

151
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,920
domestic and international situations in the recent month;

152
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
in the second part, we will have a free discussion.

153
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,480
Now please welcome Chen Yannian.

154
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,920
Dear students,

155
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
the domestic and international situation in the last month

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
can be captured by four words:

157
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
crisis-ridden, intricate and confusing.

158
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
Let's begin with the domestic situation.

159
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,080
First,

160
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,880
Duan Qirui's Anhui Clique and Feng Guozhang's Zhili Clique
(mutually hostile factions that split from Beiyang Government during the Warlord Era)

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
were having a nasty fight.

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
After Duan Qirui gained an upper hand,

163
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,280
he decided to resume his old activity,

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,920
and is now gathering armed forces to suppress the Southern Government.

165
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,720
Second, the Southern Government is facing endless internal strifes.

166
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Sun Yat-sen is losing his power to others.

167
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
Third, Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique

168
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,560
seized the 100,000 riffles

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,120
ordered by Republic of China Army (ROCA) from Japan,

170
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
and is now drastically strengthened.

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,000
Internationally,

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,760
first, Russia led by Lenin

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,280
was forced to sign the

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,960
“Treaty of Brest-Litovsk” with Germany

175
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
to withdraw from the World War

176
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,160
so as to gain important breathing time for the nation.

177
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Second, the European theater is in utter chaos.

178
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,840
The German troops started to...

179
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,400
Yannian,

180
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm sorry to interrupt.

181
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,480
Mr. Cai is here to visit our club.

182
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,080
Greetings, sir.

183
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,440
Greetings, everybody.

184
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,990
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

185
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
Please sit down.

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,120
You're doing an impressive job!

187
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,240
You showed comprehensive understanding of

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
the domestic and international situations in the past month.

189
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,320
And your presentation is very clear.

190
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,600
Impressive!

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
Sir, you flatter me.

192
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,200
These are all based on information I retrieved from Peking University Library.

193
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
The sources are easily accessible.

194
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
All I did was to organize them a little bit.

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
The organization of information is actually an essential part.

196
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Effective organization takes painstaking investigation and through examination

197
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,880
to extract and deliver more accurate information for the audience.

198
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,200
You guys here are listening with

199
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
great concentration and interest.

200
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
How harmonious!

201
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Mr. Cai,

202
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,360
do you know why they're all laughing?

203
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
You have only seen the harmonious side of our club.

204
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,880
Yet, you haven't experienced

205
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,800
their "aggressive" arguments.

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,720
What do they argue about?

207
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,320
It's because everybody has different beliefs here.

208
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,520
Some believe in communism,

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
others in anarchism,

210
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,360
and others in pragmatism.

211
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,720
Everybody comes with good intentions,

212
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
but they soon get into arguments as the discussion deepens.

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
In fact, arguments are not necessarily bad.

214
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,800
If we view it from the long course of human history,

215
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
in the process of human development

216
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,200
we seek survival and prosperity.

217
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,840
The beliefs emerged

218
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,560
and the routes that were taken,

219
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,120
all of them were outcomes of arguments.

220
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,720
Right?

221
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,200
Our visit to your club today

222
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,920
is to extend out support to you.

223
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Feel free to me if you guys encounter any difficulties.

224
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,520
Please resume.

225
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,480
Thank you, Sir.

226
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Speaking of...

227
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
Secondly, the European theater is in utter chaos.

228
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,520
The German troops started

229
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,120
massive attacks at the Western Front,

230
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,600
hoping to defeat Britain and France

231
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,240
and reverse the situation

232
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,440
in the summer of 1918

233
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,720
before the United States arrives in Europe.

234
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,040
Third, on 8 January,

235
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,400
the U.S. President Wilson outlined the "Fourteen Points"

236
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
in the speech on war aims and peace terms to the U.S. Congress.

237
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,760
For the first time,

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,520
the idea of a League of Nations was proposed.

239
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
The designated goal of such a league is to

240
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,560
afford mutual guarantees of

241
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
political independence and territorial integrity

242
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
to great and small states alike.

243
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,120
For more than two months,

244
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Wilson's Principles for Peace has continued to influence.

245
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,960
[Zhou Shuren (Lu Xun), styled Yucai, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

246
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Yucai!

247
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
What's up, Yucai?

248
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,880
Yucai?

249
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,080
What's wrong?

250
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,320
What happened?

251
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,285
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Professor at Peking University]

252
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,080
Is it done?

253
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
Is it?!

254
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
This means, I'm holding

255
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,960
the manuscript of the very first

256
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
 modern vernacular novel in China.

257
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,520
And I will be its very first reader.

258
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,480
You know what...

259
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
if you had told me that you're having this successful completion today,

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
I would have brought a camera

261
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
to document this monumental moment in history!

262
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,240
"A Madman's Diary"

263
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
Two brothers,

264
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
whose names I shall keep secret here,

265
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,160
Yucai,

266
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
you haven't put your name down yet.

267
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Yucai,

268
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
who is the "father" to this "child"?

269
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
(Writing down "鲁迅" Lu Xun)

270
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,800
Zhou Shuren,

271
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
from now on will become Lu Xun.

272
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,920
Lu Xun.

273
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,120
Lu Xun.

274
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,400
In April 1918,

275
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,840
Lu Xun completed his vernacular diary-formed novel

276
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,800
"A Madman's Diary".

277
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
It was the first modern vernacular novel in China.

278
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
Like a heavy bomb, it was launched by the New Culture Movement

279
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,080
towards feudal ethics.

280
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,280
It drastically expanded the influence of Literary Revolution.

281
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,360
It bears long-lasting significance

282
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
in Chinese history of modern literature

283
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
as well as Chinese modern cultural history.

284
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,760
It's done!

285
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,040
It's done!

286
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,400
My brother is someone who eats people!

287
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I am the brother of someone who eats people!

288
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
I myself will be eaten by people,

289
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,720
yet I am still the brother of someone who eats people!

290
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,720
Brother Zhongfu,

291
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,520
Shouchang, hurry,

292
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,320
I have another paragraph to share!

293
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,800
Let me tell you guys,

294
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,240
I really enjoy this part,

295
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,600
listen to this,

296
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
Little sister was eaten by her older brother;

297
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,960
whether my mother knew or not,

298
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,720
I had no way of knowing.

299
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
It's not certain that, unwittingly,

300
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
I did not eat a few pieces of my little sister's flesh;

301
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,040
and now it is my turn,

302
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,840
Me, with a four thousand year history of eating people...

303
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
although at the time I didn't know,

304
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,840
I now understand;

305
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
it is hard to face real humans!

306
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,560
Each word stabs the heart!

307
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
Reading Yucai's novel

308
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
feels like an invisible fist

309
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,960
pounding abruptly on my chest.

310
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
Especially this last paragraph,

311
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
he wrote "children who have not yet eaten people may still exist..."

312
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,640
Right!

313
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,080
To whom is he directing this question to?

314
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,360
Immediately after that he wrote

315
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
"save the children..."

316
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,320
Exactly!

317
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,960
Indignant and profound!

318
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
Mr. Cai, those very sentences!

319
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Perceptive! Radical!

320
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,200
Radical!

321
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,080
Here, here,

322
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
let me tell you which part I like the best.

323
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,960
When I open up a history book,

324
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
the history is undated,

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,600
and scrawled across every page

326
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,920
are a few words about compassion, duty, propriety and integrity.

327
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
As I couldn't sleep anyway,

328
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,480
I read closely for half the night,

329
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,760
and only then from the seams of the letters could I see

330
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
the two words that it was packed full of:

331
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
"Eat people"!

332
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,280
A Madman's Diary!

333
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,400
Lu Xun, Yucai!

334
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,720
Yucai has real talent, I have said this a long time ago!

335
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,640
See how zealous he is.

336
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
I should not just be knocking on the desk here.

337
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,960
We should have Yucai come over,

338
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,480
I have to kiss him in person!

339
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,080
I'll tell you what,

340
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,680
what I'm feeling right now

341
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,080
is just like when I first read

342
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,680
"A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform" by Hu Shi.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
The fire in my heart is rekindled!

344
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,280
Yucai,

345
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,080
he has extremely keen sight.

346
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,840
This novel of his,

347
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,520
and its criticism of national characters

348
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
its exposing of feudal ethics

349
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
are utterly incisive!

350
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,880
Mr. Cai,

351
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,080
it's indeed a good piece of work.

352
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,440
But is it far too radical?

353
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
That's exactly what we need!

354
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,440
Indeed!

355
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,720
Towards this rotten society,

356
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,040
drastic measures are exactly what we need!

357
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,240
Shizhi,

358
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,640
are you worried that it's going to overshadow

359
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
your contributions in promoting vernacular literature?

360
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,440
I propose

361
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,520
we publish this in the upcoming issue of "New Youth"!

362
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,560
I agree!

363
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,200
Agreed!

364
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,080
Agreed!

365
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,960
Agreed!

366
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,840
Awesome!

367
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,480
Let's go!

368
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
The meeting is starting!

Forming student unions

430
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,280
is to correct everyone's morals

431
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,640
and improve everyone's knowledge.

Hence,

459

Its specialty

460
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,840
is its spirit.

461
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,720
There is only one element,

462
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,080
which is "New".

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,040
Hence,

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,240

and responsibility.

472
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,400

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
is to spark innovations in education,

Therefore,

478

The organization stipulates that

479
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,680
every member must accomplish the following:

480
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,800
first, to not be hypocritical;

481

fourth, to not gamble;

fifth, to not engage in prostitution.

isn't this a little strict?

487
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,040
It's too harsh.

488
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320

according to the Constitution,

502

and graduated.

503
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920

520
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,680

"A Madman's Diary",

579
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,720
has attracted attention from many people.

580
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,240
It can be said that

581
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,240
this is the cornerstone of the New Culture Movement.

582
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,440
Great, Brother Zhongfu!

583
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,560
What did I tell you?

584
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,480
To make "New Youth" popular, you have to come to Beijing.

585
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,760
Come down.

586
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,480
Come down and speak.

587
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,680
Let me just add.

588
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,720
Alright, please continue.

589
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,520
Let me tell you.

590
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,800
The location is definitely important,

591
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,360
but the most important element

592
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,640
is still people.

593
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,760
You are right.

594
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
Brother Zhongfu, please have a drink.

595
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
I agree with Brother Zhongfu's opinion.

596
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
The power of man is most important.

597
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,360
Since this edition is so popular,

598
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,000
I suggest

599
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,760
royalties for the authors.

600
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
Should we?

601
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,960
Professor Shen,

602
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,080
why do you bring up the topic of money?

603
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Dean Chen, that's not what I meant.

604
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
I don't care what you mean.

605
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,040
As the chief editor,

606
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
I want to remind everyone

607
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,720
the "New Youth" revolution

608
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
is just beginning.

609
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
We still need to work hard on it

610
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,400
and should not think about other matters first.

611
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,680
Brother Zhongfu,

612
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
brother Yinmo,

613
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,320
I personally believe

614
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,400
Brother Zhongfu's reminder is timely.

615
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,760
If we want to accomplish great things, we need to have high standards.

616
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,720
But Brother Yinmo has a point as well.

617
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
Profits have increased,

618
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
increasing royalties for the authors

619
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
is not unreasonable.

620
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,280
If we increase the royalties,

621
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
we will decrease the price of the magazines.

622
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
These are the values that our publication

623
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
wants the reader to know.

624
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,520
Alright, let us follow this principle.

625
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
Back to serious matters,

626
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
our editorial meeting today is very important.

627
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,840
We have two matters we need to discuss.

628
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
First, starting from this edition,

629
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
all essays must be written in vernacular Chinese.

630
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
This first publication

631
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,720
will serve as the benchmark of the New Culture Movement

632
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
to promote to the rest of society.

633
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
Second, from the next publication onwards

634
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,960
the "New Youth" magazine's

635
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
editorial committee

636
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
will be managed by a rotation of editors.

637
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,720
The editorial committee of every publication

638
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
will be managed by Chen Duxiu

639
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,640
and Shizhi, who is not present today,

640
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
is a member of the editorial committee.

641
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
Hence, our "New Youth" magazine

642
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,040
will enter a new phase.

643
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,680
Can I be an external member of the editorial committee?

644
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,160
I don't agree.

645
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,120
Why?

646
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,080
I just said,

647
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,160
everyone here is a formal member.

648
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
How do you become an external editor?

649
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
What does everyone think?

650
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,480
Editors should be internal members.

651
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,000
That's applause.

652
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,920
Let this pass then.

653
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
We will then invite

654
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
this so-called external editor to

655
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,280
share some insights with us.

656
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,600
For me, I recently

657
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
had this thought,

658
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,960
which can be considering an understanding,

659
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,920
has been stewing in my mind for quite some time.

660
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,000
I will tell it to the various professors

661
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,200
and gentlemen here

662
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,560
and let everyone discuss it.

663
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
Zhongfu has arrived in Peking University for

664
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,000
about a year.

665
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,880
It's been a year.

666
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,600
More than a year.

667
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
A year and a half.

668
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
You see, in this one year and a half,

669
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,520
Zhongfu has been in Peking University.

670
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
I have asked him to bring "New Youth" with him

671
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,000
to Peking University.

672
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,920
Such a short time has passed,

673
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
but "New Youth"

674
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,240
now represents the New Culture Movement

675
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,320
in Beijing, and even the whole of China.

676
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,680
It is the one and only magazine.

677
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,280
Mr. Cai,

678
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,720
I believe now,

679
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
we should all seize the opportunity

680
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,080
and garner support for the New Culture Movement in Peking University.

681
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Then make use of "New Youth"

682
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,040
as a benchmark

683
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
to motivate Peking University's students and teachers

684
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
to start-up a few more magazines.

685
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,360
The key is to publish different viewpoints.

686
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,440
Good, more viewpoints.

687
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,720
Well, he's always bothering me.

688
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,360
Having opposing and supportive viewpoints,

689
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,800
even insulting ones,

690
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,480
allows the New Culture Movement

691
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,680
to be strengthened by fighting and dissent.

692
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,480
Good.

693
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
Well said.

694
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,440
I say,

695
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,040
this Huang Kan,

696
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,000
and recently with Gu Hongming and Liu Shipei,

697
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
have always visited Lin Shu's residence.

698
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
What are they doing?

699
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
They are discussing on how to refute "New Youth".

700
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,760
Brother Deqian,

701
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,880
this isn't much.

702
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
This precisely proves

703
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,160
the power of the New Culture Movement.

704
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,800
It is able to stir up feelings in everyone.

705
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,160
This is good.

706
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,640
Alright, just leave it with me.

707
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,800
Let me tell everyone.

708
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
The day before yesterday,

709
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,880
I received a letter from Mr. Lin.

710
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,200
He mentioned in his letter his view on Peking University's

711
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,480
promotion of the New Culture Movement

712
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
and expressed his strong disagreement.

713
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,400
Mr. Lin's words were incisive.

714
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,080
I told him,

715
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,280
I said, Mr. Lin,

716
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,120
you can come to Peking University to take a look.

717
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,560
If it's necessary,

718
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,080
you can host a seminar in Peking University.

719
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,920
What I meant is

720
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,160
to allow those that

721
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
disagree and agree with the New Culture Movement

722
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,000
to voice their views in Peking University.

723
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
As proponents of the New Culture Movement,

724
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,480
we should be magnimous.

725
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
What does everyone think?

726
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
No problem.

727
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
We are not afraid of insults.

728
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
We are not afraid of fights.

729
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,160
No, not fights.

730
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
We are not afraid of challenges.

731
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
We will grow through facing adversity.

732
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,120
Exactly!

733
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,040
If this is the case,

734
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,240
I want to say,

735
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,400
should we choose a theme?

736
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,480
You see,

737
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,880
Lu Xun just published his "A Madman's Diary".

738
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,040
It has already attracted the attention of society

739
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
with Vernacular Chinese as the subject of discussion.

740
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,240
Mr. Cai, we might as well set

741
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
the theme of Vernacular Chinese

742
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
and organise a series of talks

743
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,560
to promote the usage of Vernacular Chinese.

744
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,240
Good.

745
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,600
I agree.

746
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
Yucai, what do you say?

747
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,400
What do you think?

748
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,160
I...

749
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,520
I will just talk about books written in Vernacular Chinese.

750
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,560
Good.

751
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,320
I will talk about the issue of China's written script.

752
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,280
This is a good topic!

753
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,000
Good!

754
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,960
What topic have you chosen?

755
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,600
I haven't decided.

756
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
Let me think aboout it.

757
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,840
Quickly think about it.

758
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,960
Write it down.

759
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,400
Alright, I will quickly think about it.

760
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,360
Zhongfu,

761
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,720
I will talk about my philosophical opinion.

762
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:15,840
Alright.

763
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,880
I believe we need to value the importance of philosophy in society,

764
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,920
emphasize the importance of philosophy in society.
