00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,092
[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:07,163
[Episode Twenty-five]

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,640
Today we are talking about ancient Chinese philosophy.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,560
It is a question discussed by the academic circles.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,200
What you said just now is a political issue.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
It's a political issue.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,240
As a student

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,640
It's a good thing to care about Shandong's problems

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,240
But can Shandong be returned to China?

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,040
This was discussed by politicians in Paris Peace Conference.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,040
And research decisions.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,360
Instead of today when we are in class.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,960
A problem that can be decided

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
Students can think that academics and politics

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,240
It is impossible to completely separate.

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,720
Under the so-called nest, there are finished eggs.

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
If a country cannot even protect its sovereignty

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,680
What else is academic?

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,280
That's it

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,680
Isn't this disturbing the classroom order?

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
Academic and political issues

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,640
It really shouldn't be confused

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,880
There are finished eggs under the nest.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,760
Students, please be quiet.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,520
classmates

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
Quiet please

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,400
Guo Xingang classmate

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,440
You are in class today.

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,520
Noisy talk about Shandong's problems

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
Do you find it useful?

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
The decision on Shandong lies with Wilson.

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,120
Not one of your students.

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
Students' task is to study.

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,440
Learn the best state

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,120
It's peace of mind

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,120
Instead of caring for Xiaoli.

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,040
sir

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,520
There are not many college students in China

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
If even we don't care about the Shandong issue

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,120
Wilson is a foreigner.

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,880
Why should we care about our Shandong?

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,480
Put the sovereignty of Shandong

43
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,160
Be tied to a foreigner's mouth

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,600
Students think it is unreliable.

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,200
Excuse me, sir.

46
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,040
I can't be calm.

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,880
As students, we should concentrate on our studies

48
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,560
I think Lao Guo is right. Yes.

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,680
Wilson is a foreigner.

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,120
Why care about our Shandong?

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,160
We should care about ourselves.

52
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,200
Time to have a meal

53
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,520
Okay, right away

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:01,680
Haoleshama

55
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, right away

56
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,160
Haoleshama

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,320
Okay, right away

58
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,400


59
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,480


60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Haoleshama

61
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,120
Go for dinner

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,400
eat rice

63
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,720
good

64
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,440
How is it steamed corn-bread again?

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,880
I have to show movies at night.

66
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,840
Where can you fight it?

67
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
I can make abalone and sea cucumber.

68
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Can you afford it?

69
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,520
these days

70
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
In addition to the dozen people in the group.

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,960
There are no guests at all.

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,160
Jiuwotou

73
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
Or did I get it on credit from outside?

74
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,880
Do you like to eat?

75
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
Comrade Yu Shewei

76
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
Why are we just eating steamed corn bread here?

77
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
Where are the other comrades?

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
Just as I was preparing for the evening meeting.

79
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,640
Tell everyone about it.

80
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,400
Ge Xiumei from our screening group.

81
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,600
Have retired from the club

82
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Leave a letter, which has returned to Tianjin today.

83
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,400
How can there be deserters in only one month?

84
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
How many comrades are there?

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,760
Won't quit the club, too?

86
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,440
Lao Guo is busy with the petition group.

87
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Prynne will not come back when she goes out as a tutor.

88
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Divide this.

89
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:49,840
good

90
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,960
I think our mutual aid society should be reorganized.

91
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,240
About this petition group.

92
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,920
It's more important than our support society.

93
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
You can eat out when you go out to work.

94
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
When the family comes, they can go out and enjoy it.

95
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
Is this still communism?

96
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
When you join the club, you don't agree.

97
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
We share weal and woe as a family.

98
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,160
How come there are privileges and differences now?

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
The most critical question now

100
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,360
Is to make money

101
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Since we started the club, we have been unable to make ends meet.

102
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Now I'm running out of money

103
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
I agree with Comrade Yannian.

104
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
Now we are faced with the biggest problem.

105
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,280
Is a matter of survival.

106
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,040
Three work-study groups

107
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
Have to come up with a better way.

108
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,240
Brother Guo said

109
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,240
Let them come to our place for a package.

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,800
And the salary of New Youth magazine.

111
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
Has also come down.

112
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,280
It's all confiscated.

113
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,480
This comrade Guo Xingang is sick and tired at ordinary times.

114
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
Participating in group activities is not active.

115
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
The mention of Qingdao is like having chicken blood.

116
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,880
What does he care about chicken blood and cow blood?

117
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
Income generation is the key.

118
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,120
If you don't earn money, you won't be able to eat it.

119
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm a chef.

120
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,080
It's time to wash and sleep.

121
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
I have discussed everything with Comrade Yi.

122
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
Go to their school tomorrow to find their Jaif.

123
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,760
Give him ten percent more commission.

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
See if he can help us get some business.

125
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
This is unfair competition

126
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
Survival of the fittest.

127
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
Don't care so much.

128
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
I'll go with you that day, too

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
If it weren't for Xie Wanying.

130
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,560
Mobilize girls from all schools.

131
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,520
Charity to us

132
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
Our screening group has already closed down.

133
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,960
I can't stand being a seven-foot man.

134
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,160
Yannian

135
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
I think we need to find a time.

136
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,600
To discuss the articles of association.

137
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,960
I think it is very necessary.

138
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,920
That's the deal.

139
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,400
go

140
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,120
Brother Mao

141
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,080
I haven't seen you for so long.

142
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
We all thought you were back in Hunan.

143
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Actually, it's been half a month

144
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
I did two things.

145
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,680
What about the first?

146
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,280
With the help of Mr. Zhang Zhao

147
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
Take our Hunan to France

148
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
The first batch of students were sent away.

149
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
What about this second thing

150
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,240
Just follow Mr. Li Dazhao

151
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,840
I went to Changxindian several times.

152
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
Every day comes out at night.

153
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
I really don't have time to see you

154
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
I said I haven't seen you for half a month.

155
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
Why do you feel a little tired?

156
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,200
Actually, ah

157
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
I'm here for one more thing.

158
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm leaving tomorrow.

159
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Back to Hunan

160
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,800
You're going back

161
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,440
yes

162
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,720
In the blink of an eye, more than half a year.

163
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,160
Things in Beijing have been settled.

164
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
But what about Xinmin Society?

165
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
There are still many things to deal with.

166
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,160
What about when you were in Beijing?

167
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
Thanks to your brothers for taking care of me.

168
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,960
So what about me?

169
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
Or deliberately?

170
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
Politely decline's

171
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,040
润之兄

172
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,240
That's so kind of you; You shouldn't have

173
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
It's rare to get to know you.

174
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,760
And from you.

175
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
I can see something that I can't see in Beijing.

176
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,040
How do you say this?

177
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,960
I don't know exactly.

178
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
I always think it's just you.

179
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,040
To see what is really

180
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,400
Go to the public

181
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Actually, ah

182
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,520
I should thank you both.

183
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,240
Look at that.

184
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,080
You work on your own to support yourself.

185
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,880
Ah, this

186
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
Is to actually go to the public.

187
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
But we can't do it anymore.

188
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,920
We are going to fail.

189
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,320
Qiao Nianlai

190
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,040
I think so

191
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
Failure is not terrible.

192
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,480
Let's start all over again.

193
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,360
Say no

194
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
We can find a new way.

195
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, Yannian

196
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,160
This mutual aid society has been running for almost two months.

197
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
I always feel that there is something missing.

198
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,760
It seems to have only one shell and no soul.

199
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,560
This road still won't work.

200
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
Want to cross the Yellow River

201
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Bingsaichuan

202
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,480
Jiang Deng tai hang

203
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,080
Xuemanshan

204
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,720
Hard is the way

205
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,040
Hard is the way

206
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,600
There are many turnings

207
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,200
Yasunari

208
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,240
Yannian

209
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,280
Qiaonian

210
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,640
I think

211
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,760
Although the road is long

212
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,960
But Beijing

213
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Have a king's spirit.

214
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,680
中富先生

215
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,800
寿昌先生

216
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,760
Their claim

217
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
It's just a deafening sound.

218
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,440


219
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,120
Clean up Kun's royal spirit.

220
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,400
And?

221
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
They belong to our new youth again.

222
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
Spiritual leaders and mentors

223
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,120
And our contemporary young people

224
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
Is to give this kind of royal and earthly gas to connect.

225
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,600
In reality

226
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
Seek up and down

227
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
Find one for the world.

228
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
A new way out

229
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,920
Jiangshan daiyou

230
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,880
Talent comes out.

231
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Their poems and articles will be popular for hundreds of years

232
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,400
润之兄

233
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,920
To save the country and the people.

234
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,760
I am willing to walk with you.

235
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,440
Work together

236
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,760
Come on

237
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
ride the wind and cleave the waves

238
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Sometimes.

239
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,680
Zhigua Yun Fan

240
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,360
Jicanghai

241
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,920
encourage each other

242
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,640
润之啊

243
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,240
You go back this time.

244
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,440
What are you going to do

245
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,400
I want to know our China well.

246
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Let's see what our country lacks.

247
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,840
I can give you the answer to your question right now.

248
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
Science and democracy

249
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
What China lacks most now

250
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,880
These are the two things.

251
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,400
Well said, sir.

252
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Say it accurately

253
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,560
but

254
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,320
I still want to know about it.

255
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,160
A majority like us

256
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,920
Are farmers and illiterate countries.

257
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,040
What exactly?

258
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,840
To make sense.

259
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
The Road to Blend Science with Democracy

260
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,080
That's a good question

261
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,040
Ask deeply

262
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
I recently wrote an article.

263
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,640
Articles in Youth and Countryside

264
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm also trying to explore this question.

265
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Young people dare to think and dare to be flat.

266
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
Worth advocating.

267
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,240
China wants to develop

268
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
We must introduce the most advanced

269
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
Do theoretical support

270
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,360


271
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:11,440


272
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:11,840
Yes, sir.

273
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,480
sir

274
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
I have a question

275
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,040
I've always wanted to ask you.

276
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:17,920
You said

277
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,520
Do you really think

278
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
The fundamental problem of China

279
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
Is it a problem of backward cultural traditions?

280
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,360
Feiye

281
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,040
It is not culture that lags behind China.

282
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Is the lack of theories to guide the sustainable development of society.

283
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,680
Scientific theories

284
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
Those two gentlemen

285
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,720
Why use so much energy?

286
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,000
To shake the old culture?

287
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,560
Because it suppresses and hinders.

288
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,160
The birth of science and democracy.

289
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,160
More importantly, some people

290
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,120
Think of it as

291
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
Guiding ideology of saving the country

292
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,560
You don't knock it down.

293
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,480
The new theory can't stand.

294
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,640
The so-called unbreakable, unbreakable.

295
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,680
That's the truth.

296
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,520
Then it seems

297
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,280
Gentlemen, I want everything.

298
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
Deny traditional culture

299
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,080
Of course not.

300
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,640
Extensive and profound Chinese traditional culture

301
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,440
No one can deny it.

302
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,440
Over time

303
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,320
The country is peaceful.

304
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,440
I'd love to.

305
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Spend one's old age in a pile of old papers

306
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,400
What a pleasant thing that is!

307
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
My wish is surprisingly consistent with yours.

308
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,760
所以润之

309
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,720
urgent matter

310
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
It's for our China.

311
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
Looking for new scientific theories

312
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,600
Are you really not going to work-study in France?

313
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
I still don't want to get out of pressure

314
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
If you really want to go abroad

315
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,360
I'd like to go to Russia.

316
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,040
You're going to Russia

317
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
Then you should ask Shouchang more.

318
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
He is a Russian fan now.

319
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,720
The doctrine of Lenin

320
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
It can be described as a few treasures.

321
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,200
But now!

322
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
I still want to have a good look.

323
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,080
Our own China

324
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,400
good

325
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,240
good

326
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
We will meet again

327
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,200
Wait for another time.

328
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
I want to listen to your views on China.

329
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,280
that

330
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,880
Gentlemen, please stay.

331
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,400
Students are leaving now.

332
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
It's a deal

333
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
You will preside over the meeting later.

334
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
Okay, I'll host it.

335
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,800
Comrades

336
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
Let's all put aside our work.

337
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,760
Let's have a meeting.

338
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,800
We're all here

339
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
Comrades, today's meeting is very important

340
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
There are thirteen original members of our work-study mutual aid society.

341
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,000
Two people have left the club.

342
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,200
Eleven people should attend.

343
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,280
Including Comrade Guo Xingang who verbally proposed to quit the club.

344
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,320
Also attended the meeting tonight.

345
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,480
There are three agendas for our meeting today.

346
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,480
First, each work-study group reports its work.

347
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
The second is to discuss amending the articles of association of mutual aid society.

348
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,080
The third is to study the future work.

349
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
Let's move on to the first agenda of the meeting.

350
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,840
Each group reports its work.

351
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
Shi Cuntong, let's talk about it first

352
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,840
I have nothing to say.

353
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
The laundry group's business has been revoked

354
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,120
What about the laundry group? It doesn't exist anymore.

355
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,280
As the team leader, I say to you

356
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,000
The report is over.

357
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,240
Since the opening of the frugal canteen

358
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,600
Has been in a state of loss and half loss.

359
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
Start-up funds are running out.

360
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
At this rate

361
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,000
For another week at most.

362
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,320
Finished

363
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
Our screening group was also disbanded today.

364
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480
The reason is that for two months

365
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,000
Only three films can be shown.

366
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
All the schools that can show it have finished showing it.

367
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,360
No audience

368
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
The reason why we can make it to this day

369
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,160
It's all about female classmates.

370
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
The network support introduced to us

371
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,120
I don't think it's a business.

372
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,160
But a kind of charity.

373
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,720
I couldn't stand it, so it was dismissed.

374
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,120
I'm done.

375
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,680
good

376
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
Three teams report over.

377
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
Let's start the second agenda.

378
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,240
Yannian

379
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,280
Three work-study groups closed down and two closed down.

380
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,520
There's another one that can barely last a week.

381
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,200
I don't think it is necessary.

382
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,480
Let's move on to the second agenda.

383
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,800
We should admit that we failed.

384
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,280
We should announce it fair and square.

385
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,040
The first experimental group of mutual aid society

386
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,560
dismiss

387
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
Comrade Guo Xingang

388
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,000
Mutual aid is not dissolved.

389
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
First of all, we have to solve the question

390
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,040
We can't be confused.

391
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,200
When the experiment of anarchism!

392
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,400
What's not clear?

393
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,160
Anarchism is not for us.

394
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
This is the conclusion.

395
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,440
I disagree with you.

396
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
Do I think anarchism won't work?

397
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
But we didn't understand it at all.

398
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
What is anarchism?

399
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,680
Principle of mutual aid theory

400
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,480
Good!

401
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
Then please, this unfilial gentleman.

402
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,760
Let me tell you about it.

403
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,120
What is the principle of mutual aid?

404
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:33,920
good

405
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
First of all, the first principle of mutual aid theory

406
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,320
Is communism.

407
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,760
Anyone in the mutual aid society

408
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,040
No private property shall be retained.

409
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,960
But look at our club.

410
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,280
When Yi Qun put his clothes first

411
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,640
When it's dedicated to everyone

412
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,640
What do you get?

413
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
Get sarcasm and ridicule.

414
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
When most people are penniless

415
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
Some people have small coffers.

416
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
When most people

417
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
When you have left your family relationship.

418
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,480
Some people can have dinner with their families.

419
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,960
Of course, I don't mean anything against anyone

420
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,480
I just wanted to say

421
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,160
It is this remnant of private ownership.

422
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,600
Corrupt our mutual aid society

423
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,760
It caused a disharmony between us.

424
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,640
Mutual suspicion

425
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
And the phenomenon of mental dispersion.

426
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,520
I disagree with you.

427
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,400
I don't think the reason why the mutual aid society can't go on

428
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,160
Because of this society.

429
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
There is no condition for the free development of individuals.

430
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,480
in other words

431
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,240
Personal labor is not enough to maintain

432
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
When it comes to individual interests

433
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
It's just a fantasy.

434
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,040
I don't agree to dissolve the mutual aid society.

435
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,960
I ran away from home and came here.

436
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
Is to pursue freedom.

437
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
It's a little bitter to be a mutual aid society

438
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,320
But it gave me freedom.

439
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,280
especially

440
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,400
Especially gave me the freedom to pursue love.

441
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,600
Sister Qun, who are you in love with?

442
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,200
Okay, I'll have this chance today

443
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,400
Boldly announce

444
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,400
I fell in love.

445
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Comrade He Mengxiong

446
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,880
Sorry, Comrade He Mengxiong.

447
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,640
Sorry, Comrade Yi

448
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,240
I already have someone I love.

449
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,080
What are you nervous about?

450
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,840
You can like others.

451
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
But it doesn't affect my feelings for you.

452
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,160
in that case

453
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,920
I don't want to hide my feelings anymore.

454
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,640
I declare that at least until now.

455
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,480
I think Comrade Yi Qunxian

456
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
Still very cute.

457
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,320
good

458
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,280
thank you

459
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,000
Comrades digress.

460
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,920
Let's get down to business now.

461
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,600
The problem we are facing now is

462
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
Work attendance can no longer be maintained.

463
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,240
The mutual aid society survived.

464
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
What are we going to do now?

465
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,840
There is no alternative but dissolution.

466
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,240
I don't agree to dissolve the mutual aid society.

467
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,360
The mutual aid society was dissolved.

468
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
I'm not going back to my original life.

469
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,080
I disagree

470
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,200
Do you disagree?

471
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,400
Then come up with something

472
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,520
What can I do?

473
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,240
Unless my dad comes to sponsor us.

474
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,840
Do you agree?

475
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
What can you do about it?

476
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,640
Let's be parasites

477
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,040
Then I can't help it.

478
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,120
Yannian

479
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,760
You are a social committee and have a special status.

480
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,200
At the end of the day, we people

481
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,720
Are all influenced by "New Youth"

482
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
To find a new way out.

483
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,760
Tell us all about it.

484
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,320
good

485
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,320
Comrades

486
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,480
It's our work-study mutual aid society.

487
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,400
One of the initiators of the first experimental group

488
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,120
Now this experiment has failed.

489
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,640
I am responsible.

490
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,240
I'm sorry everyone.

491
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Yannian, don't do this.

492
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,000
It's not your responsibility.

493
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,800
First of all, I want to make a statement.

494
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm not a believer in Chen Duxiu.

495
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,280
It is true that I am mentally

496
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,960
Agree with the new culture movement he advocated.

497
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,840
I support his proposal of Mr. De and Mr. Sai.

498
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,360
But I really don't know.

499
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
What theory does he believe in?

500
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,080
And I have faith.

501
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,000
I respond to Wang Guangqi's call.

502
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,600
Make this work-study mutual aid society experiment.

503
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
Because it's for the work-study mutual aid society

504
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,640
I have great hopes.

505
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,560
I hope that the future society

506
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,720
Can also become a work-study society.

507
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
But today I have to admit

508
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,320
Our experiment failed.

509
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,480
What is the reason for the failure?

510
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,760
I haven't figured it out yet.

511
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
But what I know is

512
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm not going to let

513
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,560
The failure of a brief experiment

514
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,640
And give up my heart

515
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,760
The pursuit of ideals in society

516
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,040
i believe

517
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,160
Everyone here must be like me.

518
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,560
Even if what awaits us in front of us

519
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,080
Is countless failures.

520
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,680
And we will.

521
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
Go on unswervingly.

522
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,280
I propose

523
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,200
what course to follow

524
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,800
Let's show our hands.

525
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
Comrades, let's show our hands.

526
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,360
Those who agree to dissolve the work-study mutual aid society raise their hands.

527
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
Okay, the results are in.

528
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,280
I declare

529
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,560
The First Experimental Group of Beijing Gongdu Mutual Aid Society

530
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,320
dismiss

531
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,160
Let's clean up.

532
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,440
Time is like running water

533
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,680
I'll be home from school after class.

534
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,720
Let's think it over for a while.

535
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,480
Did you understand today's lesson?

536
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:17,280
Did the teacher ever violate what he said?

537
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,040
Looking forward to your parents' return.

538
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
Let's go all the way.

539
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,800
Governing the country in the future

540
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,560
Depends on our generation.

541
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,400
Everybody work hard!

542
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,720
See you tomorrow, classmates.

543
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
Time is like running water

544
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,360
I'll be home from school after class.

545
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,480
Let's think it over for a while.

546
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,520
Did you understand today's lesson?

547
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,880
Did the teacher ever violate what he said?

548
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,160
Looking forward to your parents' return.

549
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
Let's go all the way.

550
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,840
Governing the country in the future

551
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,520
Depends on our generation.

552
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
Everybody work hard!

553
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,200
See you again tomorrow, classmates.

554
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,600
Comrades

555
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
See you tomorrow.

556
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,400
Comrades

557
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,040
See you tomorrow.

558
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,760
This plaque has been hanging for two months.

559
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
I still took it off.

560
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
Lao Guo, put it here.

561
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,840
Mr. Cai

562
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,680
Gentlemen are here.

563
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,680
Come on, steamed buns.

564
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,640
There are no Anhui dishes today.

565
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,440
There is no Shandong cuisine.

566
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,720
Only steamed stuffed bun

567
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
Jiu steamed bun

568
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,960
What about today?

569
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,080
Let's have a chat with this steamed stuffed bun

570
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,120
is it all right

571
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,680
Okay, sit down.

572
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,040
Yu, you start first.

573
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,000
Everybody sit down.

574
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,280
Sit down.

575
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,320
Dear Mr Cai

576
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,240
Dear mentors,

577
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,600
Ladies!

578
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,600
Comrades

579
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,040
For me today

580
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
For the members of the Gongdu Mutual Aid Society

581
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,560
It was supposed to be a sad day

582
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,880
But because of Mr. Cai

583
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
And the arrival of the tutors.

584
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,880
It became a memorable day again.

585
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
More than two months ago

586
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
With the support and sponsorship of our tutors

587
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,560
Started this work-study mutual aid society.

588
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,480
Members of our mutual aid society

589
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,600
They are all uniform.

590
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
Twenty or so young men and women.

591
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
This is our first step towards life.

592
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,520
It is also our pursuit of ideal life.

593
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,640
Experience and pursuit

594
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,960
We persisted for more than two months.

595
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,800
We failed today.

596
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
Support and regret for our tutors.

597
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,680
have nothing to give in return

598
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,560
Let's ask Mr Cai to give us a lecture.

599
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,800
Please sit down.

600
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm sorry.

601
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
There's been a lot going on at school these months.

602
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,280
I didn't care.

603
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,120
Work-study mutual aid society

604
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,520
I hear it's going to be disbanded.

605
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,320
I'm still very surprised.

606
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,880
I ran to see everyone.

607
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm concerned about the theory of mutual aid.

608
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,960
And you use your own practical actions

609
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
Practicing the theory of mutual aid

610
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,560
So you are better than me.

611
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
In front of you

612
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
Although I am the head of a school

613
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,600
In this respect

614
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
I want to learn from you.

615
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,760
My brave behavior towards you young people

616
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,960
Show respect

617
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,000
i believe

618
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,040
Your practice and experiment of mutual aid theory today

619
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,400
Will become a valuable asset in your life.

620
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
I thank my husband for his recognition and encouragement.

621
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,840
In the past two months

622
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,920
We did everything we could.

623
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,720
What we can do

624
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,240
Although the experiment failed

625
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,920
But we have a clear conscience.

626
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,920
Take this opportunity today.

627
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,840
I would like to ask some gentlemen.

628
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,120
In your opinion

629
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,880
The root of the failure of this mutual aid society

630
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,840
What on earth is it?

631
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,400
You're good.

632
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,640
Failure without anger.

633
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,080
Keep a clear head and actively look for reasons.

634
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,560
In order to have the courage to move forward in the future

635
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,520
is it

636
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,400
be

637
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
Good yannian classmate, let me ask you first.

638
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,600
What do you think is the root of this failure?

639
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,240
I think there must be more than one reason

640
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,440
But the most important thing is

641
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,480
Maybe we're interested

642
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
The theory and method of mutual aid theory are not fully understood.

643
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,720
miss the point

644
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,920
Or there is a deviation.

645
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,920
What do you think?

646
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
I think there are many disputes.

647
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
Brother Zhongfu, I suggest opening another column

648
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,320
Let everyone be good

649
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,560
Summarize the experience and lessons

650
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,760
What do you think

651
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,960
Cai Gong is right.

652
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,200
Then I'll represent New Youth.

653
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,680
Officially asked the members for a draft.

654
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,000
You are Chinese youth.

655
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,800
Did a very useful experiment.

656
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,040
Your summary and experience

657
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,560
Is the most convincing.

658
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,160
At the same time?

659
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,960
I also want to ask Shouchang Shizhi to write the manuscript.

660
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,920
史鸷

661
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
You talk to everyone about your feelings.

662
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,720
I have studied work-study

663
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
In America

664
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,800
Tens of thousands of people live a work-study life.

665
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,360
But for young people in America

666
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,720
They are interested in the work-study program.

667
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,080
They think it is perfectly normal.

668
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
Extremely free choice

669
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,680
It's not a great new life

670
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,360
But in China

671
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,200
It is an amazing thing.

672
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,560
As for us

673
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,560
Why did it fail after a few months?

674
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,240
There are many reasons.

675
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,280
I saw at least one of them.

676
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,440
Not well planned.

677
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
Work more and read less.

678
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,280
And the result?

679
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,840
It's just that working is much more bitter.

680
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,640
The fun of reading is a little less.

681
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:23,600
study through work

682
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,000
study through work

683
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,160


684
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,640
study through work

685
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
study through work

686
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
What is the relationship between the two?

687
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,680
Have you thought about it?

688
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,280
The purpose of working is to study.

689
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,880
And think about it.

690
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,000
Have we read many books in the past two months?

691
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
Do you have time to read?

692
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,680
Are there some classmates?

693
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,120
In these more than two months

694
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,960
Read fewer books than before.

695
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,920
I have

696
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,880
So let's support society.

697
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,800
Turn Ben Wei upside down

698
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,280
For the sake of success?

699
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,400
It's not Shizhi

700
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,720
You are a full man, but you don't know if a hungry man is hungry.

701
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,120
See no

702
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,720
This flat has just been taken off.

703
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
Lu Xun writes very well.

704
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,920
Ningshang forehead sweat

705
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,080
Blood in one's hands

706
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
Why do students do this experiment?

707
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
In order to rely on their own labor.

708
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,960
To maintain their studies.

709
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,760
right

710
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,680
So what's wrong with the students?

711
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,040
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

712
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,960
Shizhi, what you just said

713
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,840
No, work. How can I finish my studies?

714
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,080
And with what to eat?

715
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,160
Aren't you throwing cold water on everyone?

716
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,000
Why am I pouring cold water on it?

717
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,000
Shouchang, since you say so

718
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

719
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,840
My opinion is this.

720
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,800
To find the root of the failure of our mutual aid society.

721
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
First of all, we must recognize it clearly.

722
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,480
Is it caused by internal factors?

723
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,080
Or caused by external factors?

724
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,000
Have you considered Yannian?

725
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,440
The deeper reason

726
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,960
You mean

727
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,760
I mean, have you ever thought about

728
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,560
There is something wrong with the theory of mutual aid itself.

729
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,480
You mean there is something wrong with the theory of mutual aid itself?

730
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,520
Unscientific

731
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,640
I think at least everyone

732
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,680
We can study this problem.

733
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,280
There are two points.

734
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,480
in the first place

735
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,480
Is the theory of mutual aid?

736
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,840
A scientific theory.

737
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,600
Second point

738
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,760
Is it suitable for China?

739
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,360
So what's your conclusion?

740
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,800
I think the success of the October Revolution in Russia

741
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
More suitable for China than the theory of mutual aid.

742
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
Shouchang, you digress

743
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
I think you are taking this opportunity.

744
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,560
Promote the October Revolution

745
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,320
On this occasion

746
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
It's not appropriate to talk about these things.

747
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,920
I disagree with you.

748
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
It's not Shizhi

749
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,800
I didn't take the opportunity to promote the October Revolution.

750
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm just offering a new idea.

751
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,840
For everyone to discuss.

752
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
You can't mention the October Revolution

753
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,880
You're against it, right?

754
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,600
There is no conflict.

755
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,880
No, then how is it not contradictory?

756
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,680
On such an occasion today

757
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,400
Shizhi, I think it just contradicts.

758
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,360
All right, all right, all right

759
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,480
I have my opinion.

760
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,000
Students have their own opinions.

761
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
Shouchang's brother Professor Shizhi

762
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,080
What you two said makes sense to me.

763
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,480
Just don't discuss it here today.

764
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,400
Let's find a place another day.

765
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,080
Have a good discussion.

766
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,640
good

767
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,320
come

768
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,160
Failure teaches success.

769
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,720
The end is the beginning.

770
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,960
Our task today

771
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,560
Is to finish these buns.

772
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,480
Not just steamed stuffed bun.

773
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,960
Eat up all the pickles and vegetables here.

774
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,600
There is not a grain left in the clean canteen.

775
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,720
come on

776
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,120


777
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
Brother Shouchang, I really didn't resist

778
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,080
Erchi steamed bun ba

779
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,280
Eating, Mr. Cai

780
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,240
Do you really agree?

781
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,000
Let them both go back to Shanghai.

782
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,360
Didn't you also read Liu Wenyao's letter?

783
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
It's said that it's a work-study place in France.

784
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
To the French class of Aurora School.

785
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,160
The number of places in Beijing French Learning Museum has been allocated.

786
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,160
Yannian if they want to go to France

787
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,240
I have to go back to Shanghai to finish my studies.

788
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,760
Obviously, he designed this in the morning.

789
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,600
These two boys are preoccupied.

790
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,960
Want to go to France to work and study

791
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,360
Then let them go back to Shanghai.

792
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,960
The mutual aid society failed.

793
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,880
It hit them both particularly hard.

794
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
Especially prolong life.

795
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,600
The child has a heavy heart.

796
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,600
I'm afraid he can't bear it.

797
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,320
These two children are now taking risks and struggling.

798
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
An indomitable time.

799
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,760
In particular, it needs hardship to be tempered.

800
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,520
Don't worry

801
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,800
There is an old man like me.

802
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,480
These two men will be ruined.

803
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,360
Yannian qiaonian

804
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
Come out and talk to you.

805
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,800
dad

806
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,560
You have to lecture again.

807
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,800
No, I'm just talking to you.

808
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
You are going to Shanghai.

809
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,600
Go get a stool and sit down.

810
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,960
I lifted up my head and said I was tired.

811
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,320
Yannian

812
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,320
The mutual aid experiment failed.

813
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
I want to ask you, are you still so convinced?

814
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,680
The theory of anarchism?

815
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,960
Will you be angry if I say I firmly believe?

816
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,960
can't

817
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
truth

818
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,720
truth

819
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,920
Why?

820
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
Because I saw your reflection.

821
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,680
If you have reflection, you will not be blind.

822
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,280
i believe

823
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,960
You will surely find a right way.

824
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,560
I am willing to give you time.

825
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,040
I'm willing to go looking for it with you.

826
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,880
thank you

827
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,200
Dad, I thought you were going to force us again.

828
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,640
Studying the October Revolution?

829
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm not forcing you to pay.

830
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,240
Just a suggestion.

831
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,680
Rest assured.

832
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,680
Although we stick to the theory of mutual aid

833
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,960
But we will.

834
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,800
Learn in many ways.

835
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,800
good

836
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,800
During my stay in Beijing

837
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
I have seen your growth with my own eyes.

838
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,320
to tell the truth

839
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,240
As a father, I am very pleased.

840
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,440
We also have a new understanding of you.

841
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,840
Your thoughts have also benefited me and Qiao Nian a lot.

842
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,360
But there's just one thing

843
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,920
what

844
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,520
It's nothing

845
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,840
We want you to put your kind

846
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,160
Everyone's long style and habits should be changed.

847
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Especially when you treat your own people.

848
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,640
That would hurt them too much.

849
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,400
I'll fry some peanuts for you.

850
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,520
Take it back to eat on the road.

851
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,520
What are you doing?

852
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,080
The two children are going to Shanghai.

853
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,320
Can't I fry peanuts for them?

854
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,680
Go and get some pumpkin seeds.

855
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,640
Why

856
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,560
When Qiao Nian was a child, he liked fried peanuts.

857
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,760
Yannian likes to eat pumpkin seeds.

858
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,480
Pumpkin seeds and peanuts are heated differently.

859
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
You'll fry the lake if you mix it up.

860
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,560
Yannian

861
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,680
I like to eat pumpkin seeds fried in the lake.

862
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,280
You don't know this?

863
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,320
Think of this one?

864
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,240
It's a bit repetitive with what we published in the last issue.

865
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,200
So I suggest

866
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,920
this

867
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,280
Shouchang Zhongfu

868
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,680
史鸷

869
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,960
Tell you a good news.

870
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,200
My teacher, Mr Dewey, has decided

871
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,920
On the 27th, he left Japan to give lectures in China.

872
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,680
I'm here to ask for leave.

873
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,760
I want to meet my teacher in Shanghai.

874
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,840
See you happy.

875
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,200
The 27th is still a long way off.

876
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
Besides, at that time

877
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,120
My liberal arts senior should also step down.

878
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
You don't have to ask me for leave.

879
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
What are you talking about

880
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,240
When are you my senior?

881
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,320
Dewey's coming to China is a good thing.

882
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,960
Although I don't fully agree with him.

883
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,160
Experimental viewpoint

884
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,280
But his pragmatic idea

885
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,720
It's still refreshing

886
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,440
史鸷

887
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,200
With you, Jiang Menglin and Tao Xingzhi

888
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,720
Are his disciples.

889
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,080
You have a good plan.

890
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Let him stay in China for a few more days

891
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,360
Speak more times.

892
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,720
Now, Chinese people

893
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,520
Have a good feeling for America and Wilson.

894
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
I told you.

895
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,880
In order to arrange Mr Dewey's itinerary

896
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,960
We have been planning for more than a month.

897
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,760
I want to come to China this time through my teacher.

898
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,840
Can set off a wave in China

899
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,040
The whirlwind of experimentalism

900
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
Because experimentalism is so useful to China.

901
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,960
China wants to be strong.

902
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,960
We must learn from the United States in its entirety.

903
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,560
It's biased.

904
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,160
How long has the United States been founded?

905
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,000
How many years is China's history?

906
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,680
The national conditions of the two countries are different

907
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,800
Cultural traditions are different.

908
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,160
How can it be compared?

909
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
I agree with Shouchang.

910
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,480
But today?

911
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,160
I'd rather hope that the US pressure.

912
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,840
Can help us contain Japan

913
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,840
So I wrote an article last month.

914
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,240
Praise this Wilson as a great man.

915
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
You still think so?

916
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,200
Now I call him Wei Cannon

917
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
What does Wei Cannon mean?

918
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,160
He fired a gun.

919
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,920
His fourteen peace proposals

920
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,120
It's not like you didn't see it.

921
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,320
Which one is not an empty gun?

922
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,440
Let me see.

923
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,760
Put the Shandong issue in China on him.

924
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,200
hang

925
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,280
I think you two are too pessimistic.

926
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,280
I hope the facts don't make us pessimistic.

927
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,360
Mr. Cai

928
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,000
It's all here.

929
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,120
sir

930
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,840
Mr. Cai

931
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,120
Come on, sit down.

932
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,240
Please sit down.

933
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,120
I have something to tell you three.

934
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,520
Wang Daxie told me today.

935
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,840
He said that the Paris Peace Conference was not going well.

936
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,240
What about Japan? It was at the Paris Peace Conference.

937
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,840
Put out two files.

938
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
One is Duan Qirui.

939
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
In order to borrow money from the Japanese

940
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,120
He admitted that Japan could be in Shandong.

941
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,280
Inheriting all the rights and interests of Germany

942
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
Such a secret agreement

943
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
What about the second one?

944
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,840
It's Britain, France and other countries

945
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,400
Also acquiesced in such a treaty.

946
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,080
So now the Japanese shemale is holding these two documents.

947
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,840
Forcing Americans into submission

948
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,240
auv nana

949
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,720
Wilson doesn't want this axiom either.

950
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,280
Wang Daxie told me

951
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,760
The United States has always shared interests.

952
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,120
He must resist this request from Japan.

953
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,280
But to what extent can it be resisted?

954
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,720
It's hard to say.

955
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
Then Britain, France and Italy are unreliable.

956
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,560
The key is to look at this requirement of the United States for Japan.

957
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
What kind of plan will it come up with?

958
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,080
be over; be doomed

959
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,240
be unreliable

960
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
Who is unreliable?

961
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,800
I think Wilson is a gentleman.

962
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,160
Talk is reliable.

963
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,520
Let's just leave it at that.

964
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,000
Now we have to take care of ourselves.

965
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,680
It's really going to be such a big event.

966
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,040
How about our Peking University?

967
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,280
Now Peking University is famous.

968
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,680
Zhongfu or Shouchang

969
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,680
It's all on the police department's list

970
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,080
More importantly, our students don't attend classes.

971
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
This person's heart can't hold back.

972
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,800
It's the real Paris Peace Conference that's going to go wrong.

973
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,440
That's bound to happen in China.

974
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,120
So I said

975
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,520
Brother Zhongfu, we have to plan ahead.

976
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Mr. Cai

977
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,720
I think the current situation

978
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,920
Is a good situation.

979
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,360
Everyone's patriotic enthusiasm

980
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,640
It's all mobilized.

981
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,240
We just take advantage of the situation.

982
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,480
Mr. Cai, I don't think we can mess around.

983
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,560
This is the principle of guiding the situation according to the situation.

984
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,960
Zhongfu, why don't you talk?

985
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,280
I have to think about it.

986
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
You really have to think about it this time.

987
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,120
You can't go to extremes anymore.

988
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,880
No, Shizhi, how come you've been spending so much time lately?

989
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,720
Always talk about extremes.

990
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,760
You don't pour cold water on everyone

991
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,040
Are you uncomfortable?

992
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,160
I didn't mean that.

993
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,080
I'm just saying what I think

994
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,680
No offense, brother Zhongfu

995
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm hungry and go back to eat.

996
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,840
Is he angry?

997
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,640
Isn't that what it is?

998
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,960
Has feudalism grown?

999
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,000
This Mr. Cai

1000
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm hungry, too.

1001
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,480
I I I

1002
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm hungry. Me too

1003
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,240
I also went to eat.

1004
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,040
Yes, yes.

1005
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,760
寿昌

1006
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
All hungry, all hungry, all hungry.

1007
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,240
Mr Cai, can't I tell the truth?

1008
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,080
I just gestured to you, and you

1009
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,600
alright

1010
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,480
come on

1011
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,560
I'll take you to the scholar's residence for dinner.

1012
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:32,960
Come on, my treat.

1013
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,680
Come and treat me.

1014
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,880
You don't know.

1015
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,240
All countries are good.
