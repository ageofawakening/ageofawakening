[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:07,163
[Episode Twenty-five]

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,640
Today we are talking about ancient Chinese philosophy.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,560
It is a question discussed by the academic circles.

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,368
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,200
What you said just now is a political issue,

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
a matter of political discussion.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,240
As a student,

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,640
it's good to take an interest in Shandong's problems.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,240
But can Shandong be returned to China?

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,040
This was the issue discussed, studied, and decided

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,040
by the statesmen of the Paris Peace Conference,

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,360
and not an issue that we can decide

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,960
in the classroom today.

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
But students believe that it is impossible

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,240
to completely separate academics and politics.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,720
As the saying goes, there is no egg under the overturned nest.

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
If a country can't even protect its sovereignty,

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,680
what's the point of learning?

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,280
Exactly.

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,680
Isn't this disturbing the classroom order?

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
Academic and political issues

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,640
really shouldn't be confused.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,880
There is no egg under the overturned nest.

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,760
Students, please be quiet.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,520
Students!

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
Quiet please.

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,400
Student Guo Xingang.

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,440
You are in class today,

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,520
talking endlessly about Shandong's problems.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
Do you find that useful?

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
The decision on Shandong lies with Wilson.

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,120
Not with one of the students.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
The students' task is to learn.

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,440
To learn that the best state of mind

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,120
is a peaceful mind,

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,120
instead of having a deer in your heart.

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,040
Sir,

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,520
there are not many university students in China.

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
Even if we don't care about the Shandong issue,

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,120
Wilson is a foreigner,

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,880
why should he care about our Shandong?

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,480
To tie the sovereignty of Shandong

44
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,160
to a foreigner's mouth,

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,600
students cannot accept that.

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,200
Excuse me, sir.

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,040
I can't stay calm.

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,880
As students, we should concentrate on our studies.

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,560
I think Guo is right. Yes.

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,680
Wilson is a foreigner,

51
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,120
why should he care about our Shandong?

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,160
We should care about ourselves.

53
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,200
Time to eat!

54
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,640
Okay, right away.

55
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,400
Time to eat!

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,400
Time to eat.

57
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,720
Okay.

58
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,440
How is it steamed cornbread again?

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,880
I have to show movies tonight.

60
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,840
I can't run on this.

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
I can make abalone and sea cucumber.

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Can you afford that?

63
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,520
These days,

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
in addition to the dozen people in the group,

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,960
there are no guests at all.

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,160
Did I make this steamed cornbread

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
or borrow it from outside?

68
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,880
Don't you like to eat?

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
Comrade Yu Shewei,

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
why are we just eating steamed cornbread here?

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
Where are the other comrades?

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
Just as I was preparing for the evening meeting

73
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,640
telling everyone about it.

74
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,400
Ge Xiumei from our screening group

75
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,600
has retired from the club,

76
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
leaving a letter, and has returned to Tianjin today.

77
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,400
How can there be so many quitters in only one month?

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
Then there are a few comrades

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,760
who will not also quit the club, right?

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,440
Guo is busy with the petition group.

81
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:46,836
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Bai Lan will not come back when she goes out as a tutor.

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Distribute these.

84
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:49,840
Okay.

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,960
I think our mutual aid society should be reorganized.

86
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,240
Regarding this petition group,

87
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,920
I think it's more important than our mutual aid society.

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
You can eat out when you go out to work.

89
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
When the family comes, they can go out and enjoy it.

90
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
Is this still communism?

91
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
When joining the society, didn't we agree

92
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
to share weal and woe as a family?

93
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,160
How come there are privileges and differences now?

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
The most critical question now

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,360
is to make money.

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Since we started the club, we have been unable to make ends meet.

97
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Now we're running out of money.

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
I agree with Comrade Yannian.

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
The biggest problem we face now

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,280
is the problem of survival.

101
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,040
Three work-study groups

102
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
have to come up with a better way.

103
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,240
Brother Guo said

104
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,240
to let them come to our place to package meals.

105
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,800
and "New Youth" magazine revenue

106
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
has also come down.

107
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,280
It's all confiscated.

108
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,480
This comrade Guo Xingang is sick and tired at ordinary times.

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
Not active in group activities.

110
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
The mention of Qingdao is like having chicken blood.

111
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,880
What does he care about chicken blood and cow blood?

112
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
Having an income is the key.

113
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,120
If you don't earn money, you won't be able to eat.

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm a chef.

115
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,080
It's time to wash and sleep.

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
I have discussed everything with Comrade Yi.

117
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
Go to their school tomorrow to find the clerk.

118
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,760
Give him ten percent more commission.

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
See if he can help us get some business.

120
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
This is unfair competition.

121
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
It's survival of the fittest.

122
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
Don't care so much.

123
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Then I'll go with you tomorrow.

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
If it were not for Xie Wanying

125
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,560
mobilizing girls from all schools

126
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,520
to give us charity,

127
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
our screening group would have closed down.

128
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,960
I can't stand being a seven-foot man.

129
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,160
Yannian,

130
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
I think we need to find a time

131
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,600
to discuss the articles of association.

132
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,960
Okay, I think it's very important.

133
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,920
That's let's do it.

134
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,400
Go on.

135
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,120
Brother Mao,

136
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,080
I haven't seen you for so long.

137
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
We all thought you were back in Hunan.

138
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Actually, it's been half a month,

139
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
and I've did two things.

140
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,680
What's the first?

141
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,280
With the help of Mr. Zhang Shizhao

142
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
that we sent the first batch of students

143
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
from our Hunan to France.

144
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
The second thing,

145
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,240
was following Mr. Li Dazhao

146
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,840
to Changxindian several times.

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
Every day, coming home at night.

148
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
I really don't have time to see you.

149
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
I said I haven't seen you for half a month.

150
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
Why do you look tired?

151
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,200
Actually,

152
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
I'm here for one more thing.

153
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm leaving tomorrow,

154
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,120
back to Hunan.

155
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,800
You're going back?

156
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,440
Yes.

157
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,720
In the blink of an eye, more than half a year.

158
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,160
Things in Beijing have been settled.

159
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
But what about the Xinmin Society?

160
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
There are still many things to deal with.

161
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,160
During my time in Beijing,

162
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
I am very grateful to your brothers for taking care of me.

163
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,960
So I still

164
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
want to specially

165
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
politely decline.

166
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,040
Brother Runzhi,

167
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,240
that's so kind of you.

168
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
It's rare to get to know you.

169
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,760
And from your viewpoint,

170
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
I can see something that I can't see in Beijing.

171
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,040
How do you say this?

172
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,960
I don't know exactly.

173
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
I always feel that only you

174
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:26,103
[Mao Zedong, styled Runzhi, Peking University Library Assistant]

175
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,040
can see what is really happening

176
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,400
to the people.

177
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Actually,

178
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,520
I should thank you both.

179
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,240
Look,

180
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,080
you guys are working to support yourselves.

181
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,880
This

182
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
is a practical approach to the public.

183
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
But we continue to do it anymore.

184
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,920
We are going to fail.

185
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,320
Qiaonian, come.

186
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,040
I think

187
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
failure is not so terrible.

188
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,480
Why not start all over again?

189
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,360
Maybe

190
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
we can find a new road again.

191
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
Isn't that right, Yannian?

192
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,160
This mutual aid society has been running for almost two months.

193
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
I always feel that there is something missing.

194
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,760
It seems to have only one shell and no soul.

195
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,560
This road still won't work.

196
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
I wish to cross the Yellow River,

197
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160
yet ice blocks the river.

198
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,480
I wish to climb Taihang,

199
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,080
yet snow covers the mountain.

200
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,720
Hard is the journey.

201
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,040
Hard is the journey.

202
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,600
Many roads divided,

203
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,200
which to take?

204
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,240
Yannian,

205
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,280
Qiaonian.

206
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,640
I think,

207
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,760
although the road is long,

208
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,960
but Beijing

209
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
has a kingly spirit.

210
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,680
Mr. Zhongfu,

211
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,800
Mr. Shouchang,

212
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,760
their claims

213
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,440
are a deafening,

214
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,120
kingly energy that cleanses the heaven and earth,

215
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,400
and

216
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
they are also the spiritual leaders and mentors

217
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
of our new youth.

218
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,120
And the new youth of our time

219
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
is to connect this kingly spirit with the earthly spirit.

220
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,600
In practice,

221
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
searching up and down

222
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
for a new way out

223
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
for the world.

224
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,920
Each age brings forth

225
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
a new genius on this noble land.

226
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Their poems and articles will be known for ages to come.

227
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,400
Brother Runzhi,

228
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,920
to save the country and the people,

229
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,760
I am willing to walk with you,

230
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,440
to work together,

231
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,760
to cheer together.

232
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
A long wind

233
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,800
will break the waves.

234

Setting sail

235
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,360
and crossing the sea.

236
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,920
Encourage each other!

237
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,640
Runzhi,

238
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,240
you're going back this time,

239
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,440
what are you going to do?

240
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,400
I want to know our China well

241
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
and see what our country lacks.

242
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,840
I can give you the answer to your question right now.

243
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
Science and democracy.

244
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
What China lacks most now

245
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,880
are these two things.

246
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,400
Well said, sir.

247
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Precisely said.

248
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,560
But,

249
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,320
I still want to know about it.

250
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,160
A country like ours,

251
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,920
where most of the people are farmers and illiterate.

252
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,040
What is it like?

253
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,840
Only then

254
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
can we walk the path where science and democracy converge.

255
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,080
That's a good question.

256
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,040
Asked well.

257
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
I recently wrote an article.

258
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,640
on "Youth and the Countryside".

259
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm also trying to explore this question.

260
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Young people dare to think and do.

261
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
Worth advocating.

262
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,240
China's development

263
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
must be supported by the introduction

264
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
of the most advanced theories.

265
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,840
Yes, sir.

266
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,480
Sir,

267
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
I have a question

268
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,040
I've always wanted to ask you.

269
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:17,920
Go on.

270
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,520
Do you really think

271
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
the fundamental problem of China

272
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
is a problem of backward cultural traditions?

273
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,360
No.

274
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,040
It is not culture that lags China behind.

275
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,400
It's the lack of theories to guide the sustainable development of society.

276
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,433
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

277
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,680
Scientific theories.

278
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
Then why did you two gentlemen

279
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,720
use so much energy

280
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,000
shaking down old culture?

281
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,560
Because it suppresses and hinders

282
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,160
the birth of science and democracy.

283
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,160
More importantly, some people

284
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,120
think of it as

285
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
as a guiding ideology to save the country.

286
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,560
Unless you knock it down,

287
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,480
new theories cannot stand.

288
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,640
As the saying goes, if you don't break it, you can't build it.

289
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,680
That's the truth.

290
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,520
Then it seems

291
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,280
You two gentlemen are not trying to reject

292
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
traditional culture in its entirety.

293
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,080
Of course not.

294
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,640
No one can deny the profundity

295
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,440
of Chinese traditional culture.

296
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,440
In time,

297
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,320
the country will be peaceful.

298
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,440
I'd love to

299
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
spend my old age in a pile of old papers.

300
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,400
What a pleasant thing that is!

301
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
My wish is surprisingly consistent with yours.

302
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,203
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

303

So Runzhi,

304
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,720
it is imperative

305
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
to find a new scientific theory

306
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
for our China.

307
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,600
Are you really not going to work-study in France?

308
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
I still don't want to go abroad.

309
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
If I really want to go abroad,

310
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,360
then I'd like to go to Russia.

311
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,040
You want to go to Russia,

312
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
then you should ask Shouchang more.

313
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
He is a big fan of Russia now.

314
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,720
Leninism

315
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
can be described as a few treasures.

316
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,200
But now,

317
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
I still want to have a good look

318
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,080
of our own China.

319
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,400
Good.

320
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,240
Good.

321
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
We will meet again.

322
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,200
Next time,

323
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
I want to listen to your views on China.

324

gentlemen, please stay.

326
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,400
I shall leave now.

327
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
It's a deal.

328
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
You will preside over the meeting later.

329

let's all put aside our work.

332
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,760
Let's have a meeting.

333

are also attending the meeting tonight.

341
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,480
There are three agendas for our meeting today.

342
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,480
First, each work-study group reports its work.

343
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
Second, discuss amending the articles of association of mutual aid society.

344
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,080
Third, study the future work.

345
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
Let's move on to the first agenda of the meeting.

346
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,840
Every group must reports its work.

347
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
Shi Cuntong, let's talk about yours first.

348
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,840

Since the opening of the frugal canteen,

355
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,600
it has been in a state of loss and semi-loss.

Our screening group was also disbanded today.

361
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,240
Yannian.

376
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,280
Two out of three work-study groups closed down.

377
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,520
There's another one that can barely last a week.

378
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,200
I don't think it is necessary

379
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,480
that we move on to the second agenda.

380
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,800
We should admit that we failed.

381
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,280
We should announce it fair and square

382
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,040
that the first experimental group of the mutual aid society

383
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,560
will dissolve.

384
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
Comrade Guo Xingang,

385
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,000
mutual aid societies are not dissolved.

386
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
First you have to solve the problem, right?

387
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,040
We can't just become

388
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,200
an anarchist experiment in a muddle.

389
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,400
What's not clear?

390
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,160
Anarchism is not for us.

391
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
That's the conclusion.

392
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,440
I disagree with you.

393
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
Do I think anarchism won't work?

394
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
But we didn't understand it at all.

395
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
What is anarchism?

396
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,680
It's principle of mutual aid theory.

397
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,480
Well.

398
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
Then please, you unfilial gentleman,

399
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,760
let me ask you,

400
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,120
what is the principle of mutual aid?

401
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:33,920
Very well.

402
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
First of all, the first principle of mutual aid theory

403
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,320
is communism.

404
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,760
No one in the mutual aid society

405
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,040
may keep private property.

406
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,960
But look at our club.

407
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,280
When Yi Qunxian first contributed

408
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,640
her clothes to the group.

409
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,640
What did she get?

410
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
Sarcasm and ridicule.

411
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
When people are penniless,

412
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
some people have small coffers.

413
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
When most people

414
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
have disassociated themselves from family relationships,

415
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,480
some people have dinner with their families.

416
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,960
Of course, I don't mean anything against anyone.

417
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,480
I just wanted to say

418
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,160
is that this remnant of private ownership

419
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,600
is corrupting our mutual aid society

420
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,760
and causing a disharmony between us,

421
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,640
mutual suspicion,

422
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
and spiritual disconnection among us.

423
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,520
I disagree with you.

424
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,400
I don't think the reason why the mutual aid society can't go on.

425
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,160
It's because in this society,

426
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
there is no condition for the free development of individuals.

427
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,480
In other words,

428
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,240
personal labor is not enough to maintain oneself

429
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
when it comes to individual interests.

430
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
Mutual aid is just a fantasy.

431
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,040
I don't agree to dissolve the mutual aid society.

432
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,960
The reason why I ran away from home and came here

433
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
is to pursue freedom.

434
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
It's a little bitter to be a mutual aid society member,

435
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,320
but it gave me freedom.

436
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,280
Especially,

437
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,400
especially the freedom to pursue love.

438
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,600
Sister Qun, who are you in love with?

439
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,200
Okay, I'll take this opportunity today

440
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,400
to have a bold announcement.

441
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,400
I have fallen in love with

442
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Comrade He Mengxiong.

443
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,880
Sorry, Comrade He Mengxiong.

444
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,395
[He Mengxiong, Visiting student at Peking University]

445
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,640
Sorry, Comrade Yi.

446
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,240
I already have someone I love.

447
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,080
What are you nervous about?

448
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,840
You can like others.

449
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
But it doesn't affect my feelings for you.

450
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,160
In that case,

451
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,920
I don't want to hide my feelings anymore.

452
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,640
I declare that at least until now,

453
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,480
I think Comrade Yi Qunxian

454
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
is still really cute.

455
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Good!

456
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,280
Thank you.

457
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,000
Comrades, we're off topic.

458
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,920
Let's get down to business now.

459
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,600
The problem we are facing is

460
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
that hard work is no longer enough

461
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,240
to keep the mutual aid society afloat.

462
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
What are we going to do now?

463
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,840
There is no alternative but dissolution.

464
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,240
I don't agree to dissolve the mutual aid society.

465
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,360
If the mutual aid society is disbanded,

466
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
won't I have to go back to my old life?

467
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,080
I disagree.

468
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,200
Do you disagree?

469
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,400
Then come up with something.

470
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,520
What can I do?

471
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,240
Unless my dad comes to sponsor us.

472
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,840
Do you agree?

473
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
What can you do about it?

474
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,640
Let's be parasites.

475
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,040
Then I can't help it.

476
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,120
Yannian.

477
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,760
You are the social committee and have a special status.

478
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,200
At the end of the day, we people

479
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,720
are all influenced by "New Youth"

480
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
to find a new way out.

481
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,760
Tell us all about it.

482
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,320
Very well.

483
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,320
Comrades.

484
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,480
I am one of the initiators

485
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,400
of the first experimental group of our work-study mutual aid society.

486
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,120
Now this experiment has failed.

487
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,640
I am responsible.

488
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,240
I'm sorry everyone.

489
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Yannian, don't do this.

490
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,000
It's not your responsibility.

491
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,800
First of all, I want to make a statement.

492
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm not a believer in Chen Duxiu.

493
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,280
It is true that I ideologically

494
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,960
agree with the New Culture Movement he advocated.

495
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,840
I support his proposal of science and democracy.

496
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,360
But I really don't know

497
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
what theory he believes in,

498
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,080
and I am a man of faith,

499
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,000
I respond to Wang Guangqi's call.

500
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,600
for this work-study mutual aid society experiment

501
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
because I have great hope for the work-study mutual aid society.

502
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,640
I have great hopes

503
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,560
I hope that the future society

504
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,720
can also become a work-study society.

505
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
But today I have to admit

506
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,320
our experiment failed.

507
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,480
What is the reason for the failure?

508
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,760
I haven't figured it out yet.

509
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
But what I know is

510
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,960
I will never give up

511
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,560
my pursuit of the ideal society

512
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,640
in my heart

513
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,760
because of the failure of a short experiment.

514
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,040
I believe

515
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,160
everyone here must be like me.

516
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,560
Even if what awaits us in front of us

517
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,080
is countless failures,

518
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,680
and we will definitely

519
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
go on steadfastly.

520
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,280
Where do I

521
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,200
propose to go from here?

522
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,800
Let's show our hands.

523
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
Comrades, let's show our hands.

524
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,360
Those who agree to dissolve the work-study mutual aid society raise their hands.

525
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
Okay, the results are in.

526
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,280
I declare

527
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,560
the first experimental group of the Beijing work-study mutual aid society

528
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,320
dissolved.

529
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,160
Let's clean up.

530
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,440
"Time flows like water,"

531
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,680
"Soon we shall depart from school,"

532
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,720
"We will ponder for a while"

533
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,480
"to understand today's homework,"

534
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:17,280
"Have we ever gone against our teacher?"

535
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,040
"Parents want children to come home,"

536
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
"We should not wander on the road"

537
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,800
"of leading the country's future and the world"

538
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,560
"which depends on our generation,"

539
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,400
"Everybody, let's work hard!"

540
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,720
"See you again tomorrow, classmates."

541
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
"Time flows like water,"

542
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,360
"Soon we shall depart from school,"

543
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,480
"We will ponder for a while"

544
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,520
"to understand today's homework,"

545
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,880
"Have we ever gone against our teacher?"

546
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,160
"Parents want children to come home,"

547
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
"We should not wander on the road"

548
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,840
"of leading the country's future and the world"

549
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,520
"which depends on our generation,"

550
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
"Everybody, let's work hard!"

551
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,200
"See you again tomorrow, classmates."

552
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,600
Comrades!

553
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
See you again tomorrow!

554
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,400
Comrades!

555
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,040
See you again tomorrow!

556
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,760
This plaque has been hanging for two months.

557
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
Still taking it off.

558
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
Guo, put it here.

559
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,840
Mr. Cai.

560
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,680
Gentlemen are here.

561
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,680
Here, steamed buns.

562
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,640
There are no Anhui dishes today.

563
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,440
No Shandong cuisine.

564
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,720
Only dumplings.

565
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
Okay, just dumplings.

566
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,960
What about today?

567
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,080
Let's have a chat with these dumplings.

568
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,120
Alright?

569
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,680
Okay, sit down.

570
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,040
Yu Xiusong, you start first.

571
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,000
Everybody sit down.

572
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,280
Sit down.

573
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,320
Dear Mr. Cai.

574
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:18,155
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

575
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,240
Dear mentors.

576
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,600
Dear ladies.

577
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,600
Dear comrades.

578
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,040
Today

579
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
was supposed to be a sad day for the members

580
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,560
of our work-study mutual aid society.

581
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,880
But because of Mr. Cai

582
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
and the arrival of the mentors,

583
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,880
it has become a memorable day again.

584
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:36,472
[Lu Xun, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

585
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
More than two months ago,

586
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
with the support and sponsorship of our mentors,

587
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,560
we started this work-study mutual aid society

588
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,480
and our members

589
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,600
are all

590
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
young men and women around 20 years old.

591
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
This is our first step towards life

592
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,520
is also the experience and pursuit

593
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,640
of our ideal life.

594
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,960
We persisted for more than two months.

595
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,800
We failed today.

596
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
We can't thank our mentors enough

597
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,680
for their support and teaching.

598
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,560
Let's ask Mr. Cai to give us a lecture.

599
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,800
Please sit down.

600
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm sorry.

601
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
There's been a lot going on at school these months.

602
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,280
I didn't care

603
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,120
about the work-study mutual aid society.

604
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,520
I was surprised to hear

605
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,320
that it was going to be disbanded.

606
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,880
I ran to see everyone.

607
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,160
I am concerned about the theory of mutual aid

608
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,960
and you are practicing it

609
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
with your own actions.

610
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,560
So you all are a lot better than me,

611
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
although in front of you,

612
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
I am the head of a school.

613
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,600
In this respect,

614
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
I want to learn from you.

615
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,760
I salute you young people

616
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,960
for your bravery.

617
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,000
I believe

618
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,040
your practice and experiment of mutual aid theory today

619
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,400
will become a valuable asset in your life.

620
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
I thank you sir for your approval and encouragement.

621
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,840
In the past two months,

622
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,920
we have tried our best

623
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,720
to do everything we can.

624
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,240
The experiment failed

625
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,920
but we have a clear conscience.

626
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,920
Today I would like to take this opportunity

627
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,840
to ask the gentlemen.

628
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,120
In your opinion

629
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,880
what is the root cause

630
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,840
of the failure of this mutual aid society?

631
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,400
You're good.

632
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,640
Failure without discouragement.

633
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,080
Keep a clear head and actively look for reasons.

634
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,560
In order to have the courage to move forward in the future

635
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,520
Isn't it?

636
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,400
Yes.

637
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
Good. Student Yannian, let me ask you first.

638
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,600
What do you think is the root of this failure?

639
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,240
I think there must be more than one reason.

640
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,440
But perhaps the most important thing is

641
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,480
that we don't understand

642
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
the theory and practice of mutual aid enough,

643
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,720
by either missing the point

644
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,920
or deviating from it.

645
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,920
What do you all think?

646
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
I think there are many disputes.

647
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
Brother Zhongfu, I suggest opening another column

648
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,320
for everyone

649
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,560
to properly summarize the experience and lessons learned.

650
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,760
What do you think?

651
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,960
Okay, Master Cai is right.

652
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,200
Then, on behalf of "New Youth",

653
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,680
I'll formally ask the members for a draft.

654
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,000
You have done a very useful experiment

655
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,800
for the youth of China.

656
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,040
Your summary and experience

657
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,560
is the most convincing.

658
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,160
At the same time,

659
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,960
I also want to ask Shouchang and Shizhi to write the manuscript.

660
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,920
Shizhi,

661
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
you tell everyone about your feelings.

662
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,720
I have studied work-study programmes.

663
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
In the United States,

664
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,800
tens of thousands of people live a work-study life.

665
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,360
But for young people in the United States

666
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,720
they are not interested in the work-study program.

667
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,080
They feel it is an extremely normal

668
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
and free choice.

669
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,680
It's not a great new life.

670
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,360
But in China,

671
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,200
it is an amazing thing.

672
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,560
As for us,

673
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,560
why did it fail after a few months?

674
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,240
There are many reasons.

675
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,280
I saw at least one of them.

676
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,440
It was not well planned.

677
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
Working more and studying less.

678
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,280
The result?

679
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,840
It's just that working is much more bitter.

680
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,640
The fun of studying is a little less.

681
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,640
Work-study.

682
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
Work. Study.

683
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
What is the relationship between the two?

684
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,680
Have you thought about it?

685
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,280
The purpose of working is to study.

686
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,880
And think about it.

687
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,000
Have we read many books in the past two months?

688
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
Do you have time to read?

689
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,680
Are there students

690
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,120
who have read less books than before

691
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,960
in the past two months?

692
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,920
There are.

693
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,880
So, our mutual aid society

694
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,800
has reversed the original intention.

695
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,280
How can it be successful?

696
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,400
It's not, Shizhi.

697
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,720
You are a well-fed man, but you don't know if a hungry man is hungry.

698
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,120
See?

699
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,720
This plaque has just been taken off.

700
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
Lu Xun writes very well.

701
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,920
To sweat on one's forehead,

702
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,080
than stain blood on one's hands.

703
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
Why do students do this experiment?

704
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
In order to rely on their own labor.

705
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,960
To maintain their studies.

706
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,760
Right?

707
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,680
So what's wrong with the students?

708
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,040
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

709
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,960
Shizhi, what you just said.

710
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,840
With no work, how can I finish my studies?

711
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,080
And with what to eat?

712
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,160
Aren't you throwing cold water on everyone?

713
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,000
Why am I pouring cold water on it?

714
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,000
Shouchang, since you say so,

715
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

716
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,840
My opinion is this:

717
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,800
to find the root of the failure of our mutual aid society,

718
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
first of all, we must recognize clearly

719
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,480
whether it is due to internal

720
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,080
or external causes.

721
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,000
Yannian, have you considered

722
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,440
the deeper reason?

723
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,960
What do you mean?

724
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,760
I mean, have you ever thought about

725
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,560
there is something wrong with the theory of mutual aid itself.

726
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,480
You mean there is something wrong with the theory of mutual aid itself?

727
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,520
Unscientific.

728
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,640
I think at least everyone

729
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,680
can study this problem.

730
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,280
There are two points.

731
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,480
First,

732
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,480
is the theory of mutual aid

733
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,840
a scientific theory?

734
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,600
Second,

735
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,760
is it suitable for China?

736
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,360
So what's your conclusion?

737
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,800
I think the success of the October Revolution in Russia

738
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
is more suitable for China than the theory of mutual aid.

739
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
Shouchang, you digress.

740
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
I think you are taking this opportunity

741
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,560
to promote the October Revolution

742
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,320
On this occasion,

743
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
it's not appropriate to talk about these things.

744
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,920
I disagree with you.

745
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
It's not, Shizhi.

746
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,800
I didn't take the opportunity to promote the October Revolution.

747
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm just offering a new idea

748
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,840
for everyone to discuss.

749
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
You don't mention the October Revolution.

750
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,880
You're against it, right?

751
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,600
There is no objection.

752
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,880
No, then how is it not contradictory?

753
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,680
On such an occasion today-

754
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,400
Shizhi, I think it just contradicts-

755
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,360
All right, all right, all right.

756
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,480
I have my opinion.

757
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,000
Students have their own opinions.

758
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
Brother Shouchang, Professor Shizhi.

759
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,080
What you two said makes sense to me.

760
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,480
Just don't discuss it here today.

761
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,400
Let's find a place another day

762
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,080
to have a good discussion.

763
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,640
Alright.

764
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,320
Come on.

765
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,160
Failure teaches success.

766
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,720
The end is the beginning.

767
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,960
Our task today

768
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,560
is to finish these buns.

769
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,480
Not just steamed buns

770
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,960
but also the pickles and garlic here all eaten,

771
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,600
until there is not a grain left in the clean canteen.

772
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,720
Come on.

773
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:29,466
Here.

774
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
Brother Shouchang, I really didn't object.

775
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,080
You two, eat the buns.

776
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm eating, Mr. Cai.

777
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,240
Do you really agree

778
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,000
to let them both go back to Shanghai?

779
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,360
Didn't you also read Liu Wenyao's letter?

780
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
It said that the places for work-study in France

781
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
were allocated to the French class of Aurora University,

782
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,160
and that the places in the French language training center in Beijing were finished.

783
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,160
If they want to go to France,

784
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,240
they have to go back to Shanghai to finish their studies

785
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,760
Obviously, he designed this in the morning.

786
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,600
These two boys really want

787
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,960
to go to France to work and study.

788
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,360
Then let them go back to Shanghai.

789
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,960
The mutual aid society failed.

790
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,880
It hit them both particularly hard.

791
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
Especially Yannian.

792
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,600
The child has a heavy heart.

793
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,600
I'm afraid he can't bear it.

794
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,320
These two children are now taking risks and struggling.

795
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
An indomitable time.

796
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,760
In particular, they needs hardship to be tempered.

797
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,520
Don't worry.

798
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,800
They have an old man like me.

799
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,480
Will these two kids be demoralized?

800
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,360
Yannian, Qiaonian.

801
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
Come out. I want to talk to you.

802
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,800
Dad,

803
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,560
you have to lecture again.

804
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,800
No, I'm just talking to you.

805
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
You are going to Shanghai.

806
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,600
Go get a chair and sit down.

807
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,960
I lifted up my head and said I was tired.

808
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,320
Yannian,

809
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,320
the mutual aid experiment failed.

810
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
I want to ask you, are you still so convinced

811
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,680
of the theory of anarchism?

812
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,960
Will you be angry if I say I firmly believe in it?

813
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,960
I won't.

814
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
Truth?

815
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,720
Truth.

816
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,920
Why?

817
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
Because I saw your reflection.

818
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,680
If you have reflection, you will not be blind.

819
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,280
I believe

820
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,960
you will surely find a right way.

821
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,560
I am willing to give you time.

822
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,040
I'm willing to go looking for it with you.

823
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,880
Thank you.

824
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,200
Dad, I thought you were going to force us again

825
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,640
to study the October Revolution.

826
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm not forcing you,

827
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,240
just suggesting.

828
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,680
Rest assured,

829
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,680
we will stick to the theory of mutual aid,

830
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,960
but we will

831
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,800
learn from different perspectives.

832
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,800
Good.

833
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,800
During my stay in Beijing,

834
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
I have seen your growth with my own eyes.

835
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,320
To tell the truth,

836
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,240
as a father, I am very pleased.

837
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,440
We also have a new understanding of you.

838
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,840
Your thoughts have also benefited me and Qiaonian a lot.

839
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,360
But there's just one thing.

840
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,920
What?

841
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,520
It's nothing.

842
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,840
We hope you will change

843
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,160
your style and habits,

844
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
especially when you treat your colleagues.

845
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,640
That would hurt them too much.

846
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,400
I'll fry some peanuts for you.

847
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,520
Take it back to eat on the road.

848
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,520
What are you doing?

849
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,080
The two children are going to Shanghai.

850
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,320
Can't I fry peanuts for them?

851
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,680
Go and get some pumpkin seeds.

852
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,640
Why?

853
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,560
When Qiaonian was a child, he liked fried peanuts.

854
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,760
Yannian likes to eat pumpkin seeds.

855
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,480
Pumpkin seeds and peanuts are cooked differently.

856
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
You'll fry it if you stir it up.

857
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,560
When Yannian was young,

858
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,680
he liked to eat fried pumpkin seeds.

859
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,280
You don't know this?

860
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,320
Think of this one?

861
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,240
It's a bit repetitive with what we published in the last issue.

862
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,200
So I suggest

863
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,920
this-

864
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,280
Shouchang, Zhongfu.

865
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,680
Shizhi.

866
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,960
Tell you some good news.

867
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,200
My teacher, Mr. Dewey, has decided

868
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,920
to come to China from Japan on the 27th to give lectures.

869
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,680
I'm here to ask for leave.

870
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,760
I want to meet my teacher in Shanghai.

871
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,840
I see you're happy.

872
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,200
The 27th is still a long way off.

873
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
Besides, at that time,

874
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,120
I should also step down as dean of liberal arts.

875
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
You don't have to ask me for leave.

876
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
What are you talking about?

877
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,240
You've always been my dean.

878
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,320
Dewey's coming to China is a good thing.

879
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,960
Although I don't fully agree with his

880
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,160
experimental viewpoint.

881
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,280
But his pragmatic ideas

882
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,720
are still refreshing.

883
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,440
Shizhi,

884
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,200
you, Jiang Menglin, and Tao Xingzhi

885
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,720
are his disciples.

886
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,080
You guys plan well.

887
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Let him stay in China for a few more days.

888
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,360
A couple more.

889
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,720
Now, Chinese people

890
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,520
have a good feeling for the United States and Wilson.

891
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
I told you,

892
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,880
we've been planning Mr. Dewey's trip

893
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,960
for more than a month.

894
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,760
I hope that my teacher's visit to China

895
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,840
will create a whirlwind

896
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,040
of experimentalism in China.

897
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
Because experimentalism is so useful to China,

898
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,960
China wants to be strong.

899
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,960
We must learn from the United States in its entirety.

900
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,560
Shizhi, that's biased.

901
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,160
How long has the United States been founded?

902
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,000
How many years is China's history?

903
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,680
The national conditions of the two countries are different.

904
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,800
Cultural traditions are different.

905
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,160
How can it be compared?

906
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
I agree with Shouchang.

907
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,480
But today?

908
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,160
I'd rather hope that the United States

909
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,840
can help us contain Japan.

910
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,840
So I wrote an article last month

911
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,240
praising this Wilson as a great man.

912
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
You still think so?

913
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,200
Now I call him Big Cannon

914
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
Big Cannon? What do you mean?

915
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,160
He fired a gun.

916
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,920
It's not like you didn't read

917
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,120
his fourteen peace proposals

918
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,320
Which one is not an empty gun?

919
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,440
Let me see.

920
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,760
China pins Shandong problem on him.

921
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,200
Concerning.

922
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,280
I think you two are too pessimistic.

923
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,280
I hope the facts don't make us pessimistic.

924
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,360
Mr. Cai.

925
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,000
Everyone's here.

926
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,120
Sir.

927
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,840
Mr. Cai.

928
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,120
Come on, sit down.

929
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,240
Please sit down.

930
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,120
I have something to tell you three.

931
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,520
Wang Daxie told me today.

932
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,840
He said that the Paris Peace Conference was not going well.

933
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,240
Japan which presented two documents

934
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,840
at the Paris Peace Conference.

935
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
One is, Duan Qirui,

936
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
in order to borrow money from the Japanese,

937
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,120
admitted that Japan

938
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,280
could inherit all the German rights and interests in Shandong

939
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
under a secret treaty.

940
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
What about the second one?

941
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,840
It's Britain, France and other countries

942
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,400
also acquiesced in such a treaty.

943
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,080
So now the Japanese are trying to force

944
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,840
the Americans into submission with these two documents.

945
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,240
So,

946
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,720
Wilson doesn't want this justice either.

947
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,280
Wang Daxie told me

948
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,760
the United States has always shared interests.

949
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,120
He must resist this request from Japan.

950
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,280
But to what extent can it be resisted?

951
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,720
It's hard to say.

952
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
Then Britain, France and Italy are unreliable.

953
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,560
The key is to look at this requirement of the United States for Japan.

954
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
What kind of plan will it come up with?

955
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,080
It's over.

956
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,240
Unreliable.

957
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
Who is unreliable?

958
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,800
I think Wilson is a gentleman.

959
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,160
Discussion is reliable.

960
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,520
Let's just leave it at that.

961
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,000
Now we have to take care of ourselves.

962
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,680
If something really big like this happens,

963
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,040
What will we do at Peking University?

964
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,280
Now Peking University is famous.

965
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,680
Zhongfu and Shouchang as well.

966
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,680
You're all on the police department's list.

967
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,080
More importantly, our students don't attend classes.

968
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
This heart can't be held back.

969
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,800
It's really the Paris Peace Conference that's going to go wrong.

970
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,440
That's bound to happen in China.

971
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,120
So I said,

972
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,520
brother Zhongfu, we have to plan ahead.

973
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Mr. Cai,

974
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,720
I think the current situation

975
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,920
is a good situation.

976
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,360
Everyone's patriotic enthusiasm

977
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,640
is all mobilized.

978
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,240
We just take advantage of the situation.

979
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,480
Mr. Cai, I don't think we can mess around.

980
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,560
This is the principle of guiding the situation according to the situation.

981
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,960
Zhongfu, why don't you talk?

982
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,280
I have to think about it.

983
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
You really have to think about it this time.

984
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,120
You can't go to extremes anymore.

985
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,880
No, Shizhi, how come you've been spending so much time lately

986
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,720
always talking about extremes?

987
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,760
You don't pour cold water on everyone.

988
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,040
Do you feel uncomfortable?

989
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,160
I didn't mean that.

990
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,080
I'm just saying what I think.

991
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,680
No offense, brother Zhongfu.

992
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm hungry. I'll be back to eat.

993
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,840
Is he angry?

994
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,640
Isn't that what it is?

995
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,960
Feudalism has grown up?

996
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,000
Mr. Cai,

997
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm- I'm also hungry.

998
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,480
I- I- I-

999
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm hungry. Me too.

1000
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,240
I also want to go eat.

1001
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,040
Yes, yes.

1002
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,760
Shouchang.

1003
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
Everyone's hungry. Everyone's hungry.

1004
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,240
Mr. Cai, can't I tell the truth?

1005
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,080
I just gestured to you, and you-

1006
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,600
Alright. Alright.

1007
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,480
Come on.

1008
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,560
I'll take you to the scholar's residence for dinner.

1009
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,680
Come on, my treat.

1010
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,880
You don't know.

1011
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,240
All countries are good.
