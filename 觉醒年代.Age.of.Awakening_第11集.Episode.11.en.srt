[Episode Eleven]

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,760
Now that we're back,

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,680
you shall know the difference.

[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,360
Mr. Gu,

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,600
This statement is also what I wish to deliver to you.

[Gu Hongming, styled Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

10
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,360
This statement...

11
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,320
is what I wish to deliver to everyone sitting here as well. 

12
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,960
This is a statement from us at Peking University 

13
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,640
towards an outdated China,

14
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,840
an outdated culture.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,360
And it is also a solemn statement of commitment 

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,760
to the successful future of Peking University!

[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,760
Dear seniors,

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,080
dear faculty members, 

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,560
dear students, 

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,920
Mr. Cai just asked:

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,280
"How would Peking University cope with such chaotic times?"

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,560
This is indeed the very question that we should 

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
contemplate with all our hearts and minds.

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,600
I remember in January of 1915.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
I talked to Zhu Kezhen (famous geologist and meteorologist) about 

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,400
our strong urge to establish prestigious universities within China. 

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,480
Later, I also talked to English teacher Yazhou about

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,080
the shame that we didn't have reputable universities. 

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,920
In my diary, I wrote that day,

31
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
I expressed my sincerest hope that

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,840
if one day, within China, 

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,160
there exists a distinguished university,

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,080
comparable to Harvard in the U.S., 

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,400
Oxford and Cambridge in the U.K.,

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,920
University of Berlin in Germany,

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,040
or University of Paris in France,

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,720
I'd be able to die without regrets.

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,240
The next day I still was pondering upon the same issue.

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
I wrote in my diary, 

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
the absence of national universities, 

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,760
national libraries,

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,560
national museums,

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,760
national art gallaries,

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,800
should all be regarded as disgraces of a nation.  

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,920
Today, I'm back eventually.

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,440
I, Hu Shi, have no other extravagant hopes other than

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
devoting my humble speech 

49
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,880
my diligent words

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,240
to the course of Peking University

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,960
in becoming one of the most esteemed universities in the world! 

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
Hi, have you seen Liu Haiwei and Fu Sinian anywhere?

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,160
They're over near the public notice board.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,640
Just over there.

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,200
Great, thanks!

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,520
Take one! Come one, take one!

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,040
They should not stay at Peking University anymore. 

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Dear students, we strongly urge the university to 

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,560
expel Gu Hongming,  

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,920
who aided Zhang Xun's restoration. 

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,120
That's right! We agree!

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,480
We cannot allow Peking University to become

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,560
a refuge for the remnants of Feudalist Qing Empire.

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,760
Yes, exactly!

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,760
We're already the Republic of China.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,720
People like Gu Hongming,

67
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
Can never stay here!

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,720
Sinian, Haiwei,

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
I finally found you guys!

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Guo,

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,760
Mr. Cai is hosting the meeting

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,720
for the school's appraisal committee members

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,920
Let's go find Mr. Cai.

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,320
Alright.

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
Students, let's all go talk to Mr. Cai!

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,200
Sure, let's go.

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
Sure, sure!

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,880
Let's all go together!

79
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,200
Go...

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Hurry...

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,040
Dear appraisal committee members,

82
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,240
the meeting we have today... 

83
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,960
Mr. Cai.

84
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,520
Mr. Cai, we have some request to seek your opinion.

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
Wait a moment, the faculties are having a meeting right now.

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,960
We'd like to meet with Mr. Cai.

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
Students, please do not interrupt the meeting. 

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,040
Be quiet.

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,480
We're not trying to cause any trouble, sir.

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,440
We're exercising our rights 

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
as per Mr. Cai's earlier appeal.

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,520
Indeed!

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
You have no right to stop us from seeing Mr. Cai.

94
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,600
You have no right...

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,960
As you can see...

96
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Dean Chen Duxiu, please sit down.

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
Please excuse me for a second, I'll go take a look.

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,840
Mr. Cai is here!

99
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,120
Greetings, Mr. Cai!

100
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,480
Dear fellow students,

101
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,760
What requests do you have? Please let me know.

102
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Mr. Cai, we'd like you to dismiss

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
the accomplice of Zhang Sun -- Gu Hongming. 

104
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Right! Drive him out of Peking University!

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
Do you have any concrete evidences of 

106
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,200
Gu Hongming colluding with Zhang Xun's Restoration?

107
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,200
Sir, the newspaper said so!

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,960
Yes, we've read it from the newspaper.

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Exactly, we've all seen it!

110
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,000
In conducting scholarly research, we shouldn't parroting others' words.

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,280
This is the Peking University academic discipline I have repeatedly emphasized.

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,000
I know what's on your mind.

113
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm aware of your opinions.

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,480
However, your petition has to 

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,200
go through the formal decision making process of the school's appraisal committee. 

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
My individual words won't count.

117
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
What I can do though is to reliably  

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,240
deliver your petition

119
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,000
to the appraisal committee.

120
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,640
So please go back to your studies for now.

121
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,160
Is that alright?

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
Mr. Cai, in that case, we request to observe the meeting.

123
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,080
Yes.

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
Indeed, we wish to observe.

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,320
Please allow us to observe.

126
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
Huh, this is unheard of!

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
But even for this matter,

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,920
it still has to be approved by the committee.

129
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,280
Please wait here for a bit.

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,840
Alright.

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,960
Sounds good, Sir.

132
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,520
Thank you, Sir.

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,640
I assume you have heard everything.

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
Please express your views.

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,640
How can we allow this?

136
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Having students participate school committee meeting,

137
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
This is not appropriate.

138
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,360
What would it bring to the dignity of the school (faculties)?

139
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,760
We can absolutely not set a precedent!

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
Once a bad example is set,

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,840
there will be the second, third time. 

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,880
again and again...

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,360
How can we deal with that?

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,840
Dr. Hu Shi, what's your opinion on this?

145
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,920
Dear committee members,

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
In order to reflect the authority 

147
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
of our school appraisal committee,

148
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,240
we can invite students to observe. 

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,640
In order to demonstrate the academic rigor and discipline

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,000
of our meeting,

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,520
We can ask the students

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
to select two to three representatives among themselves

153
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
to be the observers.

154
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
The rest of them can go back to classes.

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
I agree with Dr. Hu.

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,640
I agree.

157
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,440
I think Dr. Hu's suggestion is brilliant. 

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay, let's follow Dr. Hu's advice.

159
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,240
Guo,

160
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,240
Please have two to three representatives among yourselves to observe the meeting.

161
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,040
Is that okay?

162
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
Sure!

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,280
Let's make a decision.

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,080
How about you three?

165
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Why not.

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,230
We'll wait for the good news from you guys.

167
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,640
We'll wait for the good news from you guys. Alright.

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,040
Sir,

169
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
We're the three representatives elected.

170
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,320
Great, let's welcome the three non-voting delegates.

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160
Thank you, sir. 

172
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,160
The rest of you, please go back first. 

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Thank you and goodbye, sir.

174
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,680
Let's go.

175
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Let's go then.

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,840
Mr. Cai.

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,800
Alright,

178
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
according to the students' request,

179
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480
we're going to discuss whether or not

180
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,840
we should dismiss Prof. Gu Hongming.

181
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Please express your own views.

182
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,000
He's extremely knowledgeable (in his field).

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
We do need to make this decision carefully.

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
Dean Chen,

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
Since this is mostly a matter within Liberal Arts,

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
Would you talk about it first?

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
With regard to whether 

188
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,000
Gu Hongming is adequate for the professorship,

189
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,120
within Liberal Arts, we do have two apposing views.

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
On one hand, some believe that

191
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,000
Gu Hongming participated in Zhang Xun's Restoration, 

192
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,240
which brought disgrace to the teachers. Therefore should be dismissed.

193
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,000
On the other hand, others maintain that 

194
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,920
The hiring of professors should rely upon their teaching credentials 

195
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,040
rather than whether or not they support the restoration. 

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
We have surveyed our faculty members,

197
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,240
and found out that roughly same number of people were on each side. 

198
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
Therefore, this time, we didn't list 

199
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,760
Gu Hongming among personnel to be dismissed.

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,880
Mr. Cai,

201
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,640
and dear colleagues,

202
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,480
I wish to vouch for Gu Hongming.

203
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,240
As far as I know,

204
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Gu was dragged along to the performance by Zhang Xun.

205
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,269
[Zhang Shizhao, styled Xingyan, Professor at Peking University]

206
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
He had no idea of the Restoration beforehand.

207
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,200
Even though, he did meet the "empire" at the palace,

208
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,920
as for appointing him to be the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs,

209
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,520
that's complete rumor. 

210
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
When he came to complain to me a couple of days ago,

211
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
he was full of regrets and grievances. 

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
He's in his 60s now.

213
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
And he has a bunch of costly problems and habits.

214
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
If we're to take away his incomes, 

215
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
it's equivalent to killing him.

216
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,960
I think we'd better show some leniency and let him off.

217
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
Gu supports the Monarchy,

218
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,560
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Professor at Peking University]

219
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,880
and brings disgrace to us teachers. 

220
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,560
Why should we still keep people like this?

221
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's kick him out!

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Yes, I agree!

223
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,600
How can we kick him out?

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,320
The key to Gu's matter,

225
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,360
is to determine whether he used the Peking University classrooms 

226
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,640
to incite students to support the Restoration and oppose the Republic.

227
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,680
If that's not the case, we have no reason to dismiss him.

228
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
Facts speak louder than words!

229
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Gu dishonored scholarship!

230
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,280
Gu is indeed supporting the Restoration!

231
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,000
Isn't that true?

232
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
We cannot dismiss him.

233
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
He did do that.

234
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,080
Let's listen to Mr. Cai.

235
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,960
Please sit down.

236
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
Our student delegates.

237
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,240
May I ask if you have any evidences (of Gu supporting the Restoration)?

238
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
Sir, we don't.

239
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,680
Okay, please sit down.

240
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
But, when Gu gives his lectures here,

241
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
Nobody wants to attend. 

242
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
The British Poetry course he teaches, 

243
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
only covers 6 poems and a few stanzas.  

244
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,480
Typically, only 1 to 2 students would show up to his lectures. 

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,280
Dear teachers, there're 365 days in a year,

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
but he only teaches 6 poems plus a dozen of lines.

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
How many words would that be?

248
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
If we do the maths, students probably are not even learning one word per day!

249
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,040
How can there be people as lazy as this!

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,320
This is wasting students time.

251
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,600
We have to kick him out!

252
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,080
Aye! Aye!

253
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
Wasting students' time!

254
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,680
I agree!

255
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
Alright, it seems clear now.

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
Gu Hongming has issues regarding his teaching credentials.

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I petition the committee 

258
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
to allow me to give Gu Hongming

259
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
a disciplinary counseling.

260
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,280
Let's give him a month.

261
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,800
Within a month,

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,680
If students are still willing to attend his lectures,

263
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
then we continue to hire him.

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
If students are not acknowledging his effort,

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
then we dismiss him.

266
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040
Would you all agree?

267
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,640
Agreed.

268
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,240
Now that we resolved this issue,

269
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880
our 3 student delegates, please feel free to leave.

270
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
We're to discuss the next item on our meeting.

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,760
Sing Peking Opera "First drum, prepare battle food"

272
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,920
"Second drum, tighten the armor"

273
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
"Third drum, knife out of sheath"

274
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
"Fourth drum, be at war"

275
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000
"The ones marched forward all get rewarded"

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
"The ones backed off inevitably injured"

277
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:37,840
"The three armies returned to the camp with the commander"

278
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,400
"The famous general Lian Po" 

279
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,840
"Is he still strong and intrepid, despite his age?"

280
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,280
Master, you look worried. 

281
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,880
Liu Er,

282
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
how many years have you served me?

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,520
Ever since Puyi abdicated, 

284
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,440
if it was not you master, who took me in,

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,720
where else would I end up?

286
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
If I can no longer stay at Peking University,

287
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
where else can you go?

288
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,200
Mater, what are you talking about?

289
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm in the twilight of my life...

290
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
I don't really care about where I may end up.

291
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,640
Not to mention, I owe you a debt of gratitude for your recognition. 

292
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Mater, wherever you go,

293
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,840
me, Liu Er, would go too.

294
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,320
San Er.

295
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,040
Mater.

296
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,040
Prepare the sedan, I'll go get some Southern pastries from Daoxiangcun (Famous Pastry shop in Beijing).

297
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,240
Master, you can just hand over this type of errands to me.

298
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
No, I insist on going myself.

299
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Mr. Cai,

300
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,400
Prof. Gu is here.

301
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,320
Please.

302
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
My esteemed Mr. Cai,

303
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,360
I'm here to pay my respect to you.

304
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,840
Tangsheng, there you are.

305
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,400
Why did you bring these?

306
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,600
I know that Mr. Cai is from the South,

307
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,080
and misses Southern food.

308
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,800
So I went to Daoxiangcun by myself today,

309
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,960
and brought you some pastries from Jiahu.

310
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,080
Please give them a try.

311
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
Brother Tangsheng, you didn't have to do this.

312
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
I know that you are not well-off yourself.

313
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,160
Not to mention you are a big spender.

314
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,840
Please accept my gratitude, Brother Tangsheng.

315
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,680
You're too polite.

316
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,120
Please come over and sit down.

317
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,800
No need,

318
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,560
No need to trouble you.

319
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,920
I brought my own tea.

320
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520
Well, please sit down then.

321
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920
Tangsheng.

322
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
This is the first-class tea from my hometown.

323
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,880
Please give it a taste.

324
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,640
Thank you, thank you.

325
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,680
Please sit.

326
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,080
Thank you.

327
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
Tangsheng, I should have gone to your place

328
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,040
to pay you a visit. 

329
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,440
It's all because I was too caught up 

330
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,320
in the affairs of the university.

331
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,760
That's why I invited you to come here instead.

332
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm now talking to you on behalf of

333
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,400
the school appraisal committee. 

334
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,280
Please go ahead, Mr. Cai.

335
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
Tangsheng, let me ask you this:

336
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
If you're to leave Peking University,

337
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,640
would you be willing?

338
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,280
No, I won't.

339
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
Of course I won't.

340
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
Why?

341
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720
Mr. Cai, our nation is plunged in chaos. 

342
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,640
I, Gu Hongming,

343
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360
have nowhere else to turn to except Peking University. 

344
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,640
In that case, 

345
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
please don't take what I'm about to say as mere threats.

346
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,080
I'd really appreciate that you think it over carefully and seriously.

347
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm all ears.

348
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,640
The university's top priority for now,

349
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,160
is to recruit talents from all parts of the nation,

350
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
and to dismiss disqualified mediocrities.

351
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480
This is the key point of our conversation.

352
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
As for you Gu Tangsheng,

353
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,520
there're loads of controversies around you both within and outside of our campus.

354
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,560
The petition for terminating your contract,

355
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,480
is now supported by many.

356
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,120
May I ask you, Mr. Cai,

357
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Do you consider me, Hongming, as a disqualified mediocrity? 

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
Mediocrity -- not necessarily. 

359
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,280
But, as for being disqualified, we do have solid proof.

360
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320


361
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240


362
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720


363
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,640


364
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,080
