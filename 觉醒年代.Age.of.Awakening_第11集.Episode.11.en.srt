[Episode Eleven]

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,760
Now that we're back,

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,680
you shall know the difference.

00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,360
Mr. Gu,

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,600
This statement is also what I wish to deliver to you.

[Gu Hongming, styled Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

10
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,360
This statement...

11
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,320
is what I wish to deliver to everyone sitting here as well.

12
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,960
This is a statement from us at Peking University

13
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,640
towards an outdated China,

14
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,840
an outdated culture.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,360
And it is also a solemn statement of commitment

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,760
to the successful future of Peking University!

[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,760
Dear seniors,

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,080
dear faculty members,

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,560
dear students,

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,920
Mr. Cai just asked:

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,280
"How would Peking University cope with such chaotic times?"

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,560
This is indeed the very question that we should

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
contemplate with all our hearts and minds.

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,600
I remember in January of 1915.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
I talked to Zhu Kezhen (famous geologist and meteorologist) about

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,400
our strong urge to establish prestigious universities within China.

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,480
Later, I also talked to English teacher Yazhou about

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,080
the shame that we didn't have reputable universities.

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,920
In my diary, I wrote that day,

31
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
I expressed my sincerest hope that

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,840
if one day, within China,

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,160
there exists a distinguished university,

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,080
comparable to Harvard in the U.S.,

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,400
Oxford and Cambridge in the U.K.,

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,920
University of Berlin in Germany,

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,040
or University of Paris in France,

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,720
I'd be able to die without regrets.

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,240
The next day I was still pondering upon the same issue.

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
I wrote in my diary,

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
the absence of national universities,

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,760
national libraries,

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,560
national museums,

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,760
national art gallaries,

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,800
should all be regarded as disgraces of a nation.

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,920
Today, I'm finally back.

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,440
I, Hu Shi, have no other extravagant hopes other than

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
devoting my humble speech,

49
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,880
my diligent words,

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,240
to the path of Peking University

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,960
in becoming one of the most esteemed universities in the world!

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
Hi, have you seen Liu Haiwei and Fu Sinian anywhere?

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,160
They're over near the public notice board.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,640
Just over there.

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,200
Great, thanks!

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,520
Take one! Come one, take one!

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,040
They should not stay at Peking University anymore.

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Dear students, we strongly urge the university to

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,560
expel Gu Hongming,

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,920
who aided Zhang Xun's restoration.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,120
That's right! We agree!

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,480
We cannot allow Peking University to become

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,560
a refuge for the remnants of the feudalist Qing Empire.

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,760
Yes, exactly!

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,760
We're already the Republic of China.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,720
People like Gu Hongming,

67
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
can never stay here!

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,720
Sinian, Haiwei,

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
I finally found you guys!

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Guo,

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,760
Mr. Cai is hosting the meeting

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,720
for the school's appraisal committee members

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,920
Let's go find Mr. Cai.

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,320
Alright.

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
Students, let's all go talk to Mr. Cai!

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,200
Sure, let's go.

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
Sure, sure!

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,880
Let's all go together!

79
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,200
Go...

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Hurry...

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,040
Dear appraisal committee members,

82
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,240
the meeting we have today...

83
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,960
Mr. Cai.

84
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,520
Mr. Cai, we have some request to seek your opinion.

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
Wait a moment, the faculties are having a meeting right now.

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,960
We'd like to meet with Mr. Cai.

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
Students, please do not interrupt the meeting.

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,040
Be quiet.

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,480
We're not trying to cause any trouble, sir.

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,440
We're exercising our rights

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
as per Mr. Cai's earlier appeal.

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,520
Indeed!

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
You have no right to stop us from seeing Mr. Cai.

94
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,600
You have no right...

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,960
As you can see...

96
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Dean Chen Duxiu, please sit down.

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
Please excuse me for a second, I'll go take a look.

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,840
Mr. Cai is here!

99
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,120
Greetings, Mr. Cai!

100
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,480
Dear fellow students,

101
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,760
What requests do you have? Please let me know.

102
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Mr. Cai, we'd like you to dismiss

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
the accomplice of Zhang Sun -- Gu Hongming.

104
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Right! Drive him out of Peking University!

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
Do you have any concrete evidences of

106
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,200
Gu Hongming colluding with Zhang Xun's Restoration?

107
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,200
Sir, the newspaper said so!

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,960
Yes, we've read it from the newspaper.

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Exactly, we've all seen it!

110
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,000
In conducting scholarly research, we shouldn't parroting others' words.

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,280
This is the Peking University academic discipline I have repeatedly emphasized.

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,000
I know what's on your mind.

113
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm aware of your opinions.

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,480
However, your petition has to

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,200
go through the formal decision making process of the school's appraisal committee.

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
My individual words won't count.

117
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
What I can do though is to reliably

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,240
deliver your petition

119
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,000
to the appraisal committee.

120
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,640
So please go back to your studies for now.

121
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,160
Is that alright?

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
Mr. Cai, in that case, we request to observe the meeting.

123
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,080
Yes.

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
Indeed, we wish to observe.

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,320
Please allow us to observe.

126
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
Huh, this is unheard of!

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
But even for this matter,

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,920
it still has to be approved by the committee.

129
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,280
Please wait here for a bit.

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,840
Alright.

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,960
Sounds good, sir.

132
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,520
Thank you, sir.

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,640
I assume you have heard everything.

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
Please express your views.

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,640
How can we allow this?

136
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Having students participate school committee meeting,

137
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
This is not appropriate.

138
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,360
What would it bring to the dignity of the school (faculties)?

139
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,760
We can absolutely not set a precedent!

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
Once a bad example is set,

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,840
there will be the second, third time.

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,880
again and again...

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,360
How can we deal with that?

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,840
Dr. Hu Shi, what's your opinion on this?

145
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,920
Dear committee members,

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
In order to reflect the authority

147
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
of our school appraisal committee,

148
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,240
we can invite students to observe.

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,640
In order to demonstrate the academic rigor and discipline

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,000
of our meeting,

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,520
We can ask the students

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
to select two to three representatives among themselves

153
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
to be the observers.

154
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
The rest of them can go back to classes.

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
I agree with Professor Hu Shi's opinion.

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,640
I agree.

157
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,440
I think Dr. Hu Shi's suggestion is brilliant.

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay, let's follow this advice.

159
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,240
Student Guo,

160
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,240
Please have two to three representatives among yourselves to observe the meeting.

161
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,040
Is that okay?

162
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
Sure!

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,280
Let's make a decision.

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,080
How about you three?

165
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Why not.

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,230
We'll wait for the good news from you guys.

167
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,640
We'll wait for the good news from you guys. Alright.

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,040
Sir,

169
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
We're the three representatives elected.

170
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,320
Great, let's welcome the three non-voting delegates.

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160
Thank you, sir.

172
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,160
The rest of you, please go back first.

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Thank you and goodbye, sir.

174
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,680
Let's go.

175
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Let's go then.

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,840
Mr. Cai.

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,800
Alright,

178
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
according to the students' request,

179
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480
we're going to discuss whether or not

180
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,840
we should dismiss Professor Gu Hongming.

181
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Please express your own views.

182
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,000
He's extremely knowledgeable (in his field).

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
We do need to make this decision carefully.

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
Dean Chen,

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
Since this is mostly a matter within Liberal Arts,

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
Would you talk about it first?

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
With regard to whether

188
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,000
Gu Hongming is adequate for the professorship,

189
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,120
within Liberal Arts, we do have two apposing views.

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
On one hand, some believe that

191
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,000
Gu Hongming participated in Zhang Xun's Restoration,

192
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,240
which brought disgrace to the teachers. Therefore should be dismissed.

193
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,000
On the other hand, others maintain that

194
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,920
the hiring of professors should rely upon their teaching credentials

195
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,040
rather than whether or not they support the restoration.

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
We have surveyed our faculty members,

197
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,240
and found out that roughly same number of people were on each side.

198
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
Therefore, this time, we didn't list

199
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,760
Gu Hongming among personnel to be dismissed.

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,880
Mr. Cai,

201
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,640
and dear colleagues,

202
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,480
I wish to vouch for Gu Hongming.

203
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,240
As far as I know,

204
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Gu was dragged along to the performance by Zhang Xun.

205
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,269
[Zhang Shizhao, styled Xingyan, Professor at Peking University]

206
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
He had no idea of the Restoration beforehand.

207
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,200
Even though, he did meet the "empire" at the palace,

208
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,920
as for appointing him to be the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs,

209
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,520
that's a complete rumor.

210
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
When he came to complain to me a couple of days ago,

211
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
he was full of regrets and grievances.

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
He's in his 60s now.

213
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
And he has a bunch of costly problems and habits.

214
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
If we're to take away his incomes,

215
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
it's equivalent to killing him.

216
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,960
I think we'd better show some leniency and let him off.

217
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
Gu supports the monarchy,

218
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,560
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Professor at Peking University]

219
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,880
and brings disgrace to us teachers.

220
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,560
Why should we still keep people like this?

221
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's kick him out!

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Yes, I agree!

223
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,600
How can we kick him out?

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,320
The key to Gu Tangsheng's matter,

225
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,360
is to determine whether he used the Peking University classrooms

226
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,640
to incite students to support the Restoration and oppose the Republic.

227
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,680
If that's not the case, we have no reason to dismiss him.

228
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
Facts speak louder than words!

229
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Mr. Tangsheng dishonored scholarship!

230
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,280
Gu Hongming is indeed supporting the Restoration!

231
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,000
Isn't that true?

232
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
We cannot dismiss him.

233
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
He did do that.

234
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,080
Let's listen to Mr. Cai.

235
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,960
Please sit down.

236
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
Our student delegates.

237
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,240
May I ask if you have any proof?

238
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
Sir, we don't.

239
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,680
Okay, please sit down.

240
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
But, when Gu Hongming gives his lectures at Peking University,

241
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
nobody wants to attend.

242
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
The British Poetry course he teaches,

243
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
only covers 6 poems and a few stanzas.

244
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,480
Typically, only 1 to 2 students would show up to his lectures.

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,280
Dear teachers, there're 365 days in a year,

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
but he only teaches 6 poems plus a dozen of lines.

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
How many words would that be?

248
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
If we do the maths, students probably are not even learning one word per day!

249
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,040
How can there be people as lazy as this!

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,320
This is wasting students time.

251
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,600
We have to kick him out!

252
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,080
Aye! Aye!

253
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
Wasting students' time!

254
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,680
I agree!

255
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
Alright, it seems clear now.

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
Gu Hongming has issues regarding his teaching credentials.

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I petition the committee

258
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
to allow me to give Gu Hongming

259
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
a disciplinary counseling.

260
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,280
Let's give him a month.

261
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,800
Within a month,

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,680
If students are still willing to attend his lectures,

263
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
then we continue to hire him.

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
If students are not acknowledging his effort,

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
then we dismiss him.

266
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040
Would you all agree?

267
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,640
Agreed.

268
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,240
Now that we resolved this issue,

269
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880
our 3 student delegates, please feel free to leave.

270
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
We're to discuss the next item on our meeting.

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,760
"First drum, prepare battle food"

272
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,920
"Second drum, tighten the armor"

273
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
"Third drum, knife out of sheath"

274
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
"Fourth drum, be at war"

275
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000
"The ones marched forward all get rewarded"

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
"The ones backed off inevitably injured"

277
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:37,840
"The three armies returned to the camp with the commander"

278
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,115
"The famous general Lian Po"

279
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,840
"Is he still strong and intrepid, despite his age?"

280
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,280
Master, you look worried.

281
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,880
Liu Er,

282
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
how many years have you served me?

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,520
Ever since the Xuantong Emperor abdicated,

284
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,440
if it was not you master, who took me in,

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,720
where else would I end up?

286
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
If I can no longer stay at Peking University,

287
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
where else can you go?

288
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,200
Master, what are you talking about?

289
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm in the twilight of my life...

290
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
I don't really care about where I may end up.

291
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,640
Not to mention, I owe you a debt of gratitude for your recognition.

292
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Master, wherever you go,

293
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,840
I, Liu Er, would go too.

294
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,320
San Er.

295
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,040
Master.

296
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,040
Prepare the car, I'll go get some Southern pastries from Daoxiangcun (famous pastry shop in Beijing).

297
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:47,997
Yes.

298
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,240
Master, you can just hand over this type of errands to me.

299
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
No, I insist on going myself.

300
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Mr. Cai,

301
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,400
Professor Gu is here.

302
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,320
Please.

303
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
My esteemed Mr. Cai,

304
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,360
I'm here to pay my respect to you.

305
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,840
Tangsheng, there you are.

306
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,400
Why did you bring these?

307
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,600
I know that Mr. Cai is from the South,

308
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,080
and misses Southern food.

309
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,800
So I went to Daoxiangcun by myself today,

310
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,960
and brought you some pastries from Jiahu.

311
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,080
Please give them a try.

312
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
Brother Tangsheng, you didn't have to do this.

313
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
I know that you are not well-off yourself.

314
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,160
Not to mention you are a big spender.

315
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,840
Please accept my gratitude, Brother Tangsheng.

316
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,680
You're too polite.

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,120
Please come over and sit down.

318
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,800
No need,

319
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,560
No need to trouble you.

320
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,920
I brought my own tea.

321
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520
Well, please sit down then.

322
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920
Tangsheng.

323
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
This is the first-class tea from my hometown.

324
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,880
Please give it a taste.

325
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,640
Thank you, thank you.

326
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,680
Please sit.

327
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,080
Thank you.

328
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
Tangsheng, I should have gone to your place

329
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,040
to pay you a visit.

330
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,440
It's all because I was too caught up

331
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,320
in the affairs of the university.

332
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,760
That's why I invited you to come here instead.

333
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm now talking to you on behalf of

334
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,400
the school appraisal committee.

335
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,280
Please go ahead, Mr. Cai.

336
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
Tangsheng, let me ask you this:

337
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
If you're to leave Peking University,

338
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,640
would you be willing?

339
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,280
No, I won't.

340
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
Of course I won't.

341
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
Why?

342
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720
Mr. Cai, our nation is plunged in chaos.

343
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,640
I, Gu Hongming,

344
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360
have nowhere else to turn to except Peking University.

345
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,640
In that case,

346
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
please don't take what I'm about to say as mere threats.

347
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,080
I'd really appreciate that you think it over carefully and seriously.

348
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm all ears.

349
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,640
The university's top priority for now,

350
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,160
is to recruit talents from all parts of the nation,

351
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
and to dismiss disqualified mediocrities.

352
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480
This is the key point of our conversation.

353
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
As for you Gu Tangsheng,

354
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,520
there are many controversies around you both within and outside of our campus.

355
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,560
The petition for terminating your contract,

356
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,480
is now supported by many.

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,120
May I ask you, Mr. Cai,

358
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
do you consider me, Gu Hongming, as a disqualified mediocrity?

359
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
Mediocrity -- not necessarily.

360
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,280
But, as for being disqualified, we do have solid proof.

361
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
Then, I still want to ask

362
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240
Mr. Cai's current favorite, Hu Shizhi,

363
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
he is only a second-rate doctor

364
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,640
yet can still run amuck at Peking University.

365
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,080
I, Gu Hongming, have countless academic titles,

366
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,760
gathered a distinguished reputation,

367
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,240
but hold no place at Peking University.

368
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,960
What kind of reform is this?

369
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
What sense does this make?

370
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,160
At Peking University, you taught

371
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,720
a year of British Poetry class.

372
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,480
You only taught six poems.

373
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,520
Most of the time,

374
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,480
you were talking about your monarchism.

375
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,160
Students can be counted on one's fingers.

376
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,000
Could it be that this is not a fact?

377
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,360
One-to-one-education:

378
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,440
that is not my, Gu Hongming's, invention

379
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,200
The British professor Kedley,

380
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,400
when he is teaching

381
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,960
the classroom is always empty.

382
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Isn't he still the highest paid?

383
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,240
Then let me tell you,

384
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,880
Kedley is the number one foreign professor that

385
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,200
Peking University wants to dismiss.

386
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,720
Do you understand now?

387
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,800
Mr. Cai,

388
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,200
you truly want to dismiss me?

389
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
Peking University's school council

390
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,000
seriously looked into your issue.

391
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,120
They want me to have a honest talk with you,

392
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,440
and give you one month's time

393
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,320
to have students return to your classroom.

394
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,920
Otherwise,

395
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,960
you will lose your qualifications to teach at Peking University.

396
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,040
After leaving Peking University,

397
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,960
Tangsheng, where else will you still have a place to stand?

398
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,320
Mr. Cai!

399
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,400
You scared me to death!

400
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,800
Isn't it just getting students to come attend my lecture?

401
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
So easy!

402
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm afraid that Peking University doesn't have a classroom that big!

403
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,960
Tangsheng, are you sure you can be this confident?

404
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
Starting from next week,

405
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
I want to set up a series of lectures at Peking University.

406
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,680
The subject is discussing the Spirit of Chinese People!

407
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
At that time, if there are no students coming to attend,

408
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,480
I don't need the school to dismiss me,

409
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,920
I'll resign myself.

410
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,360
Are these words true?

411
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,800
A gentleman's words are no joking matter.

412
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm willing to pledge a warrior's oath.

413
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,600
Mr. Cai, other people laugh at me for being too insane,

414
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
I laugh at them for not being able to see through.

415
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,680
My, Gu Hongming's, sincere patriotic heart,

416
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,880
in all four corners of the world, only you, Mr. Cai, and I know.

417
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,960
Our schools in China teach people right from wrong,

418
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
to stimulate beauty and goodness,

419
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,440
and to abide by morality.

420
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,080
This is my Daoist rite.

421
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,840
I can't leave it.

422
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,440
I can't!

423
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,120
I

424
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,720
Brother Tangsheng,

425
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,960
what you just said now,

426
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
is precisely what I wanted to hear.

427
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
I will wait and see.

428
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:10,005
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang]

429
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,520
Li Dazhao

430
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,960
deeply observed Chinese society in southern China.

431
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
The suffering in the lives of the underprivileged

432
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
gave him an enormous shock.

433
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,120
It drove him to reflect

434
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,320
on the way of Chinese bourgeois revolution,

435
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,160
and to re-explore

436
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,760
new ways of Chinese democratic revolution.

437
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,440
A series of lectures. The Spirit of Chinese people

438
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,080
Lecturer Gu Hongming

439
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:44,880
Time:

440
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,600
Afternoon, 3rd to 6th October 1917

441
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,920
Location: Peking University Liberal Arts Small Auditorium

442
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,600
3rd October, First lecture:

443
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,560
The Spirit of Chinese People

444
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
4th October, Second lecture: The Language of China

445
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
5th October, Third lecture: The Women of China

446
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,080
6th October, Fourth lecture: Chinese Thought

447
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
Welcoming current teachers and students to enthusiastically join.

448
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
Old Guo, I heard Professor Gu

449
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,920
is now in Dongjiaomin Lane

450
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
giving foreigners a talk about the Spirit of Chinese People.

451
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
A ticket is two silver dollars.

452
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
It's even more expensive than Mei Lanfang's ticket price.

453
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,840
Is it true?

454
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,720
That's made up!

455
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,360
When this Gu Hongming is lecturing at Peking University, no one attends at all.

456
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,800
Still selling tickets?

457
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,840
It's true.

458
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,840
When I was a private tutor at a foreigner's house at Dongjiaominxiang,

459
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,360
Professor Gu's reputation was pretty big.

460
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,400
They all said,

461
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
coming to China you don't need to see the Three Great Halls,

462
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,440
but you can't not see Gu Hongming.

463
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,400
You see.

464
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,360
This has never-

465
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,007
Mr. Zhongfu!

466
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,157
Greetings Mr. Zhongfu

467
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,600
Greetings Mr. Xingyan

468
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,240
Sir, sir.

469
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,160
Look, Gu Hongming wants to start a series of lectures now.

470
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
He's not going to use the lectures to promote monarchism again, is he?

471
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,680
Don't talk nonsense.

472
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,280
Professor Gu is going to teach knowledge.

473
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,400
Whatever he's going to talk about,

474
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,000
just go attend, then you will know right?

475
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
Sir, can I attend?

476
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,720
Although Peking University doesn't admit female students right now,

477
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,720
but these type of academic lectures should allow them.

478
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,480
Students,

479
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
I hope everybody will be able to go attend.

480
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,920
This series of lectures with Gu Tangsheng

481
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,680
is really hard to get tickets outside!

482
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay, we will go for sure.

483
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,560
Good.

484
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,360
Take care sirs.

485
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:15,920
Goodbye

486
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,960
Take care sirs.

487
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:42,320
Make way!

488
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,880
Everyone go listen!

489
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,160
We know, sir. Okay!

490
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,240
Let's go.

491
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,720
Let's go, Old Guo.

492
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,440
Keep going, keep going.

493
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,040
Come. Hurry.

494
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,120
Quickly go sit at the front.

495
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,000
Sit at the front.

496
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm here. Here, here, here.

497
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,040
Come sit here. Sit here.

498
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,840
Isn't it?

499
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,080
It's hard to get a ticket in the embassy district.

500
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,360
I heard it's like plain boiled water.

501
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,320
Dull.

502
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,280
Go to the front to sit.

503
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,600
It's here, it's here.

504
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Students, I know what you all are laughing at.

505
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,040
You're laughing at this queue on my head.

506
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,560
Everyone look!

507
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,920
What is so laughable about queues?

508
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
This is our Chinese culture.

509
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320
A root that cannot be cut off.

510
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,560
All the seated students,

511
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,600
it doesn't matter if you are willing to listen,

512
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,960
as long as you guys recognize you are Chinese,

513
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,680
you will be attached to this queue.

514
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,480
The only difference between us is that

515
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,320
my queue is tangible, put on top of my head,

516
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,800
your queues are intangible,

517
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
concealed in your hearts.

518
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,960
Don't at all think that after cutting off hair,

519
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,120
after wearing Western clothes,

520
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,440
have our mouths full of English,

521
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,320
foreigners will think highly of us.

522
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,760
On the contrary.

523
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,280
When a Chinese person

524
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,360
westernizes into a foreigner,

525
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,800
it will precisely arouse their contempt.

526
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,040
Only by letting them see

527
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,480
that we Chinese people,

528
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,800
have their own distinctive spirit

529
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,480
and civilization,

530
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,640
only then in their hearts will they have

531
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
genuine respect for us.

532
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,160
Okay. Next, I will start my lecture.

533
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,960
Students, today the lecture topic

534
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,800
is the Spirit of Chinese People.

535
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,360
This topic, I have lectured foreigners many times on.

536
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,280
But the lectures I give them,

537
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,120
everyone has to purchase a two silver dollar ticket.

538
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,000
Furthermore, I determined not to give them opportunities to interrupt

539
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,680
and raise questions!

540
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
Of course, today is different.

541
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
I am in Peking University's auditorium,

542
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
giving my own students a lecture.

543
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
This is both my lecture

544
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,040
and also an exchange among us.

545
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,280
You guys can interrupt me at any time.

546
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
You guys can raise any questions.

547
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,720
I will definitely give you guys a satisfying answer.

548
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,920
What is the Spirit of Chinese People?

549
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,880
As everyone knows, in the current world,

550
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
every country,

551
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,520
every ethnicity all have their own spirit.

552
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,200
For example, Americans,

553
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,440
they are honest, broad,

554
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,680
but they are not profound.

555
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,440
The British

556
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,760
honest, profound,

557
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,400
but they are not broad.

558
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,960
The Germans. Broad, profound.

559
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,120
But no honesty.

560
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,560
I heard some foreigner friends tell me

561
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,000
the longer they reside in China,

562
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,200
the more they like Chinese people.

563
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,880
Why is this?

564
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,172
Why?

565
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:41,362
Why?

566
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,288
Why?

567
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,120
Yeah! Why?

568
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,560
Why? Why is it?

569
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,761
Why is it?

570
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,160
Yeah! Why?

571
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,400
Why? Why? Why?

572
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,840
Mr. Gu, stop keeping us in suspense.

573
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,480
Why is it?

574
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,920
Sir, don't keep us in suspense.

575
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
Quickly tell us why!

576
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,440
Don't keep us in suspense!

577
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,240
Why is it?

578
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,600
Say it!

579
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,280
Why is it?

580
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
Quickly say it!

581
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
Why?

582
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,560
Quickly say!

583
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,400
Okay.

584
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,560
Now, I will start answering your questions.

585
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,960
We Chinese people,

586
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
our thoughts, our dispositions

587
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,040
have a lot of weak points.

588
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,480
However, we Chinese people

589
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,320
have what no other group has,

590
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,560
the thing hard to put into words,

591
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,440
that is gentleness and kindness.

592
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,760
What is gentleness and kindness?

593
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,480
Right.

594
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,360
I really don't know.

595
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,040
Student Guo Xingang.

596
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,520
You come answer this question.

597
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Replying to what you just said, I think

598
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,560
gentleness and kindness is meekness and weakness.

599
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,560
Gentleness and kindness is not a good disposition

600
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,600
and precisely reflects a defect

601
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,360
in the Chinese people's physique and morality.

602
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,080
No, no no!

603
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,720
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

604
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,080
Gentleness and kindness is not meekness,

605
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,640
even more it is not weakness.

606
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,880
Gentleness and kindness is a kind of strength.

607
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,560
It's a force of sympathy

608
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
and human wisdom.

609
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,920
I'll tell you guys a secret.

610
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,400
The reason why we Chinese people have the power of sympathy,

611
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
is because we completely,

612
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,640
thoroughly exist in a

613
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,040
spiritual life.

614
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,920
This is how we are different from the foreigners.

615
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,720
The entire life of Chinese people

616
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
is a kind of sentimental life.

617
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
It's a kind of sentiment that comes from the deepest part of a human.

618
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,960
It's spiritual passion

619
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,600
and the feeling of the love for mankind.

620
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
Professor Gu,

621
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,840
could you elaborate on it?

622
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120
I'll give you an example.

623
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
Why do we, Chinese people, have remarkable memory abilities

624
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,760
compared to the Europeans?

625
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,000
It's because the Chinese people

626
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,160
are living a mental life.

627
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,760
We live with our hearts.

628
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,080
Using empathy and the power of the heart to memorize

629
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,040
is far better than using one's head.

630
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,120
The latter is simply boring and tedious.

631
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,800
Let me give you another example.

632
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
Chinese people are more courteous than most people from other countries.

633
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,320
This is widely acknowledged across the world.

634
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,560
What is the essence of courtesy?

635
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,920
It is sympathy, empathy, the sensitivity towards the feelings of the others.

636
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,680
The Chinese courtesy comes deep down from one's heart.

637
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,680
Chinese people understand their own feelings and emotions.

638
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,520
On top of that, they have the ability to put themselves in other people's shoes.

639
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,200
Their behavior reflects their care and thoughtfulness.

640
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760
Of course, the Japanese people are also known to be courteous.

641
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,440
I personally believe though,

642
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,360
Their courtesy is rather like a scentless flower.

643
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,440
Coming from our hearts, the courtesy of our Chinese people

644
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,160
is a type of exquisite and precious perfume

645
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,680
that carries lasting fragrance.

646
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,000
Bravo!

647
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,080
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

648
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,640
Professor Gu, so what you're trying to say is

649
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,720
what sets Chinese people apart from the foreigners is that

650
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,080
Chinese people rely on their hearts

651
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,520
while the foreigners rely on their heads, correct?

652
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,880
You can say it that way.

653
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,840
I, Gu Hongming, was born in South Ocean (i.e., Southeast Asia), learned in Western Ocean (i.e., Western world),

654
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,960
married in East Ocean (i.e., Japan), and served in North Ocean (i.e. the Beiyang Government).

655
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,560
But I have always been

656
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,320
an upright and dignified Chinese.

657
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,280
Now, let me unravel this secret.

658
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,440
What is a real Chinese?

659
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:03,029
A real Chinese

660
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,080
is a person with the heart of a child

661
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,760
and the mind of an adult.

662
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
A real Chinese person enjoys the mental life.

663
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
The spirit of Chinese people thus

664
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,800
remains youthful.

665
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,880
The secret to the imperishable spirit of Chinese people

666
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,440
lies in the perfect harmony

667
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,720
uniting their sense and sensibility.

668
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,400
I, Gu Hongming, will forever devote my life

669
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,440
to the development and spread of such magnificent spirit.

670
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,480
For such ideal I hold dear to my heart, I'd not regret a thousand times to die.

671
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:47,520
Bravo! Bravo!

672
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,160
Dean Chen Duxiu,

673
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,520
do you have any questions?

674
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,880
No question,

675
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,960
but a request.

676
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,200
Is it possible for Professor Gu to change the venue of tomorrow's lecture

677
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,600
to the big school yard?

678
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,960
Of course!

679
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:30,640
Awesome! Great!

680
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,640
Gu Tangsheng is indeed out of the ordinary!

681
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,440
The four days of lectures he gave are extremely popular and inspiring.

682
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,120
Nowadays, apart from us, other colleges in Beijing

683
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,000
are sharing an upsurge of interest in...

684
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,720
Greetings, Mr. Cai.

685
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,680
Greeting, everybody.

686
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,280
... the spirit of Chinese people.

687
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,360
Zhang Shizhao told me yesterday that

688
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,600
Gu Hongming had turned into "The Whirlwind Gu" nowadays.

689
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,440
Even though I couldn't agree with

690
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,640
certain aspects of his views.

691
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,560
But his lectures successfully demonstrated

692
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,320
his solid academic grounding.

693
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,440
I sincerely admire his talents.

694
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,240
Shizhi.

695
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,920
Greetings. Greetings.

696
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,360
For advocates of New Culture Movement

697
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,520
like us,

698
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,360
The views of Gu Hongming

699
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,960
are great reminders.

700
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,080
He reminds us that

701
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,600
the New Culture advocates

702
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,200
should avoid extremes.

703
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,400
Fairly speaking,

704
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,680
if we evaluate Professor Gu's views

705
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,240
from an academic standpoint,

706
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
we can hardly criticize anything.

707
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,000
Instead, we can totally benefit from his ideas.

708
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,840
Unfortunately, he tends to use his scholarly research

709
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,200
as a platform

710
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,600
to express his political affiliations

711
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,400
and his support for restoration.

712
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,600
That's the detrimental part.

713
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,120
You see, for his recent two lectures,

714
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,680
he's advocating monarchism again, intentionally or unintentionally.

715
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,560
Nice! Mr. Cai!

716
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,920
Gu Hongming,

717
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
is an eccentric talent, a literature maniac.

718
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
If he's not going too far, don't argue with him.

719
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,920
But what you brought up just now

720
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,040
is also an important issue.

721
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,560
Zhongfu said

722
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,920
Peking University should not

723
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
become a political platform for the royalists.

724
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,560
What do you think?

725
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,600
I've been thinking about the same question.

726
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
But I don't really have a concrete answer yet.

727
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,880
Zhongfu also suggested

728
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,800
that you should give lectures at Peking University

729
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,280
on New Culture and literature revolution.

730
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
New Culture has its own system and construct.

731
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,440
I'm afraid I won't do it justice, if I'm doing it alone.

732
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,680
But if we bring tother all the co-editors

733
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,520
of "New Youth",

734
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,960
and unit every individual's strengths and expertise

735
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,040
to hold a series of lectures on New Culture,

736
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,120
it must be extremely useful.

737
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,360
This is a great idea.

738
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,160
Let's go talk to Zhongfu.

739
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,440
Very well, Mr. Cai!

740
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,640
It was Shizhi who proposed

741
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,960
the idea of New Culture Movement

742
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,040
lecture series.

743
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,760
I personally appreciate this idea.

744
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
You're the initiator of New Culture Movement.

745
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,240
"New Youth" is the platform of New Culture.

746
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
Now that we have both the leaders and the journal here,

747
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,280
Peking University is undoubtedly the cradle of New Culture.

748
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,480
We can also put it this way,

749
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,760
New culture is the voice of new Peking University.

750
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,440
Or a banner.

751
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,160
You and Shizhi are both editors...

752
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,360
Here, here

753
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,400
Alright.

754
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:10,960
Pass it to me.

755
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,880
Although the editorial commission is not formally established yet,

756
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,240
the co-editors

757
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,200
are mostly going to be those of you in Liberal Arts.

758
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,080
All set, thanks!

759
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,080
Plus Li Dazhao,

760
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,920
Zhou Shuren, and Zhou Zuoren.

761
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,720
Right!

762
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,720
Shouchang is to become the director of Peking University Library soon.

763
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,560
We have to get him started right away.

764
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,720
Zhou Shuren still has his appointments within Ministry of Education.

765
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,560
He's only working part timely at Peking University.

766
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,320
As for Zhou Zuoren,

767
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,120
he will start working as a professor at Peking University soon.

768
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,080
Would you mind gathering up these people

769
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,640
so that they become the principle force of New Culture?

770
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,200
Understood.

771
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,840
Bother Shouchang,

772
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,880
Fortuntaly, Beijing

773
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,280
have safely survived the disastrous Zhang Xun Restoration.

774
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,440
Peking University resumed teaching recently and everything is back to normal.

775
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,680
With the strong recommendation of Zhang Shizhao,

776
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,320
you're now formerly appointed

777
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
Director of Peking University Library.

778
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,760
I hope you'll come back to Beijing to take the post soon after you receive this letter.

779
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,040
Sincerely.

780
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,284
[Nanjing]

781
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,720
Mr. Dazhao!

782
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,520
Mr. Bai!

783
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,880
Why did you invite me all the way here?

784
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,640
Please sit down.

785
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,360
Mr. Dazhao, good news!

786
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,240
Jiangsu Province Military Governor Li Chun has decided

787
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,640
to appoint you his legal consultant.

788
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,320
Your duty would be handling affairs

789
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,240
affairs with Japan.

790
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,000
He also is planning on

791
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,680
sending you to Japan for a field trip.

792
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,280
This is a lucrative post!

793
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,440
Congratulations, Mr. Dazhao!

794
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,640
Mr. Bai,

795
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,040
I invited you here to say goodbye to you.

796
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,960
I'm going back to Beijing.

797
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,240
Going back to Beijing?

798
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,800
In such turmoil and chaos of war,

799
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,240
why on earth are you going back to Beijing?

800
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,600
I have already discussed with Governor Li

801
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,200
we're going to get all your family members

802
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,880
to Nanjing.

803
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,720
This is a once in a blue moon opportunity.

804
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
Your fortune turned.

805
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,800
I have took an oath that

806
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
I will never work for the government.

807
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,640
Not to mention our nation is facing grave crisis,

808
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
I'd better do something

809
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,600
that I believe is truly meaningful.

810
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,960
Why are you doing this to yourself, Mr. Dazhao?

811
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,120
Shop owner,

812
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,880
Here's the money for the tea.

813
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,000
Thank you for your support and recommendation, Mr.Bai.

814
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,880
Don't mention it.

815
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,400
Mr. Dazhao,

816
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,000
You have to think it through carefully!

817
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,200
I'm leaving.

818
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,520
During his field trip to Jiangnan,

819
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,520
though criticizing pseudo-syncretism,

820
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,280
pseudo-statism,

821
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,840
and Liang Qichao's reformism,

822
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,040
Li Dazhao gradually abandoned his

823
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,480
illusions about Western democracy and parliamentary politics.

824
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,240
He proposed the following:

825
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,160
towards reactionary violent regimes

826
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,920
like Yuan Shikai's and Dean Qiruan's,

827
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,720
good-willed citizens should have the right to start revolutions.

828
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,880
On 11 November,

829
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,640
Li Dazhao resolutely rejected

830
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,480
the opportunity to work for the government based on his friend's recommendation,

831
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,720
and returned to Beijing.

832
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,840
He set out on the new route

833
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,480
and took on the mission of ideological enlightenment and social revolution.

834
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:21,065
[Beijing]

835
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,560
Shouchang, you're finally back!

836
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,480
I'm so happy that I get to see you as soon as I get back.

837
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,840
Let me introduce you

838
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,360
Professor Hu Shi.

839
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,760
He came specifically in admiration for your fame.

840
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,160
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hu Shi.

841
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,640
Nice to meet you.

842
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,520
I have long been looking forward to meeting you.

843
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,560
Thank you, Shiyan.

844
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
Shouchang, as long as you're back.

845
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,640
The co-editing of "New Youth"

846
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,080
may officially begin now!

847
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,840
You'll be in charge for the next issue, how about that?

848
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,400
I happen to have contemplated so much in the last 100 days and got so much to say!

849
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
Great! What's on your mind, share with us!

850
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,840
It's a long story.

851
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,680
If you're interested,

852
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,800
the two of us can chat all night long!

853
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,760
The THREE of us.

854
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,200
Today, the three of us shall drink ourselves to oblivion!

855
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Awesome!

856
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,400
I can't wait!

857
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,400
I've always wished to hear Mr. Shouchang's profound opinion.

858
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,920
I won't call it profound,

859
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,000
but it's all going to be the thoughts and reflections based on my personal experience from the 100-day trip.

860
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,920
I have the feeling that our New Culture Movement

861
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,520
shoulnd't be limited to

862
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,000
ideiological enlightenment among the elites.

863
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,360
We also need to transform the entire society.

864
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:19,760
Brother Zhongfu,

865
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:19,840
with all due respect,

866
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,000
Brother Zhongfu, with all due respect,

867
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,800
Brother Zhongfu, with all due respect,

868
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,680
I found your earlier statement

869
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,040
"No mentioning of politics in 20 years"

870
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,240
to be too impractical.

871
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,400
Shouchang, the gathering we have today

872
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,280
might turn into a debate!
