00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240


238
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480


239
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,480


240
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,280


241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760


242
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280


243
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600


244
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,040


245
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,320


246
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,600


247
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,080


248
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200


249
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,680


250
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080


251
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200


252
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760


253
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160


254
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000


255
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,280


256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,800


257
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,680


258
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040


259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880


260
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040


262
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,640


263
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,240


264
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,760


267
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,920


268
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000


269
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920


270
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,400


296
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,320

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,360

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,840


300
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,400


301
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,600

00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,680

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,120

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,800

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,560


314
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,920


315
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520


316
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920


317
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,880


319
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,640


320
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,680


321
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,080


322
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000


323
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,040


324
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,440


325
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,320


326
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,760


327
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,960


328
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,400


329
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,280


330
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560


331
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920


332
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,640


333
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,280


334
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440


335
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560


336
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720


337
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,640


338
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360


339
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,640


340
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880


341
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,080


342
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,960


343
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,640


344
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,160


345
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400


346
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480


347
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400


348
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,520


349
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,560


350
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,480


351
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,120


352
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680


353
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200


354
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,280


355
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
Then, I still want to ask

356
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240
Sir Cai's current favorite, Hu Shizhi.

357
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
He is only a (?)

358
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,640
yet can still run amuck at Peking University.

359
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,080
I, Gu Hongming, have countless academic titles (?)

360
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,760
Accumulated reputation (?)

361
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,240


362
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,960
What kind of reform is this?

363
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
What sense does this make? 

364
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:30,157
At Peking University, you taught

365
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,720
A year of English poem class (?)

366
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,480
You only taught six poems.

367
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,520
Most of the time

368
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,480
you are talking about your monarchism.

369
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,160
Students can be counted on one's fingers.

370
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,000
Could it be this is not a fact?

371
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,360


372
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,440
That is not my, Gu Hongming's (?)

373
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,200
British professor, Kedelai

374
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,400
when he is teaching

375
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,960
the classroom is always empty.

376
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Isn't he still the highest paid? (?)

377
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,240
Then let me tell you

378
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,880
Kedelai is the number one foreign professor that

379
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,200
Peking University wants to dismiss.

380
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,720
Do you understand now?

381
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,800
Sir Cai

382
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,200
you truly want to dismiss me?

383
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
Peking University's school council

384
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,000
seriously looked into your issue.

385
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,120
They want me to (?)

386
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,440
Give you one month's time 

387
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,320
to have students return to your classroom.

388
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,920
Otherwise,

389
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,960
You will lose your qualifications to teach at Peking University

390
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,040
After leaving Peking University,

391
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,960
Tangsheng, where will you still have a place to stand (?)

392
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,320
Sir Gong

393
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,400
You scared me to death!

394
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,800
Isn't it just getting students to come listen to my lesson?

395
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
So easy!

396
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm afraid that Peking University doesn't have a classroom that big!

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,960
Tangsheng, you can be confident like this (?)

398
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
Starting from next week,

399
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
I want to set up a series of lectures.

400
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,680
The subject is discussing The Spirit of Chinese People!

401
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
At that time, if there are no students coming to attend,

402
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,480
I don't need the school to dismiss me,

403
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,920
I'll resign myself.

404
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,360
These words are serious (?)

405
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,800
A gentleman's words are no joking matter. (?)

406
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm willing to set up a military order. (?)

407
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,600
Sir Cai, other people laugh at me for being too insane,

408
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
I laugh at them for not being able to see through.

409
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,680
I, Gu Hongming, sincerely love the country (?)

410
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,880
East, west, south, north, it's only you Sir Gong who knows me (?)

411
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,960
Our schools in China teach people right from wrong,

412
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
arouse beautiful and virtuous feelings (?),

413
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,440
a place where ethics are complied with. (?)

414
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,080
This is my Daoist rite (?)

415
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,840
I can't leave it.

416
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,440
Not able to!

417
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,120
I

418
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,720
Brother Tangsheng

419
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,960
What said just now

420
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
is precisely what I wanted to hear.

421
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
I will wait and see.

422
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,520
Li Dazho

423
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,960
deeply observed Chinese society in southern China.

424
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
The lowest class of people's life of suffering (?)

425
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
gave him an enormous shock.

426
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,120
It drove him to start looking at

427
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,320


428
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,160
Re-explore

429
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,760
a new way for China's road of bourgeois revolution (?)

430
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,440

It's even more expensive than Mei Lanfang's ticket price.

446
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,840
Is it true?

447
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,720


448
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,360
When this Gu Hongming is lecturing at Peking University, no one attends at all.

449
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,800
Still selling tickets?

450
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,840
It's true.

451
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,840
When I was a private tutor at a foreigner's house at Dongjiaominxiang (?) 

452
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,360
Professor Gu's reputation was pretty big (?)

453
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,400
They all said

454
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
Coming to China you don't need to see the Three Great Halls, 

455
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,440
but you can't not see Gu Hongming.

456
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,400
You see.

457
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,360
This has never-

458
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,957
Mr. Zhongfu

459
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,071
Greetings Mr. Zhongfu 

460
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:35,600
Greetings Mr. Xingyan

461
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,240
Sir, sir.

462
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,160
Look, Gu Hongming wants to start a series of lectures now.

463
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
He's not going to borrow the lectures to promote autocratic monarchy again is he? (?)

464
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,680
Don't make irresponsible remarks (?)

465
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,280
Professor Gu is going to talk about knowledge. (?)

466
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,400
What he's going to talk about

467
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,000
just go attend, then you will know right?

468
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
Sir, can I attend?

469
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,720
Although Peking University doesn't recruit female students right now,

470
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,720
but these type of academic lectures should be allowing it. (?)

471
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,400


472
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,480
Students,

473
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
I hope everybody will be able to go have a listen

474
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,920
this series of lectures of Gu Tangsheng at the outside (?)

475
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,680
the tickets are indeed like gold dust. (?)

476
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay, we will go for sure.

477
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,560
Good.

478
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,360
Take care sirs.

479
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:15,920
Goodbye

480
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,960
Take care sirs.

481
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:42,320
Make way!

482
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,880
Everyone go listen!

483
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,160
We know, sir.  Okay!

484
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,240
We're leaving. (?)

485
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,720
Let's go, Old Guo.

486
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,440
Going, going, going. (?)

487
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,040
Come. Hurry.

488
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,120
Quickly go sit at the front.

489
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,000
Sit at the front.

490
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm here. Here, here, here.

491
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,040
Come sit here. Sit here.

492
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,840
Isn't it?

493
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,080
At the embassy area, the tickets really are like gold dust. (?)

494
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,360
I said it's like plain boiled water. (?)

495
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,320
Dull.

496
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,280
Go to the front to sit.

497
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,600
It's here, it's here.

498
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Students, I know what you guys are laughing at.

499
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,040
You're laughing at this plait on my head.

500
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,560
Everyone look!

501
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,920
What is so laughable about plaits?

502
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
This is our Chinese culture.

503
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320


504
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,560
All the seated students,

505
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,600
it doesn't matter if you are willing to listen,

506
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,960
as long as you guys recognize you are Chinese,

507
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,680
you will be attached to this plait (?)

508
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
It's just that what's different between us is

509
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,320
My plait is tangible, put on top of my head.

510
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,800
Your plaits are intangible,

511
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
concealed in your heart.

512
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,960
Don't at all think that after cutting off hair,

513
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,120
after wearing Western clothes,

514
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,440
have our mouths full of English,

515
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,320
foreigners will attach importance to us.

516
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,760
Just the opposite.

517
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,280
As a Chinese person,

518
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,360


519
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,800
it will precisely arouse their contempt.

520
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,040
Only by letting them see

521
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,480
us Chinese people,

522
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,800


523
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,480


524
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,640
only then in their hearts will they have

525
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
genuine respect for us.

526
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,160
Okay. Next, I will start my lecture. 

527
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,960
Students, today the lecture topic 

528
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,800
is The Spirit of Chinese People.

529
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,360
This topic, I have lectured foreigners many times on.

530
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,280
But the lectures I give them,

531
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,120
everyone has to collect a 2 silver dollar ticket.

532
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,000
Furthermore, I determined not to give them opportunities to interrupt

533
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,680
and raise questions!

534
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
Of course, today is different.

535
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
I am in Peking University's auditorium,

536
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
giving my own students a lecture.

537
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
This is both my lecture

538
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,040
and also an exchange among us.

539
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,280
You guys can interrupt me at any time.

540
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
You guys can raise any questions.

541
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,720
I will definitely give you guys a satisfying answer.

542
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,920
(?) the Spirit of Chinese People

543
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,880
As everyone knows, in the current world,

544
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
every country,

545
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,520
every ethnicity all have their own spirit.

546
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,200
For example, Americans

547
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,440
they are simple and honest, broad (?)

548
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,680
but they are not profound (?).

549
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,440
The British

550
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,760
simple and honest, profound,

551
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,400
but they are not broad enough (?)

552
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,960
The Germans. Broad. Profound.

553
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,120
But they have no simplicity and honesty.

554
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,560
I heard some foreigner friends tell me

555
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,000
the longer the reside in China,

556
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,200
the more the like Chinese people.

557
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,880
Why is this?

558
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,240
Why?

559
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,120
Right. Why?

560
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,560
Why? Why is it?

561
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,120
Why is it?

562
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,400
Why? Why? Why?

563
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,840
Mr. Gu, stop keeping us in suspense.

564
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,480
Why is it?

565
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,920
Sir, don't keep us in suspense.

566
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
Quickly tell us why!

567
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,440
Don't keep us in suspense!

568
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,240
Why is it?

569
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,600
Say it!

570
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,280
Why is it?

571
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
Quickly say it!

572
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
Why?

573
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,560
Quickly say!

574
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,400
Okay.

575
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,560
Now, I will start answering your questions.

576
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,960
Us Chinese people

577
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
the ideologies, disposition

578
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,040
have a lot of weak points.

579
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,480
However, on our person (?)

580
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,320
We have what no other group has,

581
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,560
the thing hard to put into words,

582
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,440
that is gentleness and kindness.

583
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,760
What is gentleness and kindness?

584
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,480
Right.

585
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,360


586
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,040
Student Guo Xingang

587
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,520
You come answer this question.

588
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Replying to what mister has said, this student thinks (?)

589
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,560
Gentleness and kindness is (?)

590
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,560
Gentleness and kindness is not a good disposition (?)

591
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,600


592
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,360


593
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,080
No, no no.

594
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,720
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

595
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,080
Gentleness and kindness is not meekness,

596
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,640
even more it is not cowardly.

597
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,880
Gentleness and kindness is a kind of strength.

598
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,560
It's a kind of sympathy

599
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
and humankind's powerful knowledge. (?)

600
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,920
I'll tell you guys a secret。

601
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,400
The reason why us Chinese people have the power of sympathy (?)

602
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
is because we completely,

603
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,640
thoroughly exist in a 

604
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,040


605
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,920
This is how we are different from the foreigners. (?)

606
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,720
The entire life of Chinese people

607
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
is a kind of sentimental life. (?)

608
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
It's a kind of sentiment that comes from the deepest part of a human.

609
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,960
It's spiritual passion (?)

610
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,600
and the feeling of the love for mankind. (?)

611
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080


612
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,840


613
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120


614
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080


615
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,760


616
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,000


617
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,160


618
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,760


619
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,080


620
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,040


621
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,120


622
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,800


623
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760


624
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,320


625
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,560


626
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,920


627
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,680


628
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,680


629
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,520


630
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,200


631
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760


632
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,440


633
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,360


634
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,440


635
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,160


636
