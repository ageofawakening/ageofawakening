I do not agree

[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Professor at Peking University]

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,400
with Professor Hu's viewpoint.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,920
I just heard that Professor Hu Shi said that it is more convenient and effective

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
to remove the complicated and simplify the vernacular

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,240
compared with classical Chinese. 

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,640
This is not true.

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,400
Let me give you an example,

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,040
such as the death of your wife.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,760
When her family telegrams you in vernacular,

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,800
Your wife is dead. Come back quickly. 

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,120
This is eleven words.

15
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,245
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,520
If you use classical Chinese, you only need to say

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,320
"Wife's funeral, return quickly". Only four words!

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,840
The telegram fee can be reduced by two thirds.

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,360
Dare I ask Professor Hu

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,480
whether you advocate the vernacular language

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,240
or the ancient language of our old ancestors:

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
classical Chinese?

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,480
Good!

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,440
Well said!

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,000
Well said!

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,760
Well said!

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,200
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Huang said just now

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,440
that it costs more to send messages in vernacular. 

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,600
I disagree.

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
That's because Mr. Huang doesn't know

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,440
how to use vernacular correctly. 

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,960
Yes, that's right.

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,480
We can do a quick experiment. 

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,160
For example,

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,160
a friend of mine from the Ministry of Education

36
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,520
sent me a message two days ago. 

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,280
He invited me to be an administrative secretary. 

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
I didn't wanted to go into politics and decided not to go. 

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,640
On this matter, I would like to ask Mr. Huang Kan

40
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,080
to help me write a message of rejection in classical Chinese,

41
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,880
while I will write a message in vernacular Chinese. 

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,480
Compare the two

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,400
to see which is more refined and economical. 

44

[Lin Shu, styled Qinnan]

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,000
What do you say, everyone? 

46
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,120
Good!

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
Good.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
My message consists of twelve words. 

49
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,280
Crude and unlearned,

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,480
fearful of incompetence,

51
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,840
cannot bear to obey.

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,040
Clear and concise!

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
Accurate! Perfectly accurate!

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Professor Huang just used twelve words,

55
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,760
which is really concise. 

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,040
Does anyone else here

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
have less than twelve words?

58
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,680
If not,

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,560
then I will announce the message in vernacular. 

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,720
Can't do it. Thank you.

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,320
Finished.

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,880
Great!

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,280
Well said!

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
Great!

65
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:42,528
Crude!

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,640
Crude and unbearable!

67

Well said!

68
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,760
Your message is neither literary

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,880
nor polite. 

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
It doesn't express the meaning of my message at all. 

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
It's a disgrace to scholars!

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,120
I don't think so. 

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,240
"Can't do it" contains both "crude and unlearned"

74
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,240
and "fearful of incompetence".

75
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,240
And the "thank you" I used

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
expressed my gratitude to my friends for taking the trouble to recommend me,

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,480
which also implies rejection. 

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
If such a message can save money,

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
words and ideas,

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,880
why doesn't everybody use it?

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,840
Exactly!

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,040
From this, we can see whether language is concise or not

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,520
is not the difference between vernacular and classical Chinese,

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,040
but whether words

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,880
can be properly selected. 

86
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,320

Agreed!

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
Forgetting the ancestors!

96

Spreading fallacies to deceive the people!

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
Disgracing one's scholarly dignity!

98
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,520
Heartless and insane!

101
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,040
You write the proposal quickly. 

102
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,920
Call the Qing government to purge Peking University. 

103
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,560
Replace Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu.

104
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,800
Expel Qian Xuantong and Hu Shi. 

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,200
If we do not purge,

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
Peking University will become a breeding ground

107
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
of national subjugation and extinction!

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,480
Yes, yes, yes.

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,840
Master, sit down, don't worry.

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,600
Master, sit down.

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,720
Master, don't worry.

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
Students are preparing 

113
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,040
to stamp out Cai Yuanpei's and Chen Duxiu's proposal. 

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,560
but the amount of materials is not enough at present. 

115
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
This is the crime of cultural destruction.

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,200
The crime of national extinction!

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,320
Master, don't worry.

118
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
I'm afraid it will be difficult

119
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,320
to pass the proposal rashly. 

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080
What did you say?

121
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
Didn't you just watch them lead

122
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,560
young people to evil ways,

123
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,520
and let them destroy this country? 

124
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
Master, don't worry.

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,480
How can you say this sentence? 

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,760
Master.

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,480
No!

128
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,040
Master. There are some ways,

129
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,880
but please come out in person.

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
Draw the snake out of its hole.

131
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,440
What do you mean?

132
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,120
Teacher, judging from the current situation,

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,280
these people at Peking University

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
are all ideological extremists. 

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,560
If you always go out in person and light a torch,

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
they will be annoyed. 

137
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,000
Then surely they will do

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
more outrageous things. 

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
In this way, we can catch the fox's tail

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
and be sure to win. 

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,880
Uncle.

142
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,720
I think our strategy is wrong. 

143
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,920
You always say that Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei are not to be taunted. 

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
If you don't mess with him, he will bully you. 

145
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,880
I think that if you want

146
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,160
to fight back,

147
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,240
you have to target Chen Duxiu first.

148
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,960
Don't be afraid.

149
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,000
What did you say?

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,040
The competition among intellectuals should always be open and above the board

151
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,400
Such mean tricks you guys are pulling are nothing an upright scholar would consider doing

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,680
How dare you come up with such shameless plans?

153
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,800
No!

154
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,920
Master, do not worry!

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
Master!

156
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
Master, listen!

157
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
Well, nicely spoken.

158
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,320
Chen Duxiu is a fanatic. 

159
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
Grab this guy, chase after him,

160
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,520
and beat down the arrogance of these people. 

161
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,560
Go do it.

162
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
I will give you financial support. 

163
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,480
Master!

164
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,680
Master, don't get angry!

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
Calm down!

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,840
Master, you are right. 

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
We should be open and upright. 

168
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,840
We won't do it. 

169
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,720
We quit!

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,840
Master, listen to me. 

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,240
Let's not do it. 

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,680
We won't do it, master.

173
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
Master, don't worry.

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,960
Master, don't worry...

175

Peking University Liberal Arts Students:

176
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,640
Chen Duxiu's personal morality was corrupted.

177
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,520
During his exile in Japan, he acted as a traitor,

178
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,920
advocating that patriotism is criminal and treason is glorious.

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,000
Who wrote this? 

180
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,040
Who posted this? 

181
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,640
Whoever wrote it, I think it's true. 

182
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,320
It's true!

183
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,040
Students! Students!

184
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,480
That's who he is,

185

if that's true. 

186
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,280
Mr. Chen Duxiu,

187
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,040
he is too unbearable. 

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,760

Everyone, stop!

Mr. Huang.

194

Sir, take a look.

195
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,040
Mengzhen,

196
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
Take a look.

197
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
This is the New Culture standard-bearer you admire. 

198

They're just political hooligans, big hooligans. 

199

Mr. Huang!

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
These statements have not been confirmed. 

201
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,120
As a professor at Peking University,

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
how can you be so gullible as to believe in rumors without proof

203
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,280
and use them to confuse students?

204
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,720
One cannot teach a child. 

205
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000

Mr. Huang!

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,600
Guo Xingang, what are you doing? 

209
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,240
Get out of the way.

210
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,360
Are you going to silence our voices?

211
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
Your family owns Peking University!

212
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,080
What makes you think you can stop people from speaking? 

213
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,280
Shouldn't this be stopped? 

214
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,240
This is nonsense!

215
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,748
It's defamation! It's slander!

216
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,160
Exactly!

Did you post it? Tell me!

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,880
Don't lie!

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
Do you have any proof?

Are you Chen Duxiu's running dog?

How much does Chen Duxiu pay you

223
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,280
to protect him like this? 

224
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,080
Ridiculous!

What are you talking about? 

226

You're the running dog for the traditionalists!

[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

The first is to inform about

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
the distribution of "New Youth".

238
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
The second is to study the next issue.

Greetings, uncles.

Although there are noodles today,

245
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
it is also a work meeting, not a family meeting.

246
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,560
Change the word.

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
Greetings, editors.

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
I am entrusted by Manager Wang Mengzou

249
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,120
to report to you on the distribution

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,920

and then printed 3,000 copies,

254
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,680
all of which have been sold out.

22 cents per copy has been reduced to 20 cents per copy

The market has now risen to 6 yuan per book. 

275
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,520
This shows that "New Youth" has become

276
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,120
a famous magazine with collection status.

will expand the scope of your distribution,

284
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,200

Alright.

293

Then the second point of advice is,

294
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,480
I suggest

295
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,160
that I hope is that when you publish,

296
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,080
you can collect some

297

298

on this New Culture Movement.

328
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,520
Please talk about it first.

On the whole, the response of our New Culture lecture series

330
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
is quite enthusiastic. 

331
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,920
What's more is that

332
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
people with little education

333
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,240
have a lot of support for us.

334
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
This shows that our New Culture

335
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,080
has begun to popularize. 

336
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
What about negative feedback?

337
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,840
It mainly focuses

338
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,560
on whether words should be removed or not.

has reached 80%.

343
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,240
Do you think this view is common? 

344
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
Extremely undesirable. 

345
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,240
It seems that

346
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,240
we really need to reflect on this problem. 

347
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
The fact that even Zhang Shizhao and Yan Fu are criticizing your proposals

348
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,800
makes this a little serious.

349
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,000
Now I'm

350
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,560
this street mouse that everyone shouts and fights.

351
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,080
It stinks. 

352
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,280
I think this question

353
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,120
should not be mentioned in public in the future.

354
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,000
Think about it carefully. 

355
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,520
It's really too extreme

356
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
to abolish words. 

357
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,560
I agree.

358
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720

359
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,320
the next issue of "New Youth".

It's your turn.

362
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,520
I... I'm not ready yet.

363
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
Why are you not ready? 

364
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,160
I...

365
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
No, how can you become

366
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,680
dejected and despondent after a little setback? 

367
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Don't think of yourself as a street mouse.

368
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
Didn't I just say that?

369
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,880
In the process of exploration,

370
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
we do have some immature points,

371
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,520
but we will correct them step by step. 

372
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,840
In this way, we can stride forward. 

373
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
You're the managing editor. Speak.

374
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,760
Just do it.

375
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,440
OK, I'll just say it.

376
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,400
Recently, our editorial department

377
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,920
can receive more than a dozen letters

378
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,280
scolding "New Youth" every day,

379
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
and criticizing you Zhongfu by name. 

380
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
I studied these letters with Bannong. 

381
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,720
Ah, I found out that somebody paid someone

382
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,480
to write it. Quite unreasonable.

383
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,280
They don't only say that the Emperor is good

384
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,960
or that Chen Duxiu is a rogue who harms the country 

385
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,800
and reflects the people. 

386
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,360
I ask everyone to analyze it. 

387
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
What's going on? 

388
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,200
Not only letters but also leaflets. 

389
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,120
I heard this Guo Xingang say

390
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,040
that there is a student named Zhang Fengzai at Peking University

391
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,440
who paid someone to post leaflets.

392
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,520
The content of leaflets is attacking you. 

393
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,200
People in the newspaper

394
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,280
told me that there was a legislator named Zhang Changli. 

395
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,440
who hired people to write articles

396
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
to scold Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei. 

397
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
Zhang Changli...

398
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
I know that Zhang Fengzai you mentioned.

399
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,640
They are all extremely stubborn traditionalists.

400
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,000
I think

401
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
the traditionalist movement has changed. 

402
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,960
In the past, it was mainly aimed at Shizhi.

403
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,560
Now it has turned around

404
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
and is aimed at Zhongfu and Mr. Cai. 

405
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,680
It is very likely that there is a big plan behind this. 

406
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,320
What are you going to say? 

407
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,840
Fight back!

408
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,680
The theme of the next issue of "New Youth"

409
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,720
is to fight back!

410
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,160
I now call for contributions from all of you. 

411
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,320
Yucai, write another novel. 

412
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,840
It's being written. 

413
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,240
But I can't catch up with the next issue. 

414
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
Brother Shouchang, you are a fighter. 

415
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,760
What do you have? 

416
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,880
I'll write an article. 

417
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,160
Shizhi, what about you?

418
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,600
How about I dedicate two vernacular poems? 

419
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,840
That vernacular poem of yours is boring. 

420
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,880
What's not boring? 

421
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,360
Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies articles should work. You can write a couple. 

422
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,520
What do you mean? 

423
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,560
I meant what I said. 

424
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,160
Our "New Youth" is

425
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
a magazine of ideological enlightenment,

426
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,520
not a street newspaper that curses and fights.

427
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,040
Then why can't the "New Youth" magazine

428
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
borrow the form of running a newspaper?

429
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,400
Shizhi, I think you're just

430
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,840
sitting around watching the sky. 

431
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,560
All right, all right, all right.

432
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
You two rabbits, don't point at each other the moment you meet. 

433
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
Deqian has been busy with the Ministry of Education recently

434
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,160
with the standardization of punctuation marks. 

435
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,120
Bannong, you're the editor of the next issue.

436
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
You come to assist Deqian. 

437
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
Bannong, let's have a good chat after the meeting.

438
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,520
Hand me a head of garlic. 

439
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,160
Bannong.

440
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,800
Think. How are we going to fight this battle? 

441
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
I, Liu Bannong, in the eyes of his Hu Shizhi,

442
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,120
am just a Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies reporter

443
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,960
who only attended middle school.

444
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,400
Where is there any good idea? 

445
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
You can come up with a good idea

446
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,640
because you are a Mandarin Duck and Butterflies reporter. 

447
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,840
How about we make a duet play this time? 

448
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,600
What do you mean a duet?

449
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,040
I ask you,

450
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,960
Who is the standard-bearer of Beijing against New Culture

451
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,880
and against "New Youth" now? 

452
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,080
Standard-bearer?

453
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:50,800
Slow down! Be careful!

454
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,760
Of course. 

455
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,440
Of course, it's Lin Shu's

456
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,360
gang of traditionalists.

457
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,760
Let's take Lin Shu as the prototype. 

458
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,760
Concentrate all the infiltration theories of the traditionalists

459
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,760
attacking New Culture

460
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
represented by him

461
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
into a reader's letter.

462
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,360
Then,

463
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
let's send him a long article 

464
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,400
in the name of a "New Youth" reporter.

465
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
Refute this letter from readers one by one. 

466
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,600
This question-and-answer form is novel and lively. 

467
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
This will certainly arouse

468
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,400
readers' curiosity and interest. 

469
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,760
If there is no accident,

470
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
it may even lead to a big argument. 

471
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Liu Bannong, I think you should change your name. 

472
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,640
To "Liu Banxian" (literally, demi-god) 

473
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
Do you really think this duet can be performed? 

474
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,320
I can do it. I can do it. 

475
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,280
Let's just do it. 

476
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,560
I'll write the reader's letter. 

477
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,840
How about you write rebuttal article? 

478
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,800
OK.

479
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,400
I think this topic

480
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,200
should be called "A Letter to New Youth Editors".

481
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,320
How about that?

482
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
I can see how that can work,

483
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,760
but the reader's letter

484
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,880
has to have a signature. 

485
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,760
Signature?

486
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,360
How about Wang Jingxuan? 

487
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,560
Call it anything. 

488
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,680
Then my article is called

489
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,800
"Reply to Wang Jingxuan's Letter".

490
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Since this Wang Jingxuan is a traditionalist,

491
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,800
I don't need punctuation marks in my letter. 

492
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,080
In this paper, I will put forward

493
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,760
a total of eight infiltration theories against New Culture. 

494
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,800
How about that?

495
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,680
Eight is good.

496
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,560
Eight is pretty good.

497
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,240
You accuse a few and I'll refute a few.

498
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,720
Then I'll make sure that you, Wang Jingxuan,

499
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,680
are torn to pieces. 

500
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,960
Deqian, you compiled this issue very well. 

501
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,800
Wang Jingxuan's reader's letter

502
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,000
put forward the main arguments of the opposition's

503
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,560
attack on our New Culture Movement.

504
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,080
In addition, the reporter's reply of this magazine

505
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
also made our views on these basic issues

506
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,040
all clear.

507
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,000
This form is very good. 

508
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
You have created a new genre. 

509
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Besides, Deqian, you are very talented. 

510
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,080
You were depressed in the last issue,

511
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,600
but this issue turned over. Look. 

512
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,680
Brother Zhongfu, are you making fun of me? 

513
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
I don't dare claim someone else's work.

514
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,440
This is Bannong's idea.

515
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,400
I made up this letter by Wang Jingxuan,

516
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,320
but the reporter's reply was written by Bannong. 

517
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,680
If you're asking you contributed the most,

518
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,440
then it's Bannong.

519
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,040
I didn't say it was all yours. 

520
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,400
You...

521
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,760
I have a different view. 

522
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
Our "New Youth" is an academic journal,

523
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,120
a magazine of ideological enlightenment. 

524
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,960
Academics is the primary way

525
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
by running a tabloid newspaper

526
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,680
like "New Youth".

527
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,240
Talking about New Culture in this low tone. 

528
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,600
I think it's simply self-destruction. 

529
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
Hu Shizhi, make yourself clear. 

530
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,360
Why do I have low tone?

531
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Well first, you didn't ask my permission

532
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
to write the attack on me. 

533
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,600
That's an infringement of my human rights.

534
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,520
Shizhi, I used

535
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,080
all the statements that openly attacked you in the newspaper. 

536
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,800
Bannong quoted your rebuttal,

537
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,720
which was also published publicly. 

538
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,560
How can this be called a personal attack? 

539
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,360
Isn't that too harsh? 

540
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
What do you think it should be like? 

541
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,240
Shizhi, you're exaggerating.

542
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
I think this way of asking and answering questions is very good. 

543
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,360
Exactly.

544
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,280
Lively, interesting, and worth reading.

545
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,640
New Culture and new inventions

546
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,240
needs new means to express it. 

547
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,200
I mean,

548
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
we are a serious academic journal. 

549
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
and we can't engage in these petty things

550
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
just to attract attention.

551
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,920
Brother Zhongfu.

552
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,040
Apologizes, apologizes.

553
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,600
Sir.

554
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,320
Apologizes.

555
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,040
Mr. Cai.

556
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,520
Mr. Cai.

557
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,800
Thank you for waiting. 

558
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,640
Brother Zhongfu.

559
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,520
This issue of "New Youth" magazine

560
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
is well run. 

561
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,960
In particular, this "Reply to Wang Jingxuan's Letter"

562
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,120
is very well written. 

563
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,600
A Wang Jingxuan vividly written

564
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:20,191
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

565
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,560
as the spokesman of the traditionalists.

566
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,560
Look at this. Excellent! 

567
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,160
Very good.

568
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
I think it's good, too. 

569
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,880
Shizhi.

570
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:31,840
Sir.

571
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,560
What's the matter?

572
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,680
Nothing.

573
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,200
Shizhi has a toothache these two days. 

574
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,880
Toothache?

575
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,800
It is easy to get angry when the weather is hot. 

576
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,800
You need to see a doctor. 

577
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,680
A toothache is not a disease but a pain that kills.

578
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,040
You have to cure it. 

579
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
Yeah, you have to cure it.

580
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
Yeah, cure it.

581
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
The novels translated by Mr. Lin

582
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
still have no literary meaning at all. 

583
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,360
Why? 

584
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,600
Because the manuscripts he translated,

585
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,160
first of all, were not carefully selected,

586
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,560
as he often translated foreign works

587
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,680
of little value,

588
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,160
while the works of great value were untouched. 

589
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,200
Second, there are too many errors in translation,

590
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,200
which completely loses the spirit

591
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,560
of the original 

592
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,040
in the translated version. 

593
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,680
Got it.

594
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,160
Stop reading. 

595
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,920
What Wang Jingxuan? 

596
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,760
It's obvious that they're talking about me, Lin Shu.

597
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,720
I want to fight back. 

598
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,120
I will never spit on my own face.

599
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,320
The point of view is clear.

600
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,600
Got it. Got it.

601
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,880
You're not reading it clearly.

602
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,960
It's advocating old literature. 

603
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,200
Is it? Right.

604
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
Good evening, students. 

605
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,560
Mr. Shouchang.

606
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,200
Hello, sir.

607
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,000
Hello, sir.

608
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,280
Please sit down, everyone.

609
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,360
Tonight,

610
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,280
the topic of our reading club is

611
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,760
"New Youth", Volume IV, No.3

612
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,360
"Reply to Wang Jingxuan's Letter".

613
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,880
What about this issue? 

614
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
Fu Sinian was particularly interested,

615
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
so he volunteered to attend. 

616
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,760
Everyone welcome him.

617
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,600
Aren't you Mr. Huang Kan's student, Fu Sinian? 

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
How did you swtich sides? 

619
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
What do you mean, switch sides?

620
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,720
I just came to listen. 

621
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,240
Introduce this paragraph to everyone. 

622
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,000
Move over.

623
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,440
Okay, next, please welcome Zhao Shiyan. 

624
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,400
Let's analyze this work. 

625
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,320
This work is mainly composed of

626
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,080
two articles, one with questions and one with answers.

627
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,200
As far as I know, 

628
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
the letter asking questions was written by Professor Qian Xuantong. 

629
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
In the name of reader Wang Jingxuan,

630
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,920
he stood on the position of traditionalism,

631
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,440
and put forward eight questions

632
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,480
to the editorial department of "New Youth"

633
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,440
in fierce language

634
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
and attacked the New Culture Movement.

635
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,320
Professor Liu Bannong,

636
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,095
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

637
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,320
as an editor of "New Youth" magazine

638
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
wrote "Reply to Wang Jingxuan's Letter"

639
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,080
which refuted Wang Jingxuan's views 

640
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,240
one by one and comprehensively

641
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,480
and systematically stated

642
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,840
the position of New Culture. 

643
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,880
These two works

644
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,960
can be said to be a big debate between the old and new forces

645
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,040
in the field of ideology and culture. 

646
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,720
The essence of the debate

647
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
is whether Chinese culture should remain traditional or innovate. 

648
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,720
That's all I want to introduce.

649
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,840
Let's discuss it. 

650
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,960
I think all the students in our reading class

651
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:25,172
[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

652
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,040
have the same basic views 

653
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,480
on the New Culture Movement. 

654
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,240
What about the contents of these two letters? 

655
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
We usually pay attention to it, discuss it,

656
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
and distinguish right from wrong. 

657
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,840
So I think what we should do

658
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
is not to sit here and talk about it,

659
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,240
but to go out and publicize

660
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
to inspire more people's thoughts. 

661
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,440
Zhongxie.

662
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
You said your classmates all agree on the point of view. 

663
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
I don't think so. 

664
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,040
If you don't believe me, ask the one next to me first.

665
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,800
Mr. Huang Kan's disciple,

666
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
President of our Peking University Student Union,

667
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
student Fu Sinian.

668
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,320
Guo Xingang, don't provoke me. 

669
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,920
I respect Mr. Huang Kan's knowledge,

670
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,720
but I love my teacher and I love the truth more. 

671
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm here today

672
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,840
to see what our student union

673
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
can do for New Culture. 

674
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,840
If you say so,

675
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
you can help the New Culture Movement do something. 

676
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,960
I still support you very much. 

677
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,480
That's of course. 

678
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
I think brother Zhongxie is quite right. 

679
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,480
Publicity and popularization

680
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,840
of New Culture knowledge and enlightenment thought

681
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,520
to the masses is a top priority. 

682
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,000
Our reading class should do more

683
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
in this respect. 

684
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,480
Isn't this "Reply to Wang Jingxuan's Letter"

685
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,520
a duet play? 

686
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,680
How about we show it? 

687
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,960
That's a good idea. 

688
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,840
That's a good idea. 

689
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,120
A duet is a two-person play. 

690
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,280
"Reply to Wang Jingxuan's Letter" is a question-and-answer form. 

691
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,280
It should be a live newspaper play. 

692
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,280
No matter whether it's a duet or a live newspaper drama,

693
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,440
it's very lively. 

694
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,640
All forms are

695
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,760
supported by our student union. 

696
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,760
We will provide clothing and venues. 

697
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,440
This is not bad!

698
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,600
Students, what about this.

699
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,560
Let's rehearse this newspaper play

700
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
in the name of the reading class,

701
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,800
but don't say anything about it

702
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
until it is rehearsed. 

703
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,120
Zhongxie, Shiyan.

704
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
You two have been in a live newspaper drama,

705
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,280
then one of you should be the director, and the other the screenwriter

706
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
and actors should be decided by the director.

707
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
How about everyone participate? 

708
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,600
Yes!

709
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,400
Yes!

710
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,240
Where are we going to play this newspaper play

711
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,960
after rehearsal? 

712
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,960
Go to the overpass. There are so many people there. 

713
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,680
So you rehearse it first. 

714
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,880
When the time comes,

715
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,080
I'll invite the editorial board of "New Youth"

716
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,120
to watch the first show.

717
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,960
We'll discuss where to play. 

718
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,600
Is it all right?

719
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,480
Alright!

720
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,440
Let's do it!

721
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,240
Good!

722
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,080
Brother Haiwei, give it to me.

723
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:39,990
[Beijing French Language Center]

724
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,040
Give it to me. Let me try it. 

725
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,400
Lower!

726
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,360
Quick! Quick!

727
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,680
Come on, everybody, put your work aside. 

728
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,000
We have good news to announce to you. 

729
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,240
Come on, gather around. 

730
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,560
According to Mr. Shouchang's arrangement,

731
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
my classmates Zhao Shiyan and I are responsible

732
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,280
for the rehearsal and performance of this newspaper play. 

733
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,560
We have decided how to divide the work.

734
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,160
I am in charge of adapting the script

735
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
and Shiyan is in charge of directing. 

736
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,320
Is everyone not welcoming it? 

737
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,200
Welcome!

738
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,440
Thank you everyone. Thank you everyone.

739
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,160
Let me make two explanations on the script first. 

740
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,800
First,

741
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,680
The script was adapted from "Reply to Wang Jingxuan's Letter"

742
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,800
and now the title of the play is tentatively named "Bells in the Red Chamber".

743
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,280
Second, there are two characters in the play.

744
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,120
One is that the character of Wang Jingxuan

745
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
is inspired from the

746
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,440
great translator Lin Shu. 

747
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,960
I discussed it with the director

748
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,880
and decided to use Professor Gu Hongming. 

749
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,120
Another role 

750
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,080
is that the "New Youth" reporter

751
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,160
is Dean Chen Duxiu.

752
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,680
We decided to use Professor Hu Shi

753
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,360
as the prototype of this character.

754
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Now, please ask Director Shiyan

755
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,360
to give a brief account of the director. 

756
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
Give him a welcome.

757
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,760
Welcome!

758
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Thank you everyone.

759
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,040
Let me focus on how to split the work. 

760
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,280
There are AB casts, altogether four actors.

761
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,680
Reporter in Cast A: Chen Yannian 

762
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,520
Reporter in Cast B: Deng Zhongxia

763
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,160
The actor of Wang Jingxuan 

764
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,080
Cast A: Liu Mei 

765
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,440
Cast B: Guo Xingang 

766
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,600
Don't laugh. 

767
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Who do you want me to play? 

768
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,240
Liu Mei playing Wang Jingxuan 

769
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,360
Woman disguised as a man. 

770
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,080
Exactly.

771
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,880
These two Cast A actors

772
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,640
have been carefully studied by us. 

773
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,160
It was just decided. 

774
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,520
How did you work it out? 

775
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,800
I think there is a deep meaning

776
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,240
in letting you play this role. 

777
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,600
What does that mean? 

778
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,240
Making me play an old man. I won't do it. 

779
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,560
Think about it. 

780
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,480
Since ancient times,

781
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
whether it is acting or watching a play,

782
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
all of them were men,

783
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,440
while women were always excluded

784
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,040
from the main trend. 

785
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,440
What our new culture movement advocates

786
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
is democracy and freedom, 

787
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,120
which is the awakening of all people. 

788
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,040
This is not just about men. 

789
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,520
but also the millions upon millions of women.

790
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,120
So you playing this role,

791
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,640
is a great irony to people

792
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,320
like Wang Jingxuan. 

793
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,600
Makes sense.

794
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,320
Well said!

795
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,240
Great!

796
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,560
I understand.

797
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,640
I will definitely try my best to play this Wang Jingxuan. 

798
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,280
Geat!

799
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,720
There is no objection to the arrangement of the actors.

800
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,600
Let's talk about the next item. 

801
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,360
Clothing is very important 

802
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,720
Fu Sinian is in charge. 

803
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,760
Got it, got it.

804
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Refer to Gu Hongming to get Wang Jingxuan's clothes.

805
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,920
For the reporter's clothes, refer to Hu Shi. 

806
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,360
For the reporter's clothes,

807
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,440
we can borrow them directly from Professor Hu Shi.

808
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,600
What about this Wang Jingxuan's costume? 

809
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
You can't borrow it from Mr. Gu Hongming. 

810
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,080
You can't just wear Old Man Gu's clothes

811
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,520
if you borrow them, can you? 

812
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,320
I'll take care of it. 

813
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,680
I'll rent it at the costume shop. 

814
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,160
Alright.

815
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,640
Alright.

816
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,960
Props: Luo Zhanglong, Liu Haiwei.

817
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,720
Advertising: Luo Jialun, Bai Lan.

818
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,240
Logging: Deng Zhongxia.

819
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,400
Announcer: Bai Lan, Luo Jialun.

820
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,600
And me?

821
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,040
I'll give you something to do.

822
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,320
Be a good audience.

823
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,920
So Director Shiyan's announcement is finished. 

824
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,800
Do you have any other comments?

825
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,840
None!

826
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,720
Liu Mei?

827
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,840
I also have nothing to say.

828
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,680
All right, do your job and get to work. 

829
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,800
Alright!

830
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,920
Alright!

831
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,120


832
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,240


833
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,600


834
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,640


835
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,280


836
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,400


837
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,560


838
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,120


839
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,480


840
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:50,880


841
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,520


842
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,320


843
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,520


844
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400


845
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,640


846
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,080


847
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,120


848
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400


849
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,880


850
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,040


851
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120


852
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,360


853
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,040


854
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,360


855
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,640


856
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,560


857
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,240


858
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,640


859
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,280


860
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,080


861
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,440


862
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,680


863
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,440


864
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,880


865
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,600


866
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,200


867
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,880


868
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,480


869
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,000


870
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,800


871
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,440


872
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,800


873
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,800


874
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,360


875
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,920


876
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,480


877
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,600


878
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,560


879
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,840


880
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,160


881
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,200


882
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,040


883
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,400


884
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,560


885
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,920


886
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,440


887
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,040


888
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,760


889
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,720


890
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,880


891
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,280


892
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,560


893
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,440


894
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,480


895
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,360


896
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,280


897
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,400


898
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,200


899
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,080


900
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,320


901
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,440


902
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,640


903
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,240


904
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,840


905
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,440


906
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,360


907
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,960


908
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,640


909
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440


910
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,400


911
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,920


912
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,440


913
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,480


914
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,160


915
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,160


916
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,000


917
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,640


918
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,760


919
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,800


920
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,600


921
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,880


922
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,760


923
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,920


924
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,880


925
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,080


926
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240


927
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,680


928
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,040


929
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,120


930
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,000


931
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,520


932
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,040


933
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,120


934
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,560


935
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,320


936
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,400


937
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,600


938
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,200


939
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,520


940
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,440


941
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,320


942
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,360


943
