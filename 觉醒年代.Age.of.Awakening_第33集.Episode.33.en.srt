00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,118
[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:05,118 --> 00:00:08,108
[Episode Thirty-three]

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,040
I propose

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,080
The meeting broke up after a while.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,080
Take each branch factory as a unit.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
Everyone is going to take to the streets to support students.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
And go to the presidential palace to petition, okay?

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,400
good

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
good

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,200
middle

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,920
The physical condition of the arrested students

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,200
And mental condition?

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Most of the students' mood is relatively stable.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,120
Have done a comprehensive and reactionary government.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,400
Long-term preparation for Zhou Xuan

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,640
Just because the police arrested him violently. 

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,400
Many students were injured.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,720
Plus no food, no water.

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,080
And no medicine.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,680
So many people are sick.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,960
This is a hurdle.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm going to check on them later.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Sir, you can't go

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,600
We've found out before.

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,200
The police informant gave you to the town.

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,040
It's too dangerous for you to come forward now

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,840
be

28
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,760
Liu Yipin followed me when I came. 

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,960
It's too dangerous for you to go.

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm fine

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,480
Just take care of Mr. Zhongfu.

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,840
You are equally important to us.

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,680
None of you can do without the student movement. 

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,520
I won't let you go

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,760
That way.

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,480
That's all I have on me. Take it.

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,880
Shiyan goes back at night

38
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
You come with me to get some money

39
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
Take this money to the students.

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,600
Buy some medicine and food.

41
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,280
Take care of them.

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,160
good

43
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,360
At the same time, I also hope that everyone

44
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Can mobilize the surrounding forces.

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,120
Money, money, strong efforts.

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,120
Will you help the students through this difficulty?

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,720
good

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,520
good

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:01:59,840


50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
The vast number of workers and friends

51
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
This is the most dangerous moment right now.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,680
Who gritted his teeth until the end? 

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,840
Who can win the final victory?

54
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,280
Everyone heard it just now.

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,200
We arrested more than 1000 students.

56
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,880
heavy loss

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
But just because

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,680
More than 1000 students were arrested.

59
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,560
Let all the Chinese people see it. 

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Reactions of Beiyang government

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
At the critical moment when the country was betrayed

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
These students stepped forward.

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
At the expense of personal interests and future.

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
Weigh with the blood of youth. 

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,960
Shake with the heat of youth.

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,240
The traitorous behavior and reactionary nature of the government

67
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
And with their patriotic feats. 

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,440
Awaken all the people.

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,640
I firmly believe that as long as we hold on a little longer 

70
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,960
The situation will definitely change.

71
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,440
Of course, in the process 

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
Everyone should also take care of themselves.

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,560
You can't be rash or make unnecessary sacrifices.

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
Beware of reactionaries jumping into a wall. 

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,360
Although it is such a dark time.

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
I still believe

77
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,000
As long as we unite and work hard

78
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,680
The final victory must belong to us. 

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Unite to win.

80
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Unite to win.

81
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,440
Director Wu

82
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
All the students arrested yesterday were put in the temple of horses. 

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
But now the temple of horses along the North River 

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
Are surrounded by ordinary people.

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
You can't stop anyone who asks for food.

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,320
this is great

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,760
People have helped us a lot. 

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
The students have food.

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,800
Notify Duan Zhigui

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
Put the north river along the horse temple

91
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
Open all doors, big and small.

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
Allow ordinary people to deliver food. 

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,440
Jiaozi steamed bun noodles can do anything.

94
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
You can also send clothes

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,440
Not Director Wu.

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
That's not a free market.

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Shut up and go for it.

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,080


99
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,480
Shut up and go for it.

100
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,360
be

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,600
Old guys, are you standing still?

102
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:47,680


103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,800
Old guys, what are you staring at? 

104
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,000
Come to a meeting.

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
Yi qunxian

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,640
He Mengxiong

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,080
Yi qunxian

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,520
Kuaiqiu

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:01,760


110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
He Mengxiong

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:03,920
Mrs. Chen

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000


113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,080


114
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,640
Mrs. Chen

115
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,280
Eat while it's hot

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,520
There you are.

117
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,880
You can come.

118
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,000
Locked up here.

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
I've been worried sick. I haven't heard from you.

120
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,440
Are you all right?

121
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,400
never mind

122
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,520
Are you hungry?

123
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
famished

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,160
Come on, come on.

125
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,840
Come and eat steamed stuffed bun, students.

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,480
come

127
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,160
very delicious

128
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
Qun lai xian he Zhou

129
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,640
There's food, there's food.

130
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Delicious!

131
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,160
Liu Mei

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,200
There's food here.

133
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
Give it to the students.

134
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,280
Divide it over.

135
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,960
This classroom

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,480
It's the classroom that I attended before.

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
I'll just take this place as a classroom.

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,760
so much/many

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,320
Take them all.

140
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,280
Read more books.

141
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,320
I have an envelope here.

142
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,280
I come

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,560
Let's divide it.

144
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,280
Before I came in, I wanted to borrow books.

145
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,480
There are two books on this list.

146
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,680
Go and borrow it for me.

147
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,280
No problem. I'll borrow it for you later.

148
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,240
Thank you

149
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,600
Qunxian

150
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,760
They won't bully you again, will they?

151
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,320
brave

152
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,880
brave

153
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
Who dares to bully her

154
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,320
If anyone bullies me

155
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,640
I bite him.

156
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Mrs. Chen

157
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,360
Your steamed stuffed bun is really delicious.

158
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,880
If I could eat it every day 

159
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,840
Such a delicious steamed bun

160
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm even worth going to jail.

161
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,000
Silly child

162
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Want to eat my bag for you every day 

163
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
Thank you, Jenny.

164
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,240
Eat more, class.

165
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
Eat more, and you can pack it after eating.

166
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Thank you, Jenny.

167
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,280
It's delicious, Jenny

168
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
Yannian Qiaonian

169
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Keep your voice down. He's not awake yet.

170
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,800
Sir is still asleep.

171
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,280
right

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,920
good

173
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,120
wife of one's teacher/master

174
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,800
十堰好

175
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
Get me something to eat. I'm starving. I'm starving.

176
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,680
Get him two bags.

177
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:08,960
hurry up

178
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
You know you came to see me.

179
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
Look at you. I'm starving.

180
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
Come and eat.

181
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
My family is doing it now. 

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,400
Don't know anything.

183
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,440
Tell me about it quickly

184
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,160
What's going on outside? 

185
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm telling you, I'm always here.

186
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
Look, Mr. Shouchang can't go shopping.

187
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
My news is full of

188
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,640
My classmates who came back passed it on to me. 

189
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,600
Then stay in the red chamber.

190
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
You're better informed than I am. 

191
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,320
Don't worry, eat slowly. 

192
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
Let me tell you two pieces of bad news first. 

193
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,440
First, I this morning

194
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,360
Tens of thousands of students in Beijing took to the streets to petition.

195
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
Fight against the military police

196
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,480
Many students were injured.

197
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Hawick Lau; Lau Hoi Wai

198
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,160
Liu Haiwei was also injured.

199
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,960
Luo Zhanglong

200
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,000
Which hospital?

201
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
It is said that there is no serious problem.

202
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
But others saw him.

203
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,360
It came when my head was bandaged.

204
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
Decorate them with steamed stuffed buns.

205
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
It's estimated that when Shiyan leaves later.

206
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,320
Second, Beijing has now officially ordered

207
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,440
Change the president of Peking University

208
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Cai Yuanpei was replaced by Hu Renyuan

209
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
Forget it. Forget it. 

210
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
There's still some good news.

211
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,280
this morning

212
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,120
Military police only beat people, not arrest people.

213
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,520
Why?

214
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,280
Because there is no place to hold students.

215
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
This shows that the reactionaries are afraid.

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
Second, today is not just a student.

217
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,600
Workers, businessmen and citizens

218
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
Petition on the streets.

219
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,960
The third point is the most important

220
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
Electricity was sent from Shanghai.

221
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
The five major yarn mills of commercial press 

222
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
All dock workers of Zhonghua Bookstore went on strike.

223
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
All major shops in Nanjing Road went on strike.

224
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
Even in front of the barber shop.

225
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
State affairs are so unintentional.

226
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
Please don't patronize the slogan.

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
Do you know what this is called?

228
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,360
It's called three strikes.

229
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,400
Students strike, workers strike, businessmen strike.

230
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,520
Mr. Dazhao said

231
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,800
As long as three strikes are formed.

232
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,760
The nature of the student movement has changed. 

233
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
Everyone is on their feet.

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
All classes

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
All involved in patriotic action.

236
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,240
Victory also knows the source code

237
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,360
Great

238
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,120
But Mr. Dazhao said

239
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,840


240
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
So as not to get excited and do something drastic.

241
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,120
I'm almost excited.

242
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
You have locked me up. 

243
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm just like you.

244
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
Zhong solved the death order.

245
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,320
Let me keep an eye on Mr. Shouchang.

246
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,320
Don't say it's really dangerous.

247
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,440
I saw it the day before yesterday.

248
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,040
Liu Yipin is already at Mr. Shouchang's tip in CHO.

249
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,840
Liu yipin

250
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,240
right

251
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
He and Zhang Fengzai are the same people.

252
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
Now, the police department

253
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,280
It's already Mr. Shouchang on the town.

254
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,120
So Zhong Jie won't let me leave.

255
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,320
Mr. Shouchang, half step

256
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
Stop it, Deng Zhongxia. Now take my place.

257
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,280
Get some steamed buns out quickly. 

258
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,480
Mr. Shouchang hasn't eaten yet

259
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,080
Take some more.

260
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,960
Take them all.

261
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,440
good

262
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Jenny, I'm going first.

263
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:34,960
good

264
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
Be careful on the road. Okay

265
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,360
ok, thanks

266
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,480
Be careful!

267
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,360
good

268
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,680
sir

269
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,520
The present situation is generally like this. 

270
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,960
Many of our arrested students

271
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,200
Locked up in the Third College of Literature and Law of Peking University. 

272
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,640
Now the citizens are going straight.

273
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,080
Sent them water and food.

274
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,960
And changing clothes.

275
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,480
So I think

276
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
Their mood should be relatively stable.

277
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
But I don't think it will last long.

278
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,400
I will organize with some classmates.

279
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,120
visit their

280
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
Let them not worry.

281
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,960
good

282
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,240
classmates

283
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,520
Now the struggle has reached a white-hot stage.

284
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
The citizens have already got up. 

285
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
I believe we just have to grind our teeth for a few more days. 

286
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
The reactionaries will want to cooperate.

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,840
That turning point will appear.

288
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,480
but

289
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,240
The more at this time. 

290
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
The more we need to calm down.

291
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
In case the reactionaries jump the wall.

292
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,800
I see

293
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,600
Got it

294
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,160
good

295
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
What is the situation in the Third Hospital now?

296
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,880
The third hospital is in good condition.

297
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
But the second hospital is nervous.

298
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,280
That way.

299
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,320
Let some students

300
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,840
Go and touch the situation of the Second Hospital. 

301
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,280
At the same time, tell the students of the Second Hospital 

302
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
Don't be impulsive.

303
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,560
Be calm and avoid the military police.

304
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
At this time, in case of giving orders.

305
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,280
Got it.

306
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,920
wife of one's teacher/master

307
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,800
sir

308
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,840
Look who's here.

309
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,280
wife of one's teacher/master

310
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,520
Come in quickly.

311
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,280


312
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,240
It's raining again

313
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
As soon as the road was asked, it came. 

314
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,080


315
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,160


316
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,320
Look at the road and you're coming.

317
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:54,400


318
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,280
a little way off

319
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,320
good

320
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,720
Hello, Jenny.

321
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,760
Hello, classmates.

322
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,720
Sister!

323
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,280
Didn't we discuss it at home?

324
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,800
Let you stay at home.

325
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
It's so messy in the street outside now.

326
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,680
People are being arrested everywhere

327
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,960
You said you were calm.

328
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
What are you doing here?

329
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
I just heard that the school also arrested people.

330
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,360
I don't trust

331
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
Just came to see you.

332
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,960
I brought you some food.

333
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
And a change of clothes

334
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,560
You're still carrying something so heavy.

335
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
Sister!

336
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,520
Don't say anything when all your classmates are here.

337
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
Students haven't eaten yet, have they

338
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,440
I came to bake you sesame cakes.

339
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,400
And the fire.

340
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,440
It's still hot.

341
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,960
Come on, everybody, come and eat.

342
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,760
Thank you, madam. Thank you, madam.

343
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:35,840


344
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,800
Thank you, madam. Thank you, madam.

345
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
Take it, take it, take it, take it 

346
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,520
Let me help you.

347
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
Try it all.

348
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,600
delicious

349
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,160
delicious

350
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:42,800
Taste it.

351
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:42,880


352
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,120
Taste it.

353
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,360
Taste the words and taste them.

354
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,920
Taste it.

355
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,880
There's a fire here

356
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
Come and eat.

357
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Delicious. Take some more

358
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,400
Would you like some pickles?

359
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,280
need not

360
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
Then, sir, we'll go first.

361
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Be sure to be safe.

362
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,320
good

363
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,840
Students must pay attention to safety.

364
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,040
nicely

365
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,720
If anyone is hungry, take some more. 

366
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
Yeah, no, no.

367
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,800
go

368
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,400
Be sure to be safe.

369
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,280
nicely

370
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,080
We walked

371
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,720
good

372
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,680
Sister Tang

373
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:20,960


374
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,880
Pour me a bowl.

375
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm really hungry.

376
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,280
I just asked Shiyan to go to brother Zhongfu's house.

377
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,400
Get me something to eat.

378
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
He hasn't come back yet.

379
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
You really saved my life.

380
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
Give charcoal in the snow.

381
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,280
give

382
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,400
It's the first time I've walked into school.

383
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
The school is so beautiful.

384
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
I remember when you were little.

385
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
Carrying a schoolbag

386
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
Bouncing to school

387
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,280
I'll watch you at the gate of the courtyard.

388
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,960
See nothing.

389
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
I really admire you.

390
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
Mei you can go to school. 

391
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
I think the most beautiful voice in the world

392
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
It's the loud and bright sound of school reading.

393
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,800
I also walked into the school today.

394
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,520
Look at these children.

395
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,480
How energetic

396
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,800
elder sister

397
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,800
After dinner.

398
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
Let me show you around.

399
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,800
what's up

400
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,240
My stomach hurts.

401
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,280
no

402
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,160
No pain

403
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
Do you feel it?

404
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,000
He's kicking me

405
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,840
Kick me, too

406
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,920
What are you kicking us for?

407
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
You want to run out, too

408
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,760
I see

409
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,920
You also want to go to Peking University?

410
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Want dad to be your teacher?

411
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,000
yes or no 

412
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
Dad is very strict.

413
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,160
When the time comes, if you cry.

414
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
Don't blame dad.

415
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,840
elder sister

416
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,880
Sorry

417
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,280
Look, I brought you to Beijing.

418
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,440
I should have stayed with you.

419
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
As a result, I was too busy to go home. 

420
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
And in turn let you worry about me.

421
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,560
I'm sorry

422
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
I have hands and feet.

423
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,440
What do I want you to do with me? 

424
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,240
I am pregnant.

425
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,200
Not sick again.

426
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,200
I can manage myself.

427
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,320
Don't worry about it.

428
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
Look at yourself.

429
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,200
I haven't seen you for a few days

430
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,240
Just lost a lap.

431
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
I don't know you yet.

432
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,760
Get busy together

433
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,280
A cold bite and a hot bite.

434
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,960
Just messing around there.

435
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,480
We can't do this anymore.

436
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,920
I brought you a change of clothes. 

437
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,080
Are these two enough?

438
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,800
Enough is enough?

439
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm also taking two children.

440
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,880
Can't get away.

441
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,520
It's a pity that your wife will help me today.

442
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,280
Otherwise, I won't be able to visit you.

443
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
So, sister

444
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,120
Let's discuss it again.

445
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,080
I promise you.

446
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
From now on, I will have a good meal. 

447
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
But you have to promise me. 

448
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
You can't go out again. 

449
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,640
You said it was so messy outside now.

450
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm by your side.

451
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,280
I can't take care of you.

452
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
I already owe you a lot.

453
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,320
Han Tuo, you know what?

454
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,280
Baohua can be yours now.

455
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,200
I read there in the morning every morning. 

456
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,800
He can't recite poems. 

457
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't even eat.

458
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,840
It's like when you were little.

459
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,200
You were like this when you were a kid.

460
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,320
Can't recite the article 

461
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,160
You hide in that chicken coop and cry.

462
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm afraid to hear

463
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,360
With his mouth still humming and swallowing.

464
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,720
I'm telling you.

465
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,320
Where did you get a wild cat?

466
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:52,960
elder sister

467
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
You sleep at night

468
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,680
Still studying there. 

469
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,920
That candle burned your hair.

470
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,720
You don't even know

471
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,320
Almost burned down our house.

472
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,720
elder sister

473
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,680
You forgot all about it.

474
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
elder sister

475
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,040
I want to talk to you about my heart.

476
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,880
I think I've been Li Dazhao all my life.

477
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,080
I am worthy of the world.

478
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,080
I am worthy of my teacher. 

479
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
Be worthy of my friend.

480
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm worthy of my students.

481
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,040
But I'm sorry for you.

482
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,520
Ever since you followed me

483
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,200
Always worried about me.

484
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
Always worrying about me.

485
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
I feel sorry for you.

486
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Shouchang

487
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
You are a man of great importance.

488
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Every time you tell me the big things

489
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
I can understand some of them.

490
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
Some don't understand.

491
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:36,960
but

492
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,320
I don't care if I understand it or not. 

493
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,280
I knew it.

494
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,800
You are working for others.

495
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,320
Work for the common people

496
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,760
It's a good thing to do.

497
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,600
So I can't hold you back.

498
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
I will keep my home for you.

499
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,640
You can rest assured.

500
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,080
I think so.

501
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,520
I'll take the baby with me one of these days.

502
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,560
Dahuituo

503
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
Give birth there.

504
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,760
Don't distract you

505
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
So you don't have to worry about us.

506
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,000
it suddenly occurs to me that

507
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,720
It's this

508
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,080
Mr. Cai

509
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,680
From your new water

510
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,120
The deducted money

511
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
I've been saving it for you

512
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,040
I took out all my household items.

513
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,240
There are so many left.

514
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,400
I know you are useful.

515
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,440
Here you go.

516
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,960
Hantuo

517
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,240
You know my happiest thing.

518
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,040
What is it?

519
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,360
I'm happiest.

520
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,200
Copy that. You're from Tianjin

521
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,200
A letter sent to me from Japan

522
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,120
I'll just take those letters.

523
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,880
Just go to a door tree.

524
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
Let Mr. Big read it to me 

525
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160
After reading it.

526
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,080
I am under the kerosene lamp at night.

527
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,080
I just watch it over and over again.

528
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,160
I painted it with my hand.

529
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
Those words you wrote. 

530
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,480
I was just thinking.

531
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,880
I wish I could read.

532
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,320
If I can read

533
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,080
I can give it to my silly lump

534
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,920
Write a letter

535
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,440
I can talk to my idiot.

536
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,800
Tell me what's on my mind.

537
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,280
Don't look

538
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,960
Turn your face away.

539
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,440
What word?

540
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,960
plum

541
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,120
this

542
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:27,920
big

543
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,560
this

544
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:30,880


545
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,360


546
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,080
What about this?

547
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,040
I can't recognize this word.

548
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,880
elder sister

549
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,400
I promise you.

550
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,920
Wait till one day.

551
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,920
The school can put one.

552
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,040
When the desk is quiet 

553
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,720
When you can hear the sound of reading aloud.

554
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,480
I take you with me.

555
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,320
Just the two of us.

556
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
In a classroom.

557
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,240
Sunlight comes in from the outside.

558
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,880
I'll do it.

559
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,840
Yihua

560
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,440
at one stroke

561
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,520
Teach you to write by drawing.

562
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,680
Then I sat down at the bottom.

563
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,800
I'll be waiting for you.

564
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
What are you waiting for?

565
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
You write a letter to me yourself.

566
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
Where do I want to see? 

567
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,960
I promise you.

568
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,760
Eat quickly.

569
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,400
eat rice

570
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,360
eat rice

571
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,760
eat rice

572
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:51,680
[Zhao Renlan, wife of Li Dazhao, died 28 May 1933, aged 49. In June 1936, the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee posthumously recognized her as a member of the Communist Party of China.]

573
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,040
What are you going to do?

574
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,360
Go around

575
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,400
impossible

576
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,320
Zhongfu can't

577
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,440
I finished writing my manuscript.

578
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,880
I'll go out and have a look.

579
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
Didn't you promise Shouchang not to go out?

580
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,240
I finished writing my manuscript.

581
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm going out to have a look.

582
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,040
Yes, I konw.

583
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Whether Shouchang asked me to stay at home

584
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,480
Make up "New Youth"

585
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
Or Yannian doesn't go out and look at me.

586
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,640
impossible

587
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,280
It's all for my own safety. I know

588
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,600
I didn't want to cause you any trouble.

589
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Second, come on

590
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,560
I really want to calm down at home.

591
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,480
Write the manuscript of this issue well.

592
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
Sir, you can't go out. 

593
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,880
I need and I have to know.

594
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,600
Present

595
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,000
impossible

596
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,720
development of the situation

597
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,400
What I really want

598
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,920
Can you stop it?

599
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Hurry and steam steamed buns.

600
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,560
I have to send it to them.

601
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
Severely punish traitors

602
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,320


603
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,840
Severely punish traitors

604
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,320
Severely punish traitors

605
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

606
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
Severely punish traitors

607
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,240
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

608
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,840
Ah, come on, go 

609
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,880
Be honest.

610
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,880
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

611
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,320
Severely punish traitors

612
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,400


613
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,880
Severely punish traitors

614
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

615
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,840
Severely punish traitors

616
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,920
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

617
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
Severely punish traitors

618
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,560
Duihuajie Duihua

619
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,560
A pair went to Tian Xia.

620
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,520
Drop a seed and send a bud.

621
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,280
What flowers bloom in the leaves of the pole?

622
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,040
This country

623
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,880
I want to start a magazine.

624
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,680
As a way to awaken the political consciousness of Chinese people 

625
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,920
And the clarion call of ethical consciousness. 

626
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
I assure you.

627
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,920
Let me run a magazine for ten years 

628
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,200
The whole country's thoughts will change for it.

629
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,080
Guowei

630
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,240
National endangerment

631
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,080
But the authorities fought the rabbit with the lion's strength. 

632
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Play against our patriotism.

633
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
It makes me feel that in my own country.

634
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,480
Be bullied as much as Japan.

635
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,880
What hope is there for such a country

636
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,560
Two gentlemen

637
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
You have to save this country.

638
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
Save this nation.

639
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,800
A man like us

640
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,040
Most of them are farmers and illiterate countries. 

641
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
How can we make it work?

642
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,000
The Road of Intersecting Science with Democracy

643
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,760
What flowers bloom in the leaves of the pole?

644
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,280
There is no light in the liberal arts room.

645
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
Then where will he go? 

646
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:34,640
Take a look at the playground.

647
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,160
Take a look at the playground.

648
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,400
陈中富

649
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,160
Zhongfu

650
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,240
中富兄

651
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,720
中富兄

652
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,240
Are you there

653
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,440
not have

654
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,960
I said watch him, watch him.

655
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,840
With his character

656
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,040
Seeing such a situation now

657
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,560
Something will happen to him.

658
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,080
中富兄

659
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
陈中富

660
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,040
中富兄

661
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,600
Look for it 

662
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,720
Where to go, Shouchang

663
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,200
Looking for

664
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,240
Where are you going to look? 

665
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,080
We looked for the first hospital, the second hospital and the third hospital.

666
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,160
Mashenmiao north riverside honglou playground

667
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,960
He is not here.

668
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,640
Jun's sister-in-law is also looking for him.

669
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,680
Let's not worry now.

670
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,960
Let's think about where he will go.

671
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
All I can think about is home and school.

672
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,280
Bian Junman's sister-in-law is waiting for him at home. 

673
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,120
The two of us will wait here.

674
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,040
Shizhi asked you a question.

675
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,280
This is still us.

676
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,760
Is it worth fighting for?

677
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,360
Or these martyrs in Qiu Jin, Xu Xilin?

678
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,680
A Republic in exchange for blood? 

679
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,120
This classroom

680
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,560
We could have set a clean desk.

681
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,920
Let the students be quiet inside.

682
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,920
To enjoy the pleasure of knowledge.

683
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,400
But now it's a prison.

684
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,440
Look at my students inside.

685
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,960
Lock up your students.

686
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,560
Look at brother Guan Zhongfu's students

687
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,640
What's scary is the doorway.

688
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,480
There are still a group of parents in pain.

689
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
With their pleading eyes.

690
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
Seeking help from others.

691
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,480
Even kneeling down to the military police.

692
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,160
What's even more ridiculous is that

693
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
They are patriotic for their children.

694
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
And kneel down to the military police

695
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,280
What's wrong with this country

696
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Don't you think this country is ridiculous?

697
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,760
Shouchang, don't blame yourself

698
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,120
This is not your responsibility alone.

699
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,040
We really can't go on foolhardy.

700
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,680
Now each and every one of us

701
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,280
You have to think about it.

702
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,960
Review one's thinking

703
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Otherwise, only students will be humiliated.

704
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,520
Only the school was damaged.

705
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,560
It's like I was

706
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
It's the same as written in "Beijing Students' Disgraces" 

707
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,560
Shizhi, are we at fault?

708
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,760
Are students at fault?

709
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
You say such things at this time.

710
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
Aren't you opening your eyes for the reactionary government?

711
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,480
At this time

712
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,320
Don't put a hat on me, Shouchang

713
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,560
You mentioned your students just now.

714
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
Yes, we all saw it.

715
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,680
You feel bad and I feel bad.

716
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,760
But what can I do?

717
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
If we hadn't had a general strike.

718
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,880
If we adopt some mitigating measures

719
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,400
Our Peking University won't

720
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,840
Come to this point.

721
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,920
Shizhi, why do we want to strike?

722
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,600
Why are we striking?

723
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,600
It's not because the government wants to sign that.

724
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
The Paris Peace Treaty that humiliated the country?

725
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,480
We don't do it again and again.

726
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,400
To protest against the invalid appeal.

727
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
Do you have to do it?

728
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,840
Is patriotism guilty?

729
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,760
Traitorous deeds!

730
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,120
Patriotism has many ways.

731
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
There are many ways and means to save the country.

732
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,480
还有寿昌

733
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,520
I heard that you recently

734
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,120
Has been advocating the Russian revolution

735
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,000
Say we Chinese.

736
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,600
We must take the Russian road.

737
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,720
It's dangerous.

738
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
What's the danger?

739
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I advise you not to always dictate the American way.

740
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,960
Don't always believe in Dewey's experimentalism

741
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
You should be as compatible as Mr Cai said.

742
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,880
You have to have a look. 

743
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
The situation and changes after the Great War

744
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,600
You're going too far again.

745
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:37,680


746
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:37,840
You're going too far again.

747
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:37,920


748
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
We're talking about the present.

749
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,040
How do we save Peking University 

750
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,400
How do we save those of us

751
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,520
Arrested students

752
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,520
We have to do something. We have to do something.

753
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
It's no use worrying.

754
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,080
Let's be quiet, quiet can make us wise.

755
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
think of a way

756
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
My opinion is that we should cancel the strike.

757
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,640
We have to give the government a step down.

758
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,240
Never cancel the strike. 

759
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,120
The strike must not be cancelled at this time. 

760
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,800
We don't have a second way now.

761
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,840
There is only one way for us.

762
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,400
That is to adopt a more determined way.

763
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,200
Let's fight.

764
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,320
struggle

765
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,680
Do you still have to fight?

766
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,960
What's the use of struggle

767
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,520
Now you and Chen Zhongfu are covered in scars.

768
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Do you still have to fight and go to extremes?

769
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,040
Chen Zhongfu, he is the leader of our new culture.

770
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,920
Three of us.

771
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
Why can't we just do a new culture? 

772
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
Why are we going?

773
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,600
Wang is treading in this muddy water.

774
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,200
Go on like this.

775
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,680
Not only is Peking University finished.

776
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,680
And you two.

777
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
You two will ruin your academic career.

778
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,160
You will ruin your happy family.

779
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,360
Shizhi, ah

780
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's advocate the new culture movement.

781
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,920
Is to inspire people's wisdom.

782
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,800
So what happens when the people wake up?

783
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,440
There's bound to be some action.

784
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,520
All thoughts have no actions.

785
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,120
Can't save the country.

786
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,960
I'm not talking about us 

787
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,800
Don't act at all

788
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,840
I mean, you must stop going to extremes.

789
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,640
There should be an objective standard for not being extreme.

790
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,160
If a country's power trumps justice

791
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,080
If a country

792
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,360
Involving the core interests.

793
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
When the will of the people cannot be expressed.

794
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
So the citizens of this country

795
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,000
You can exercise your democratic rights.

796
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,840
Let's take Japan as an example

797
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,120
China was defeated in Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895

798
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
We cede land for compensation.

799
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
Even gave Taiwan Province to the Japanese.

800
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,160
We can't help it. We have no temper.

801
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,600
But now we are the victorious country, Shizhi.

802
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,520
Why does Germany take our Qingdao? 

803
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
Give it to Japan?

804
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,120
Is there any axiom in this?

805
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
If we let those traitors go.

806
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,040
If you trample on public opinion wantonly 

807
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,240
What about our country?

808
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,400
Can it still be called a democratic republic? 

809
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,720
Do we deserve to be called citizens of our country?

810
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
So for the national interest

811
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,680
Now we need a complete revolution.

812
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,560
Combine ideological awareness with action awareness.

813
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,040
I, Li Dazhao, would like to be this Depth Charge.

814
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,280
Nine without regret.

815
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,000
Although thousands of people have gone.

816
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,960
Zhongfu, where have you been?

817
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,480
I'm fine

818
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,560
I sat there for a while. 

819
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,640
My, uh.

820
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,640
I went for a spin.

821
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,600
寿昌说得对

822
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,320
Let me stay at home and not let me go. 

823
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,240
I'm going home.

824
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,640
It's over. I'm

825
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,480
I'm hungry.

826
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,400
I want to go home for dinner.

827
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
I'm thirsty, too.

828
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,800
it doesn't matter

829
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,320
I'm fine

830
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,480
Zhongfu

831
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,360
陈中富

832
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
The Republic is dead. 

833
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,560
I will not die

834
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,800
Mom!

835
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,080
When will dad come back?

836
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,280
I'm hungry

837
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,560
Wait a minute.

838
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
We didn't eat well until Dad came back.

839
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,120
Come back

840
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,480
Why don't you eat?

841
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,160
How can we eat if you don't come back? 

842
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,080
Yannian and Qiaonian didn't eat at noon.

843
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,280
Waiting for you.

844
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Come on, sit down

845
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,520
I made a hot pot

846
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,040
Improve for everyone.

847
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,480
Come sit down.

848
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Sit down, sit down.

849
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,560
Junman

850
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,200
I want to say sorry to you. 

851
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,720
because

852
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,320
I am not a qualified husband.

853
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,640
Yannian

854
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,720
Qiaonian

855
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,080
Henian

856
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,080
Zimei

857
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,320
And zilan.

858
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,640
还有白兰

859
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,760
There are Yuying and Songnian in their hometown.

860
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,640
I want to say sorry to you, too.

861
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,040
Because I am not a qualified father.

862
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,760
It is better to come back than anything else.

863
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,800
Don't say sorry.

864
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,280
Just hear me out. 

865
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,960
I stayed at home for three days.

866
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,520
I went out for a roll today.

867
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,240
As you can imagine.

868
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
What I see

869
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,120
I was a young man. 

870
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,920
A revolutionary who is determined to save the country. 

871
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
But I am not a good teacher.

872
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
Because I look at those students

873
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,440
Be trapped in the picture circle because of loving the country. 

874
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,840
So I have to take this step.

875
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,920
Your father

876
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,160
You have to kill yourself before you die.

877
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,280
Our children's family has just passed.

878
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,360
A few years of stability

879
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,040
But in the future

880
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,360
You may face different situations again.

881
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,040
Because I can't keep my eyes shut.

882
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,480
Watching my students bleed and cry. 

883
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,000
Be unmoved by

884
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,000
I have to fight with them.

885
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,760
Because I love this country.

886
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,120
This country is not only mine.

887
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,960
It's even yours.

888
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,920
I want to do something for this country.

889
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,680
from now on 

890
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,800
Maybe because of me.

891
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,680
You will also suffer.

892
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,960
Maybe because of me in the future 

893
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,760
You will also suffer hardships. 

894
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,600
so

895
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,120
I have to say sorry to you. 

896
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,360
This glass of wine is to make amends to you.

897
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,760
Are you okay?

898
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,120
Are you okay?

899
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Although I'm six, I can't drink. 

900
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
But today, I also want to propose a toast to apology.

901
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,880
Because I am also determined to devote myself to my country.

902
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,920
As the eldest son 

903
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
I may not be filial to my parents.

904
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
Can't do one's duty for younger brothers and sisters.

905
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,400
Today, I'll apologize with this glass of wine.

906
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,480


907
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:56,720
me too

908
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,520
me too

909
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,160
I'll drink this wine myself.

910
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,000
alright

911
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,360
Let's not say anything unlucky.

912
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Come on, everybody, sit down and eat.

913
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,040
we

914
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,640
Our family must live well.

915
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
Sit down, sit down.

916
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,560
dad

917
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,720
I'll fill it up for you

918
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,040
eat rice

919
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,720
eat rice
