[Episode Thirty-three]

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,040
I propose

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,080
that after the meeting is over,

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,080
we will organize each branch as a unit

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
to prepare to go to the streets in solidarity with the students

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
and go to the Presidential Palace to petition, okay?

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,400
Hurrah!

[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Most of the students are still in a stable condition.

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,120
They are ready for a full-scale long-term struggle

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,400
with the reactionary government.

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,640
Only because of violent police arrests

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,400
were many students were injured.

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,720
Plus there is no food, nor water,

nor medicine.

23
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,680
So many people are sick.

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,960
This is a hurdle.

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm going to check on them later.

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Sir, you can't go.

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,600
We've already found out

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,200
that police informants have you on their sights.

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,040
It's too dangerous for you to come forward now

30
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,840
Correct.

32

It's too dangerous for you to go.

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm fine.

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,480
Just take care of Mr. Zhongfu.

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,840
You are equally important to us.

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,680
None of you can do without the student movement.

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,520
I won't let you go.

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,760
How about this?

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,480
That's all I have with me. Take it.

40
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,880
Shiyan, go home tonight.

41
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
You come with me to get some money.

42
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
Use the money to buy medicine and food

43
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,600
for the students.

44
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,280
Take care of them.

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,160
Yes.

46
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,360
At the same time, I also hope that everyone

47
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
can mobilize the surrounding forces.

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,120
The wealthy contribute wealth, the powerful contribute power.

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,120
Will you help the students through these difficult times?

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,840
Yes!

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
Worker friends!

52
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
This is the most dangerous moment right now.

53
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,680
Who can grit their teeth until the end?

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,840
Who can win the final victory?

55
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,280
Everyone heard it just now.

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,200
More than a thousand of our students were arrested

57
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,880
and heavy losses were suffered.

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
But just because

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,680
more than a thousand students were arrested,

60
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,560
let all the Chinese people see

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
the reaction of the Beiyang government.

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
At the critical moment when the country was betrayed,

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
these students stepped forward.

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
At the expense of their personal interests and future,

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,960
with the blood of their youth,

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,240
they attacked the traitorous and reactionary nature of the government;

67
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
and with their patriotic feats,

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,440
they awakened all the people.

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,640
I firmly believe that as long as we hold on a little longer,

70
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,960
the situation will definitely change.

71
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,440
Of course, in the process,

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
everyone should also take care of themselves.

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,560
You can't be rash or make unnecessary sacrifices.

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
Beware of reactionaries jumping into a wall.

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,360
Although it is such a dark time,

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
I still believe

77
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,000
as long as we unite and work hard,

78
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,680
the final victory will belong to us.

82
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
all the students arrested yesterday were put in the Horse God Temple.

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
But now the Horse God Temple along the North River

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
are surrounded by ordinary people.

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
You can't stop anyone who asks for food.

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,320
This is great.

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,760
People have helped us a lot.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
The students have food.

89

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
Allow ordinary people to deliver food.

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,440
Jiaozi, baozi, noodles, anything can do.

94
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
You can also send clothes.

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,440
No, Chief Wu.

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
It-- It's not a food market.

97

Give it to the students.

126

Divide it over.

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,960
It's this classroom.

128
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,480
It's the classroom that I attended before.

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
I'll just take this place as a classroom.

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,760
So many.

131
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,320
Take them all.

132
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,280
Read more books.

Before I came in, I wanted to borrow books.

137
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,480
There are two books on this list.

138

Go and borrow them for me.

139

Who will dare?

144

Who dares to bully her?

145

179

was passed on by my classmates who came back.

180

185
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,440
First, this morning,

186
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,360
tens of thousands of students in Beijing took to the streets to petition,

187
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
fighting against the military police.

188

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Liu Haiwei.

190
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,160
Liu Haiwei was also injured?

191
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,960
Luo Zhanglong.

192
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,000
Which hospital?

193
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
They say that there's no serious problem.

194
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
But others saw him

195
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,360
with his head bandaged.

196
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
You give them with some more baozi

197
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
when Shiyan leaves later.

198
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,320
Second, Beijing has now officially ordered

199
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,440
to change the president of Peking University.

200
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Cai Yuanpei was replaced by Hu Renyuan.

201
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
Forget it. Forget it.

202
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
There's still some good news.

203
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,280
This morning,

204
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,120
the military police only beat people, not arrest people.

205
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,520
Why?

206
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,280
Because there is no place to hold students.

207
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
This shows that the reactionaries are afraid.

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
Second, today, not just students

209
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,600
but workers, merchants, and citizens

210
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
petitioned on the streets.

211
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,960
The third point, and the most important,

212
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
A telegram was sent from Shanghai.

213
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
Workers from the Commercial Press, the five major yarn mills,

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
and the Zhonghua Bookstore went on strike.

215
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
All major shops in Nanjing Road went on strike.

216
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
Even the entrance of the barber shop has a sign saying that

217
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
the state cares so little about appearance

218
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
that you don't have to visit the shop.

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
Do you know what this is called?

220
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,360
It's called three strikes.

221
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,400
Students stop studying, workers stop working, merchants stop selling.

222
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,520
Mr. Dazhao said

223
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,800
as long as three strikes are formed,

224
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,760
the nature of the student movement has changed.

225
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
Everyone is on their feet.

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
All classes

227
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
are involved in patriotic action.

228
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,240
Can victory be far behind?

229
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,360
Excellent.

230
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,120
But Mr. Dazhao said

231
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,840
don't let Mr. Zhongfu know this yet,

232
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
so as not to get excited and do something drastic.

233
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,120
I'm almost excited.

234
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
You have locked me up.

235
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm just like you.

236
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
Zhongxie gave a deadly order

237
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,320
for me to stay close to Mr. Shouchang.

238
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,320
Don't say it's really dangerous.

239
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,440
The day before yesterday, I saw

240
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,040
Liu Yipin staring at Mr. Shouchang.

241
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,840
Liu Yipin?

242
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,240
Correct.

243
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
He and Zhang Fengzai are the same people.

244
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
Now, the police department

245
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,280
has targeted Mr. Shouchang.

246
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,120
So Zhongxie won't let me leave

247
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,320
Mr. Shouchang at all.

248
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
Don't talk about this. Deng Zhongxia will take my place now.

249
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,280
Get some baozi out quickly.

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,480
Mr. Shouchang hasn't eaten yet.

251
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,080
Take some more.

252
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,960
Take them all.

253
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,440
Okay.

254
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Madam, I'm going.

255
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:34,960
Okay.

256
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
Be careful on the road. Okay?

257
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,360
Good. Thank you.

258
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,480
Be careful!

259
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,360
Okay.

260
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,680
Sir.

261
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,520
The present situation is generally like this.

262
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,960
Many of our arrested students

263
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,200
are imprisoned in the Faculty of Arts, Science and Law of Peking University.

264
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,640
Now the citizens are going there

265
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,080
to send them water, food,

266
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,960
and clothes.

267
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,480
So I think

268
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
their situation should be relatively stable.

269
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
But I don't think it will last long.

270
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,400
I will go with a few students to organize

271
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,120
a visit to them,

272
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
and let them not worry.

273
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,960
Good.

274
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,240
Students.

275
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,520
Now the struggle has reached a white-hot stage.

276
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
The citizens have already risen up.

277
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
I believe we just have to grind our teeth for a few more days.

278
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
The reactionaries will want to cooperate.

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,840
That turning point will appear.

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,480
But,

281
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,240
at this current time,

282
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
we need to calm down more,

283
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
in case the reactionaries jump the wall.

284
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,800
Understand?

285
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,600
Understood.

286
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,160
Good.

287
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
What is the situation in the Third Hospital now?

288
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,880
The Third Hospital is in good condition.

289
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
But the Second Hospital is a bit tight.

290
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,280
How about this?

291
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,320
Let some students

292
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,840
go and see the situation of the Second Hospital.

293
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,280
At the same time, tell the students of the Second Hospital

294
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
to not be impulsive.

295
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,560
Be calm and avoid the military police

296
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
at this time to prevent being caught in the crossfire.

297
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,280
Got it.

298
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,920
Madam.

299
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,800
Sir.

300
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,840
Look who's here.

301
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,280
Madam.

302
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,520
Come in quickly.

303
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,280
Why did you come all the way here?

304
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,240
It's raining again.

305
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,400
I asked questions along the way and came over.

306
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,280
It's not far.

307
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,320
Okay.

308
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,720
Madam. Hello, madam.

309
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,760
Hello, students.

310
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,720
Dear!

311
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,280
Didn't we discuss this at home?

312
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,800
You should stay at home.

313
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
It's so messy in the streets outside now.

314
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,680
People are being arrested everywhere.

315
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,960
You said you were calm.

316
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
What are you doing here?

317
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
I just heard that the school also has arrested people.

318
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,360
I'm not sure.

319
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
I just came to see you.

320
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,960
I brought you some food

321
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
and a change of clothes.

322
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,560
You're still carrying something so heavy.

323
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
Dear!

324
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,520
Don't say anything when all your students are here.

325
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
You students haven't eaten yet, have you?

326
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,440
I came to bake you sesame cakes

327
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,400
and baked wheaten cakes.

328
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,440
They're still hot.

329
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,960
Come on, everybody, come and eat.

330
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,800
Thank you, madam. Thank you, madam.

331
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
Take them. Take them. Take them.

332
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,520
Let me help you.

333
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
Try them all.

334
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,600
Delicious!

335
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,160
Delicious!

336
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
Try, try, try.

337
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,880
There's a baked wheaten cake here

338
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,209
Here. It's delicious.

339
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:46,480
Delicious.

340
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Delicious. Take some more.

341
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,400
Would you like some pickles?

342
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,280
No thank you!

343
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
Then, sir, we'll go first.

344
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Be sure to be safe.

345
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,320
Okay.

346
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,840
Students must pay attention to safety.

347
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,040
Okay.

348
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,720
If anyone is hungry, take some more.

349
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
It's okay. It's okay.

350
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,800
Let's go.

351
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,400
Be sure to be safe.

352
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,280
Okay. Okay.

353
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,080
We're going.

354
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,720
Good.

355
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,680
Soup, dear?

356
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,880
Pour me a bowl.

357
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
I won't lie, I'm really hungry.

358
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,280
I just asked Shiyan to go to brother Zhongfu's house

359
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,400
to get me something to eat.

360
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
He hasn't come back yet.

361
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
You really saved my life

362
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
just in time.

363
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,280
Here.

364
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,400
It's the first time I've walked into school.

365
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
The school is so beautiful.

366
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
I remember when you were little,

367
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
carrying a schoolbag,

368
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
bouncing to school.

369
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,280
I watched you at the gate of the courtyard

370
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,960
and saw you disappear.

371
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
I really admire you.

372
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
I admire the fact that you can go to school.

373
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
I think the most beautiful voice in the world

374
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
is the loud and bright sound of school reading.

375
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,800
I also walked into the school today.

376
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,520
Look at these children.

377
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,480
How energetic.

378
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,800
Dear.

379
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,800
After dinner.

380
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
Let me show you around.

381
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,800
What's going on?

382
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,240
My stomach hurts.

383
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,280
No. No.

384
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,160
No pain.

385
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
Do you feel it?

386
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,000
He's kicking me.

387
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,840
He's kicking me, too

388
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,920
What are you kicking us for?

389
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
You want to run out, too?

390
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,760
I see.

391
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,920
You also want to go to Peking University

392
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
you want to see father, your teacher.

393
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,000
Don't you?

394
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
Father is very strict.

395
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,160
When the time comes, if you cry,

396
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
don't blame father.

397
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,840
Dear.

398
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,880
Sorry.

399
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,280
Look, I brought you to Beijing.

400
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,440
I should have stayed with you.

401
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
As a result, I was too busy to go home

402
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
and in turn let you worry about me.

403
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,560
I'm sorry.

404
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
I have hands and feet.

405
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,440
What do I want you to do with me?

406
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,240
I am pregnant,

407
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,200
not sick again.

408
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,200
I can manage myself.

409
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,320
Don't worry about it.

410
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
Look at yourself.

411
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,200
You lost weight

412
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,240
in just a few days.

413
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
I still don't know you.

414
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,760
When you are busy,

415
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,280
you get a bite of cold and hot food.

416
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,960
You're just playing around.

417
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,480
We can't do this anymore.

418
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,920
I brought you a change of clothes.

419
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,080
Are these two enough?

420
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,800
Is it enough?

421
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,080
I can't get away with

422
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,880
the two children either.

423
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,520
Thankfully Shugui's daughter-in-law helped me today.

424
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,280
Otherwise, I won't be able to visit you.

425
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
So, dear.

426
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,120
Let's discuss it again.

427
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,080
I promise you.

428
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
From now on, I will have a good meal.

429
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
But you have to promise me.

430
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
You can't go out again.

431
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,640
You said it was so messy outside now.

432
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm by your side.

433
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,280
I can't take care of you.

434
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
I already owe you a lot.

435
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,320
Silly lump, you know what?

436
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,280
Baohua can be yours now.

437
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,200
He reads in the morning, every morning.

438
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,800
He can't recite poems.

439
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,000
He doesn't even eat.

440
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,840
It's like when you were little.

441
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,200
You were like this when you were a kid.

442
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,320
Can't recite the words.

443
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,160
You hide in that chicken coop and cry.

444
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm afraid I'll hear

445
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,360
his mouth still humming and chirpping.

446
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,720
I'm telling you.

447
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,320
Where did we get a wild cat?

448
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:52,960
Dear.

449
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
You sleep at night.

450
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,680
Still studying there.

451
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,920
That candle burned your hair.

452
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,720
You don't even know,

453
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,320
it almost burned down our house.

454
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,720
Dear.

455
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,680
You forgot all about it.

456
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Dear.

457
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,040
I want to talk to you about my heart.

458
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,880
I think I've been Li Dazhao all my life.

459
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,080
I am worthy of the world.

460
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,080
I am worthy of my teacher.

461
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
Worthy of my friends.

462
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm worthy of my students, too.

463
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,040
But I'm sorry for you.

464
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,520
Ever since you followed me,

465
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,200
always worried about me.

466
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
Always worrying about me.

467
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
I feel sorry for you.

468
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Shouchang.

469
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
You are a man of great importance.

470
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Every time you tell me the big things,

471
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
I can understand some of them,

472
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
I don't understand the others.

473
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:36,960
But,

474
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,320
I don't care if I understand it or not.

475
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,280
I just know

476
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,800
that you are working for others,

477
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,320
working for the common people.

478
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,760
It's a good thing to do.

479
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,600
So I can't hold you back.

480
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
I will keep my home for you.

481
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,640
You can rest assured.

482
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,080
I think so.

483
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,520
I'll take the baby with me one of these days

484
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,560
back to Daheituo

485
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
and give birth there.

486
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,760
I don't want to distract you.

487
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
So you don't have to worry about us.

488
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, right.

489
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,720
This is

490
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,080
the money

491
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,680
that Mr. Cai deducted

492
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,120
from your salary.

493
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
I've been saving it for you.

494
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,040
I took out all my household items.

495
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,240
There are so many left.

496
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,400
I know you are useful.

497
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,440
Here you go.

498
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,960
Silly lump.

499
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,240
Do you know what I was

500
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,040
most happy about?

501
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,360
I was most happy

502
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,200
when I received your letter from Tianjin

503
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,200
to me from Japan.

504
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,120
I took those letters

505
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,880
and went to our village

506
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
and let Mr. Da read it to me.

507
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160
After reading it,

508
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,080
I was under the oil lamp at night.

509
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,080
I just read it over and over again.

510
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,160
I painted with my hand

511
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
those words you wrote.

512
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,480
I was just thinking.

513
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,880
I wish I could read.

514
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,320
If I could read,

515
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,080
I could write a letter

516
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,920
to my silly lump.

517
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,440
I'll be able to talk my heart out

518
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,800
to my silly lump.

519
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,280
Don't look.

520
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,960
Turn your face away.

521
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,440
What word?

522
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,960
Li!

523
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,120
This?

524
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,920
Da!

525
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,560
This?

526
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,360
Zhao!

527
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,080
What about this?

528
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,040
I still don't know these three words.

529
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,880
Dear.

530
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,400
I promise you.

531
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,920
When the day comes

532
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,920
when the school can set up

533
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,040
a quiet desk.

534
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,720
When you can hear the sound of reading aloud.

535
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,480
I'll take you with me.

536
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,320
Just the two of us

537
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
in a classroom

538
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,240
with sunlight coming in from the outside.

539
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,880
I'll teach you one stroke,

540
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,840
one mark,

541
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,440
one stroke,

542
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,520
one mark at a time.

543
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,680
Then I sitting down at the bottom,

544
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,800
waiting for you.

545
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
What will you be waiting for?

546
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
You writing a letter to me by yourself.

547
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
I want to see that.

548
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,960
I promise you.

549
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,760
Eat quickly.

550
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,400
Time to eat.

551
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,360
Time to eat.

552
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,760
Time to eat.

553
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:51,680
[Zhao Renlan, wife of Li Dazhao, died 28 May 1933, aged 49. In June 1936, the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee posthumously recognized her as a member of the Communist Party of China.]

554
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,040
What are you going to do?

555
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,360
Go out for a walk.

556
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,400
You can't.

557
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,320
Zhongfu, you can't.

558
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,440
I finished writing my manuscript.

559
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,880
I'll go out and have a look.

560
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
Didn't you promise Shouchang not to go out?

561
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,240
I finished writing my manuscript.

562
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm going out to have a look.

563
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,040
Yes, I know.

564
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Whether Shouchang asked me to stay at home

565
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,480
to edit "New Youth"

566
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
or Yannian doesn't go out to watch over me.

567
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,640
You can't.

568
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,280
It's all for my own safety. I know.

569
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,600
I didn't want to cause you any trouble.

570
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Second,

571
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,560
I really want to calm down at home

572
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,480
and write the manuscript of this issue well.

573
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
Sir, you can't go out.

574
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,880
I need and I have to know

575
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,600
the present--

576
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,000
You can't.

577
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,720
--development of the situation.

578
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,400
I really want to do this.

579
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,920
Can you stop it?

580
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Hurry and steam baozi.

581
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,560
I have to send it to them.

582
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,840
Severely punish traitors!

583
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,320
Severely punish traitors!

584
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty!

585
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
Severely punish traitors!

586
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,240
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty!

587
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,840
Go. Keep moving.

588
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,880
Be honest.

589
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,880
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty!

590
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
Severely punish traitors!

591
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty!

592
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,840
Severely punish traitors!

593
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,920
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty!

594
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
Severely punish traitors!

595
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,560
Lang and Sister Hua have flowers,

596
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,560
under the ridge they go.

597
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,520
Drop a seed, sprouts a bud.

598
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,280
What stem, what leaf blooms what flower?

599
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,040
I've returned to China

600
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,880
to establish a magazine

601
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,680
that will serve as a rallying cry

602
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,920
for the political and ethical awakening of the nation!

603
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
I pledge to you all

604
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,920
that if I run the magazine for ten years

605
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,200
the whole country will change its thinking!

606
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,240
The country is in danger.

607
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,080
But the authorities fought with the strength of a lion

608
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
to crush our patriotism.

609
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
It makes me feel bullied in my own country

610
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,480
as much as in Japan.

611
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,880
What hope is there for such a country?

612
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,560
Sir,

613
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
you have to save this country.

614
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
Save this nation.

615
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,800
A country like ours,

616
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,040
where most of the people are farmers and illiterate.

617
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
How can we make this work?

618
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,000
With the road where science and democracy intersect.

619
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,760
What stem, what leaf blooms what flower?

620
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,280
There is no light in the liberal arts room.

621
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
Then where would he go?

622
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,160
Let's look at the courtyard.

623
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,400
Chen Zhongfu!

624
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,160
Zhongfu!

625
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,240
Brother Zhongfu!

626
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,720
Brother Zhongfu!

627
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,240
Is there?

628
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,440
No.

629
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,960
I said watch him, watch him.

630
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,840
With his character

631
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,040
and such a situation now,

632
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,560
something will happen to him.

633
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,080
Brother Zhongfu!

634
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
Chen Zhongfu!

635
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,040
Brother Zhongfu!

636
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,600
Look. Look. Look.

637
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,720
Where are you going, Shouchang?

638
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm looking.

639
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,240
Where are you going to look?

640
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,080
We looked in the First Hospital, the Second Hospital, the Third Hospital,

641
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,160
the Horse God Temple, the North River, the Red Building courtyard.

642
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,960
He is not here.

643
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,640
Junman's sister-in-law is also looking for him.

644
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,680
Let's not worry now.

645
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,960
Let's think about where he will go.

646
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
All I can think about is home and school.

647
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,280
Junman's sister-in-law is waiting for him at home.

648
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,120
The two of us will wait here, at school.

649
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,040
Shizhi, let me ask you a question.

650
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,280
Is this still

651
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,760
the Republic that we are fighting for?

652
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,360
Is this the Republic that the martyrs

653
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,680
Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin sacrificed their lives for?

654
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,120
In this classroom,

655
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,560
we could have put a clean desk

656
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,920
and let the students be quiet inside

657
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,920
to enjoy the pleasure of knowledge.

658
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,400
But now it's a prison.

659
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,440
Inside, my students are locked up.

660
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,960
Your students are locked up.

661
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,560
Chen Zhongfu's students are locked up.

662
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,640
What's scary is the doorway.

663
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,480
There are still a group of parents in pain

664
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
with their pleading eyes

665
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
seeking help from others,

666
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,480
even kneeling down to the military police.

667
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,160
What's even more ridiculous is that

668
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
they are patriotic for their children

669
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
and still kneel down to the military police.

670
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,280
What's wrong with this country?

671
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Don't you think this country is ridiculous?

672
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,760
Shouchang, don't blame yourself.

673
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,120
This is not your responsibility alone.

674
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,040
We really can't go on foolhardy.

675
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,680
Now each and every one of us

676
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,280
have to think about it,

677
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,960
and review their thinking.

678
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Otherwise, only students will be humiliated.

679
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,520
Only the school was damaged.

680
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,560
It's like I was

681
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
written in "The Humiliation of Beijing Students".

682
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,560
Shizhi, are we at fault?

683
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,760
Are the students at fault?

684
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
You say such things at this time.

685
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
Aren't you opening your eyes at the reactionary government?

686
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,480
At this time,

687
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,320
don't put a hat on me, Shouchang.

688
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,560
You mentioned your students just now.

689
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
Yes, we all saw them.

690
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,680
You feel bad and I feel bad.

691
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,760
But what can I do?

692
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
If we hadn't had a general strike,

693
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,880
if we adopt some mitigating measures,

694
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,400
our Peking University won't

695
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,840
have come to this point.

696
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,920
Shizhi, why do we want to strike?

697
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,600
Why are we striking?

698
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,600
Is it not because the government wants to sign

699
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
the Paris Peace Treaty that humiliated the country?

700
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,480
Didn't we protest again and again

701
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,400
repeatedly

702
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
to no avail?

703
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,840
Is patriotism guilty?

704
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,760
Traitorous deeds!

705
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,120
Patriotism has many ways.

706
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
There are many ways and means to save the country.

707
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,480
And, Shouchang,

708
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,520
I heard that you recently

709
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,120
have been advocating the Russian Revolution.

710
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,000
Telling us Chinese people

711
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,600
that we must take the Russian road.

712
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,720
It's dangerous.

713
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
What's the danger?

714
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I advise you not to always dictate the American way.

715
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,960
Don't always believe in Dewey's experimentalism.

716
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
You should be as compatible as Mr. Cai said.

717
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,880
You have to have a look.

718
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
The situation and changes after the war.

719
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,920
You're going too far again.

720
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
We're talking about the present.

721
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,040
How do we save Peking University?

722
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,400
How do we rescue our students

723
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,520
who have been arrested?

724
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,520
We have to do something. We have to do something.

725
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
It's no use worrying.

726
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,080
We have to be quiet. Being quiet makes us wise.

727
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
Think of a way!

728
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
My opinion is that we should cancel the strike.

729
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,640
We have to give the government a step down.

730
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,240
Never cancel the strike.

731
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,120
The strike must not be cancelled at this time.

732
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,800
We don't have a second way now.

733
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,840
There is only one way for us.

734
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,400
That is to adopt a more determined way.

735
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,200
We must fight!

736
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,320
Fight?

737
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,680
Do you still have to fight?

738
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,960
What's the use of fighting?

739
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,520
Now you and Chen Zhongfu are covered in scars.

740
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Do you still have to fight and go to extremes?

741
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,040
Chen Zhongfu, he is the leader of our new culture.

742
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,920
The three of us,

743
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
why can't we just do a new culture?

744
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
Why do we want to wade

745
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,600
into this muddy water?

746
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,200
If you go on like this,

747
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,680
not only is Peking University finished

748
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,680
but you two,

749
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
you two will ruin your academic career.

750
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,160
You will ruin your happy family.

751
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,360
Shizhi.

752
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's advocate the New Culture Movement

753
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,920
to inspire people's wisdom.

754
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,800
So what happens when the people wake up?

755
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,440
There's bound to be some action.

756
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,520
Just thinking will do nothing.

757
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,120
You can't save the country.

758
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,960
I'm not saying

759
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,800
we don't act at all.

760
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,840
I mean, you must stop going to extremes.

761
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,640
There should be an objective standard for not being extreme.

762
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,160
If a country's power trumps justice,

763
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,080
if a country

764
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,360
is involved the core interests

765
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
and the will of the people cannot be expressed,

766
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
then the citizens of this country

767
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,000
can exercise their democratic rights.

768
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,840
Let's take Japan as an example.

769
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,120
China was defeated in the Sino-Japanese Jiawu War.

770
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
We ceded land for compensation.

771
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
We even gave Taiwan to the Japanese.

772
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,160
We couldn't help it. We had no temper.

773
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,600
But now we are a victorious country, Shizhi.

774
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,520
Why does Germany take our Qingdao

775
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
and gave it to Japan?

776
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,120
Is there any justice in this?

777
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
If we let those traitors go,

778
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,040
if you trample on public opinion wantonly,

779
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,240
can our country

780
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,400
still be called a democratic republic?

781
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,720
Do we deserve to be called citizens of our country?

782
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
So for the national interest,

783
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,680
now we need a complete revolution.

784
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,560
Combine ideological awakening with practical awakening.

785
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,040
I, Li Dazhao, would like to be this pionner.

786
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,280
I'll never regret even if I die many times.

787
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,000
Even if thousands of people are gone.

788
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,960
Zhongfu, where have you been?

789
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,480
I'm fine.

790
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,560
I sat there for a while.

791
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,640
I, uh

792
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,640
I went for a look.

793
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,600
You're right, Shouchang.

794
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,320
Letting me stay at home and not letting me go.

795
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,240
I'm going home.

796
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm finished. I'm--

797
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,480
I'm hungry.

798
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,400
I want to go home for dinner.

799
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
I'm thirsty, too.

800
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,800
No big deal.

801
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,320
I'm fine.

802
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,480
Zhongfu.

803
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,360
Chen Zhongfu.

804
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
The Republic is dead.

805
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,560
I will not die.

806
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,800
Mom!

807
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,080
When will dad come back?

808
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,280
I'm hungry.

809
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,560
Wait a minute.

810
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
We won't eat well until Dad comes back.

811
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,120
You came back.

812
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,480
Why don't you eat?

813
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,160
How can we eat if you don't come back?

814
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,080
Yannian and Qiaonian didn't eat at noon,

815
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,280
waiting for you.

816
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Come on, sit down.

817
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,520
I made a hot pot

818
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,040
for everyone to feel better.

819
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,480
Come, sit down.

820
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Sit down, sit down.

821
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,560
Junman.

822
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,200
I want to say sorry to you,

823
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,720
because

824
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,320
I am not a qualified husband.

825
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,640
Yannian,

826
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,720
Qiaonian,

827
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,080
Henian,

828
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,080
Zimei,

829
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,640
and Bai Lan,

830
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,760
and Yuying and Songnian in their hometown.

831
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,640
I want to say sorry to you, too,

832
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,040
because I am not a qualified father.

833
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,760
It is better to come back than anything else.

834
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,800
Don't say sorry.

835
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,280
Just hear me out.

836
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,960
I stayed at home for three days.

837
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,520
I went out for a look today.

838
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,240
You can imagine

839
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
what I saw.

840
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,120
I was a young man,

841
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,920
a revolutionary who was determined to save the country,

842
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
but I am not a good teacher.

843
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
Because I look at those students

844
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,440
imprisoned for loving the country.

845
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,840
So I have to take this step.

846
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,920
Your father

847
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,160
has to kill himself before he dies.

848
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,280
The children have just lived a stable life

849
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,360
for several years.

850
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,040
But in the future,

851
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,360
you may face different situations again.

852
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,040
because I can't just stand by and watch

853
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,480
and see my students bleed and cry

854
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,000
and not doing anything about it.

855
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,000
I have to fight with them

856
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,760
because I love this country.

857
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,120
This country is not only mine.

858
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,960
It's also yours.

859
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,920
I want to do something for this country.

860
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,680
From now on,

861
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,800
maybe because of me,

862
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,680
you will also suffer.

863
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,960
Maybe because of me in the future,

864
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,760
you will also suffer hardships.

865
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,600
So,

866
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,120
I have to say sorry to you.

867
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,360
This glass of wine is to make amends to you.

868
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,760
Are you okay?

869
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,120
Are you okay?

870
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Because of the Six No's, I can't drink.

871
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
But today, I also want to propose a toast to apology.

872
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,880
Because I am also determined to devote myself to my country.

873
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,920
As the eldest son,

874
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
I may not be filial to my parents.

875
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
I can't do one's duty for younger brothers and sisters.

876
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,400
Today, I'll apologize with this glass of wine.

877
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,520
Me too.

878
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,160
I'll drink this wine myself.

879
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,000
Alright. Alright.

880
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,360
Let's not say anything unlucky.

881
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Come on, everybody, sit down and eat.

882
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,040
Our--

883
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,640
Our family must live well.

884
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
Sit down, sit down.

885
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,560
Dad.

886
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,720
I'll fill it up for you.

887
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,040
Let's eat.

888
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,720
Let's eat.
