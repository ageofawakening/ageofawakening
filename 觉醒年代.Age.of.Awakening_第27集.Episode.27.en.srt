If we want to really change a country,

we can't do it alone.

75
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,960
and fought against them.

76

Later, he was dismissed and returned home.

77

78

Before he passed away,

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
he called me to his side and told me.

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,040
Xingang, the loss of Qingdao was on me.

81

When we have Qingdao back one day,

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,800
you must tell me.

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Qingdao should be returned to us.

88
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,080
Father,

89
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
Qingdao is back now.

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,800
Qingdao is back.

91

But now what's going on?

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
The last thing my father said before he left was

93
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
You Lu's poem "Shi Er"

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
That after death everything becomes void, I surely perceive.

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,840
Yet, not to have seen my country unified is still what makes me grieve.

96
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,200
The day comes when our troops take back the old land.

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,400
Forget not to tell me when you remember me at my grave.

98
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,120
Xingang, being sad can't help right now.

99
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
You must have stayed up the whole night.

100
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
I also had a sleepless night.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
I wrote three articles.

102
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,800
Bai Lan, read this for everyone.

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
In the Paris Peace Conference,

104
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,040
all countries focus on their own interests.

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
What justice? What permanent peace?

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,960
What President Wilson's Fourteen Points?

107
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
All has become a worthless empty talk.

108
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,920
France, Italy and Japan are three militaristic countries.

109
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Because it didn't meet with their desire to invade other land,

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
they threw a tantrum, put on a show and threatened to quit the peace meeting.

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
I say this meeting is all about share the spoils.

112
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Was it about permanent peace with the world?

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
True happiness of mankind?

114
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,960
They are thousands of miles apart.

115
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
It has to be the people all over the world standing together,

116
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
can this be solved directly.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
If you rely

118
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,760
on a few politicians and diplomats

119
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
to share the spoils of war,

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
there will be no fair outcome.

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,240
Sir, you mean

122
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
we cannot rely on others,

123
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
that we the people must stand up,

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
and do it ourselves.

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Yes, you are right.

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840

127
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600

128
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,320
it's no use being sad.

129

The imperialist governments are unreliable.

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160

131
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
What is reliable then?

132
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
Ourselves.

133

At time like this,

134
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,440

136

Get into action!

140
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Resolutely resist that shameless peace treaty!

141
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,720

Tell me more.

166
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,840
At the end of the day, it's just two words, no signing.

167

The refusal to sign.

168
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,720
It's easy to say. Have you considered the consequences?

169
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
We discussed it for two days.

170

All the consequences have been considered.

171

But a telegram from Lu Zhengxiang said

172

if we don't sign the peace treaty,

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
at least Japan, Britain, France

174
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
and Italy, these four countries

175
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,160

is not just Germany's rights and interests in Shandong,

but the rights and interests of the whole country.

180

That kind of loss is just too big.

told me about this problem.

186

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,200
It's very clear.

189
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
He thinks we should sign the treaty.

190
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
So as not to lose big over such a small issue.

191
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,120
Lu Zhengxiang cannot see the bigger picture and not follow his order.

192
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
He should be held accountable just for suggesting putting this country and its people into disaster.

193
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Botang, what are you talking about now,

194
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
isn't this a discussion?

195
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,440
Calm down.

196
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,720
President Xu.

197
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,200
Premier Qian.

198
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
Open your eyes.

199
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
If the Republic of China,

200
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
if this government signs this peace treaty,

201
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
do you dare to step out of the gate of the Presidential Palace ever again?

202
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,000
Brother Botang,

203
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,920
that sounds almost horrifying.

204
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
Now I need you to answer Lu Zhengxiang's question.

205
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
To sign or to not sign.

206
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Which option

207
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,520
will lead to a greater loss of this country's interests?

208
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,400
Lu Zhengxiang is simply a worrywart.

209
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,280
He's talking nonsense.

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,200
All the spearheads of the Paris Peace Conference

211
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
will aim at Germany.

212
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,160
The Versailles system will tear Germany to pieces.

213
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
How can Germany then bargain with China?

214
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,960
Anyone with diplomatic common sense

215
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,640
will not raise this kind of question.

216
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:17,840
Sit.

217
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
According to what you say,

218
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,160
Lu Zhengxiang is worrying too much.

219
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,080
This is not a problem at all.

220
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,640
Premier Qian.

221
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,080
I-

222
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
I really want to hear your opinion.

223
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,840
I-

224
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
I will listen to the president.

225
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,680
Sit down.

226
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,720
Acting Chief Chen, what's your opinion?

227
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
I am a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

228
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
I already signed the statement of refusal.

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,560
Mr. President.

230
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,240
This is what we have drawn up.

231
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
A telegram to the Chinese delegation, the refusal to sign.

232
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,560
Please take a look, President.

233
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
What's your opinion?

234
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
We refuse to sign.

235
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
Since everyone agrees we should not sign.

236
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Then please Premier Qian,

237
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
send it in the name of the State Council.

238
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
But this matter must be kept secret.

239
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
The young people can't know.

240
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
Yes, President.

241
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
You go to the telecommunications office right now.

242
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,360
Send a telegram to Lu Zhengxiang immediately.

243
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,320
It's still dark in Paris.

244
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,680
Right now

245
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,280
I want to lambaste Lu Zhengxiang.

246
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,640
This treacherous clown.

247
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
Why does he advocate for signing the treaty?

248
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
You don't need to send a telegram for that matter.

249
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,520
I can tell you the truth.

250
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,120
What truth?

251
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,240
So,

252
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,320
Lu Zhengxiang never once said he agreed to sign the treaty.

253
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
Duan Qirui asked him to analyze the current situation.

254
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
How will Europe and America, including Germany,

255
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,440
react to the Shandong issue?

256
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
In Lu Zhengxiang's analysis report,

257
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
there's one paragraph about Germany.

258
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,120
Duan Qirui, underlined that alone

259
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
and commented with eight words.

260
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,320
Not worthy losing even more over small matters.

261
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
Cao Rulin presented that to Xu Shichang,

262
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
said that Lu Zhengxiang's point of view

263
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
is that we should sign the treaty for the long-term benefit.

264
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,880
How do you know all those details?

265
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,040
Lin Changmin came just now.

266
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,320
You were not here.

267
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
He asked me to tell you all those.

268
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,880
I see.

269
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,760
No wonder Xu Shichang behaved weirdly.

270
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
He wanted to use me as an excuse to deal with Duan Qirui.

271
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,520
That old fox.

272
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,680
Did Xu Shichang agree to the refusal message?

273
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
Barely, but he did.

274
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
He has asked Qian Nengxun, in the name of the State Council,

275
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
to issue a telegram to convey the refusal.

276
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,920
Great.

277
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,080
Now you can have a good sleep.

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm still not at ease.

279
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
Go to the telecommunications office immediately.

280
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,480
In my name,

281
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
send an urgent telegram to Lu Zhengxiang.

282
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
Take note of the telegram.

283
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
Stupid as one might be,

284
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,600
one shall not make the same mistake again.

285
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
The Chinese people will not allow a second Li Hongzhang.

286
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,520
Indeed.

287
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,040
I'll send it right away.

288
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,960
Tell him to respond as soon as possible.

289
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,200
Very well.

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Shiyan, do you need more glue there?

291
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,600
Yeah, after I'm done with this one.

292
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay.

293
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,640
Here.

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,640
Classmates!

295
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,640
Mr. Shouchang, Mr. Shouchang.

296
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,840
Hello, sir. Hello, sir.

297
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,520
Let me tell you three things.

298
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,960
First,

299
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
Wang Daxie called Mr. Cai

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
saying that the national government had sent out a telegram

301
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
to the Chinese delegation in Paris

302
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
about the refusal to sign the peace treaty.

303
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,920
Good!

304
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
Second,

305
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
the National Foreign Affairs Association

306
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,360
sent out a notice

307
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,880
that the National Assembly

308
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,840
will be held in Central Park on May 7th.

309
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,600
We are to boycott the Paris Peace Treaty.

310
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,040
Peking University,

311
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,800
along with students from other schools,

312
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,080
will be the main force in this demonstration.

313
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,360
Third is that,

314
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
the whole country has taken action.

315
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
Especially Shandong.

316
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,960
Shanghai.

317
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,840
Guangzhou.

318
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,840
Through different approaches,

319
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,800
they all

320
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,920
started boycott movement.

321
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,160
Thanks to the New Culture Movement,

322
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,640
we set up the two flags of science and democracy.

323
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,120
We can break the old world,

324
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:56,955
[Xu Deheng, styled Chusheng, Student at Peking University]

325
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,800
and get to witness this new one.

326
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,720
I remember Mr. Zhongfu

327
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,400
once said this,

328
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,520
that he would not talk about politics for twenty years.

329
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,920
He shall only concentrate on enlightenment.

330
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
Well, now he realized

331
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,640
that he was biased back then.

332
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Given the fact that science and democracy

333
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
are inseparable from politics itself.

334
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,360
Democracy itself is politics.

335
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
If we want to talk about science and democracy,

336
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,880
then politics will come knocking at the door.

337
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,320
No point hiding from it.

338
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,920
Think about it, everybody.

339
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
Everything that happened in Peking University in the last three years.

340
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,400
Which one was not related to politics?

341
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,720
I have a question for all of you.

342
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,960
What is democracy?

343
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Democracy means that the people are the masters of their country.

344
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
Xingang is right.

345
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,840
China belongs to the people.

346
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
So of course it is the people who take responsibility for it.

347
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,000
The people shall make decisions.

348
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
This is what a country should do.

349
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,520
But the Republic of China has been around for eight years.

350
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,280
I want to ask everyone

351
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,560
was there even one thing,

352
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
that we got the power to decide.

353
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,320
None.

354
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,680
Right?

355
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
Last year, Duan Qirui

356
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,120
signed a secret agreement with Japan.

357
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,880
Did he ask for people's opinions?

358
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,160
No.

359
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
Even the Chinese delegation

360
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
didn't know about such a thing.

361
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,480
A total liar.

362
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,920
The people was deceived.

363
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
The people was fooled.

364
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
So I said

365
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
this Paris peace conference is indeed terrible.

366
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,000
However, there is another way to see it.

367
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,440
There can be a good aspect.

368
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
How so?

369
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
Because of this Paris Peace Conference,

370
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,280
the Chinesep people are now awake.

371
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
If China wants to develop,

372
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,360
opposition to feudalism and leading new culture is not enough.

373
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,880
We also need to stand out,

374
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,640
fight against imperialism,

375
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,960
defend our own sovereignty.

376
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
To achieve these,

377
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
we have to wake the people up.

378
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,320
Only when the people wake up can China have hope.

379
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,560
So, my fellow students.

380
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
Our lecture group on civilian education

381
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,200
needs to get close to the grassroots as soon as possible.

382
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Go into the factory.

383
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
Go into the fields.

384
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,360
All of our groups

385
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
need to reach out to every corner of society.

386
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,960
To awaken the people.

387
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,160
What do you think?

388
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,120
Sir,

389
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,120
we are now working on establish a union.

390
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,440
A student union for all higher education insititutes in Beijing.

391
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
We will connect all the schools,

392
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
make it easier for organizing large-scale activities.

393
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,480
Our public education lecture group

394
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,920
will be divided into four smaller teams.

395
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,320
We are giving a series of speeches in Changxindian and other places respectively.

396
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,920
We are organizing a demonstration right now.

397
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
At the National Convention on May 7th,

398
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
there will be a demonstration of 100,000 people.

399
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,840
Good!

400
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,880
Students.

401
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
Let's act now.

402
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,800
Yes!

403
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,680
Get this ready.

404
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
The government has made it clear,

405
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
Lu Zhenxiang will refuse to sign the peace treaty.

406
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
So, for all the speeches at this National Convention,

407
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
be sure to pay attention to discretion.

408
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,200
There must be no voice to denounce the government.

409
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,920
Committee Chairman.

410
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,040
One important thing.

411
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
That is, there should never be

412
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
a voice critcizing President Wilson.

413
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao from Peking University,

414
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,680
in the" Weekly Review",

415
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,240
publicly accussed President Wilson being useless.

416
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
We cannot promote this kind of behavior.

417
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,200
It endangers the bigger picture.

418
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
We should target the Japanese

419
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,880
and the pro-Japanese factions in China.

420
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,760
Cao Rulin,

421
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,720
Zhang Zongxiang,

422
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,520
and Lu Zongyu.

423
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,160
Committee Chairman.

424
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,760
What is it?

425
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,360
Something bad.

426
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,680
Speak.

427
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,000
The State Council has secretly sent a message to Paris.

428
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,280
They agreed to sign the treaty!

429
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,160
Right, I need to go now.

430
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,200
How is that possible?

431
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,040
A guy from Lin Changmin's hometown works in the office.

432
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,240
He sent that telegram himself.

433
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
He told Lin Changmin secretly.

434
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,880
Source is solid.

435
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,000
Where is Lin Changmin now?

436
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll go find him.

437
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
Lin Changmin just

438
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
handed Xu Shichang a resignation letter.

439
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,680
He asked me to bring you this note.

440
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,960
This government is treacherous.

441
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,520
I can never go along with it.

442
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,120
I am resigning too.

443
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
Chairman, at this time

444
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
you can't just walk away.

445
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,560
Chairman, Lu Zhengxiang sent a telegram.

446
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,760
Read!

447
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
Please help me, Brother Botang.

448
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
Shameless bastard Xu Shichang!

449
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,360
Shameless bastard Duan Qirui!

450
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Shameless bastard Qian Nengxun!

451
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,920
You send a telegram to Lu Zhengxiang immediately.

452
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
He wants me to save him,

453
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
then he must remember my words.

454
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,120
This treaty can never be signed.

455
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,680
If he signs it,

456
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440
he will, for sure,

457
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,120
be an unforgivable sinner of the Chinese nation, carved in history.

458
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,800
I need a car!

459
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm going to meet Cai Juemin

460
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,920
You two go there.

461
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,640
You, there.

462
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,280
Got it!

463
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:24,911
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

464
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,440
Mr. Cai.

465
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,120
Chairman Wang has arrived.

466
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Please come in.

467
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,680
Yes.

468
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,040
Jiemin.

469
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,720
Brother Botang.

470
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
This is devastating.

471
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,360
If we don't do something,

472
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
we will not be able to face the future generations.

473
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,080
Brother Botang.

474
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,520
How come?

475
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,360
Xu Shichang and Duan Qirui.

476
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,720
These two shamless liars.

477
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
They have sent a telegram to Paris today

478
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,360
to sign the Paris Peace Treaty.

479
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,880
Lu Zhengxiang signed it already?

480
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,520
Not yet.

481
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,560
He sent me a telegram just now asking me to save him.

482
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
I can't save him.

483
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
I can't save Shandong.

484
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,040
Now it's up to the students.

485
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,760
Brother Botang, tell me.

486
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,160
I am only a scholar. What can I do?

487
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,120
You can

488
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
You, Cai Jiemin have Peking University to back you.

489
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,080
Peking University has China to back it.

490
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,200
When 400 million Chinese people stand together for one goal,

491
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
then China will not die.

492
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
Thank you for your advice.

493
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,960
Yuanpei knows what to do.

494
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
The reason why I called everyone together urgently,

495
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
is to discuss a serious matter,

496
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,400
with everyone here.

497
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,200
The Beiyang government has sent a telegram to the delegation in Paris

498
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
to sign the Paris Peace Treaty,

499
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
officially handing over Shandong to Japan.

500
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
It is happening.

501
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
That's treason!

502
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
Mr. Cai, we can't stand by and watch.

503
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,040
We all know that.

504
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
Patriotism is what Peking University believes in.

505
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
The nation is facing a matter of life and death.

506
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
We will not just stand by and watch.

507
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,000
I told Wang Daxie just now,

508
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
this country is at the edge of a cliff.

509
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
I, Cai Yuanpei, will go to hell to save it,

510
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,640
even if no one else will follow.

511
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
Mr. Cai, I will go to hell with you.

512
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,480
Every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation.

513
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
Our country is in trouble,

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,120
I will go to hell with you.

515
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,800
Going to hell won't help right now.

516
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,880
I have thought about this for a long time.

517
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
It was an article by Shouchang that inspired me.

518
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,880
He mentioned the Russian October Revolution,

519
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,240
it's a victory for the common people.

520
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,160
Those people in Russia used violence to win.

521
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
What about us Chinese?

522
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,280
Can we use democracy?

523
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:42,071
[Lu Xun, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]
[Liu Bannong, Professor at Peking University]

524
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,960
Worth trying.

525
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
Our country is the people's country.

526
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,840
The people have the final say in this country's fate.

527
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,000
Now Beiyang government went against public opinion

528
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,520
and sold out the sovereignty of our country.

529
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,480
What should we do?

530
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,160
I say there is no other way.

531
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
The only solution is to be practised by the people.

532
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
How can people stand up and solve it then?

533
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,240
No more sitting back and watching.

534
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,000
We, Peking University, need to be the pioneers in this.

535
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
It's time for people to wake up and take the power.

536
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
Let's also give the government a subaltern victory.

537
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,720
Mr. Cai.

538
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
Deng Zhongxia and other are organizing the Beijing Students Union.

539
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
I urged them to act quickly.

540
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,120
This operation should not only involving students.

541
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
Workers, merchants and soldiers,

542
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,560
All strata should take action.

543
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
The whole society stand together,

544
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
that is the action of the common people.

545
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
Only that can force the reactionary government to give in.

546
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
I agree with Zhongfu and Shouchang.

547
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,720
If Peking University can take the lead,

548
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
pushing people from all over the country to unite,

549
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
that will be the beginning of a brand-new history.

550
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
Yes, you are influential among young people.

551
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,680
They will listen.

552
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,280
Zhongfu said just now.

553
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,760
Let the people stand up and take action.

554
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,160
I think this sentence should be our slogan.

555
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,160
Shout this slogan out.

556
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,560
A call to arms.

557
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
You two once said

558
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,720
that we should talk about politics directly and openly.

559
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
I had doubts and reservations at that time.

560
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,840
Now it seems like,

561
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
you are the ones have foresight.

562
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,720
But it's hard to cover every aspects if we move in haste.

563
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,440
Mr. Cai.

564
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
I know what you mean.

565
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,040
I'm going to Changxindian now.

566
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,640
Tell our worker brothers

567
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,840
the result of the Paris Peace Conference.

568
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,160
Go.

569
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,280
Mr. Shouchang.

570
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,040
Be careful.

571
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,600
Yucai, come.

572
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,520
Let's work it out,

573
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,280
how to carry out this operation.

574
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,920
What steps and actions should we take.

575
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,600
Mr. Cai.

576
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,200
Mr. Cai.

577
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,520
Mr. Cai.

578
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,160
Please sit down, teachers and students.

579
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,040
Today, I summoned teachers and student representatives together in a hurry.

580
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,200
I had to,

581
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
because this is urgent matter.

582
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
The Paris Peace Conference has now adopted

583
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
this unfair treaty.

584
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,360
The content of this treaty

585
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,600
is to remove all the rights

586
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,920
of the defeated Germany,

587
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,520
and to hand it over to Japan.

588
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,440
Everyone knows that

589
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,720
we attended this Paris Conference as a victorious country.

590
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,040
In this conference,

591
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,800
as a defeated country,

592
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
Germany

593
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,320
should return

594
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,080
occupied Shandong to China

595
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,840
and give up all its rights.

596
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
On the contrary, at this peace meeting,

597
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,120
the big powers ignored China.

598
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,120
They even openly came out with a shameless agreement.

599
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,160
This unfair Paris Peace Treaty.

600
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
Our government

601
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,800
has already sent messages to the Chinese delegation in Paris.

602
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Asked them to

603
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
sign this shameful peace treaty.

604
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,520
We all know,

605
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,200
the second they sign this humiliating treaty,

606
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,360
our Shandong

607
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,560
will go under Japan's control.

608
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,480
All students.

609
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,280
Can we, as a Chinese,

610
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
let this happen?

611
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,520
No way!

612
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,920
I came to Peking University three years ago.

613
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,000
I came with a dream in my heart.

614
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,680
To lead and push Peking University.

615
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,680
To make it an extraordinary insititute for education.

616
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,480
A university like that,

617
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,560
it has patriotism written in it's heart.

618
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,640
To love one's country.

619
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,120
In my opinion.

620
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,560
Patriotism is in future the soul and tradition

621
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,320
of our Peking University.

622
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
We study in Peking University,

623
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
not to be an authority,

624
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,040
but to contribute to this country

625
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,760
and be a pillar of this country.

626
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
Now our country has arrived

627
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,200
a critical moment of survival.

628
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
Each and every one of our students

629
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
should step forward

630
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,480
and be a pioneer in saving this country.

631
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,960
We need to call out to the people,

632
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
and urge the government

633
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,960
to refuse to sign this unfair Paris Peace Treaty

634
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
to defend our sovereignty.

635
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,040
My students and teachers.

636
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,240
Let me ask you,

637
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,480
do you have the courage and strength?

638
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,320
We do!

639
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,000
Defend sovereignty, no signing the treaty!

640
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,000
Defend sovereignty, no signing the treaty!

641
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
Defend sovereignty, no signing the treaty!

642
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,440
Defend sovereignty, no signing the treaty!

643
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,680
We need people gather here at this intersection.

644
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Otherwise, we can't have a big enough crowds, understand?

645
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,000
What if we can't get enough?

646
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,280
How about here, here, here, here.

647
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:41,840
Here?

648
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,600
How can there be not enough people, it's such a small intersection?

649
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
Sir, Brother Ge and more are here.

650
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,880
Mr. Dazhao.

651
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,600
Shugui.

652
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,400
Mr. Dazhao.

653
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm grateful to all the workers here for your support.

654
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,560
Thank you.

655
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,280
Mr. Dazhao

656
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
We workers also want to help our country

657
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,240
and do something.

658
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,760
Anything you need,

659
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,800
just tell us.

660
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,400
All right, everybody, have a seat.

661
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,680
Let's sit and talk.

662
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:01,920
Good.

663
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,360
Shugui.

664
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,280
So here is the thing.

665
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,280
Our lecture group on civilian education

666
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
has set a speech route.

667
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,000
It's marked on the map.

668
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,440
I want you to do me a favor.

669
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,360
Look at which block has the most workmates.

670
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,480
We'll go there first.

671
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,320
I see.

672
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,400
I think this place here

673
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
is where you can find the most workers.

674
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,560
Write it down.

675
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:24,800
Okay.

676
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,920
And Mr. Dazhao,

677
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,560
I want to

678
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
arrange some workmates

679
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
to keep everything under order with our students.

680
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,440
Students.

681
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,880
Not long ago,

682
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,800
the Paris Peace Conference has passed one agreement.

683
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,160
An unfair treaty

684
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
that our Shandong will be handed over to Japan.

685
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
The moment we sign on this treaty,

686
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,280
Shandong will no longer be ours.

687
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,240
Students.

688
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
Can we let this happen?

689
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,560
Never!

690
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,920
No way!

691
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,960
Exactly, we won't.

692
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
Look at the uniforms you are wearing.

693
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,840
Look at the emblem of Peking University we are wearing.

694
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,600
Peking University takes patriotism as its soul and tradition.

695
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,000
At the critical time of our country's survival,

696
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
can we show the world our courage and responsibility?

697
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:58,880
Yes!

698
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,600
Yeah!

699
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,520
Does anyone want to say something？

700
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,640
Do you have anything to add?

701
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,920
No.

702
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,000
We should spread the words out to other students.

703
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay, that's settled then.

704
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,440
May 3rd in the auditorium of Peking University Third Hall.

705
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,960
A meeting for all students will be held.

706
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,720
Not only Peking University students,

707
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,480
more than a dozen other schools should be involved,

708
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
we need them to send a representative to attend.

709
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,800
Any questions?

710
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,320
No

711
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,840
Then please, everyone.

712
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,120
Take action.

713
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,320
Fellow students.

714
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,240
Here, I declare

715
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,720
the resolution of Beijing Association of Schools.

716
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,200
Firstly, we will unite all classes to strive and to fight.

717
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
Secondly, the nation humiliation demonstration scheduled for May 7th

718
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
will now be moved forward to May 4th.

719
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:37,680
Thirdly,

720
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,720
send messages to the emissary in Paris, no signing.

721
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:41,840
Fourthly,

722
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,600
inform all the provinces,

723
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,880
on May 7th

724
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,240
we are all holding patriotic demonstrations.

725
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,440
Good.

726
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,640
Fellow students.

727
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,560
By the decision of the preparatory group of Student Union.

728
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,880
We recommend Fu Sinian

729
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
as the commander-in-chief of tomorrow's demonstration.

730
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,360
Luo Jialun and ten more others

731
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,160
as the general representative of tomorrow's demonstration.

732
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,200
Please cheer for them.

733
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,480
Yeah.

734
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,960
Finally, the route map for demonstration tomorrow

735
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,480
will be posted at the entrance of the auditorium.

736
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,440
Please, all school representatives, be sure to read carefully.

737
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,320
So you can make arrangement and implementation at your school as soon as possible.

738
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,160
Students!

739
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,400
Down with the traitor, give us back Qingdao!

740
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,360
Down with the traitor, give us back Qingdao!

741
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,680
Down with the traitor, give us back Qingdao!

742
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,320
Down with the traitor, give us back Qingdao!

743
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,200
On May 4th, 1919,

744
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,720
From Peking University, Beijing Normal University

745
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
along with thirteen colleges and technical secondary schools,

746
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,920
more than three thousand students

747
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,160
gathered at Tiananmen.

748
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,680
They made their voices heard

749
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,640
to fight for the nation's sovereignty, and punish the nation's traitors,

750
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
calling for the abolition of the Twenty-One Demands,

751
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
and demanding the rejection of the Paris Peace Treaty,

752
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,680
holding three pro-Japanese officials in the Beiyang government accountable:

753
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,520
Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang,

754
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,720
and Lu Zongyu.

755
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,720
The demonstration was blocked

756
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,520
after they started protesting in the embassy district of Dongjiaominxiang.

757
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,160
They turned to Cao Rulin's residence in Zhaojialou Hutong instead,

758
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,960
beating up the traitor Zhang Zongxiang

759
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
and setting Cao's residence on fire.

760
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
The Beiyang government quickly arrested Xu Deheng

761
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,960
and thirty-two students.

762
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,480
On May 5th,

763
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
Beijing universities and colleges announced

764
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,320
a strike and called all parties to ask for support.

765
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
The patriotic movement of students in Beijing

766
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,960
quickly spread throughout the country.

767
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,560
The May Fourth Movement

768
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,920
was a campaign pioneered by bright young intellectuals,

769
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,080
participated by people from all walks of life,

770
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,400
in a great anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, patriotic, revolutionary movement.

771
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,040
It was a great social revolutionary movement launched by the Chinese people,

772
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,240
to save the nation from subjugation, to safeguard national dignity

773
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,960
and to unite national strength.

774
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,640
It was a great intellectual enlightenment movement

775
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,440
and new culture movement that spread new ideas,

776
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,360
new culture and new thinking.

777
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
The huge wave from this movement

778
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,760
inspired the Chinese people and the Chinese nation

779
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,400
the confidence to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

780
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,960
The May Fourth Movement,

781
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,400
with its revolutionary pursuit of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism,

782
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
was progressive in the truth of saving the country and strengthening the country,

783
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,040
and the extensive participation

784
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,200
of peoples and ethnic groups from all walks of life

785
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
promoted China's social progress.

786
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,440
It promoted the spread of Marxism in China.

787
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,440
It promoted the integration of Marxism

788
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,920
with the Chinese workers' movement.

789
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,480
It laid the foundation for the establishment of the Communist Party of China,

790
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,760
not only ideologically,

791
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,120
but also in the preparation of party cadres.

792
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,120
It provided the conditions for new revolutionary forces, revolutionary culture, and revolutionary struggle

793
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
to step onto the stage of history.

794
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,200
It is a turning point where China's old democratic revolution

795
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,920
marches towards the new democratic revolution.

796
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,600
In modern times,

797
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,960
it marks a milestone in the historical process of the Chinese nation's pursuit

798
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,760
for national independence,

799
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,240
and the country's development and progress.

800
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,960
Down with the traitor Cao Rulin!

801
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,480
Down with the traitor Zhang Zongxiang！

802
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Down with the traitor Lu Zongyu!

803
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
Down with the traitor Zhang Zongxiang!

804
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,360
Love our country! Defend our country!

805
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,320
Down with the traitor Zhang Zongxiang!

806
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
Guo, are you alright?

807
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,080
Is Guo okay?

808
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,520
Take him to the hospital now.

809
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,680
Hurry!

810
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,640
Guo!

811
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,520
Hang in there.

812
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,320
Guo!

813
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Defend our country!

814
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
We have to arrest these students.

815
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Students' disturbances must be severely punished.

816
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,880
Use the police when necessary.

817
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,000
Right.

818
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,360
Arrest them.

819
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,320
Let me tell you something, these students-

820
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,200
Premier Qian is here.

821
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
I gathered everyone this late at night.

822
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,880
It's for urgent matter. Please sit down.

823
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,600
Today, students from Peking University

824
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,520
and others from more than a dozen schools marched in the streets.

825
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,040
They also burned Zhaojialou.

826
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm sure you all already know.

827
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,120
President Xu is very angry about this matter,

828
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,600
asking our cabinet to come up with a plan immediately.

829
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,600
In case things get worse,

830
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,280
Marshal Duan also called

831
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,920
to strictly control the troubled students.

832
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,720
Now, please let Nine Gates Infantry Commander Li Changtai

833
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
present an introduction to the situation.

834
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,720
Members of the cabinet.

835
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,720
This task of introducing the situation,

836
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,040
it should be Wu Bingxiang of the Metropolitan Police Department.

837
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,366
[Li Changtai, Nine Gates Infantry Commander]

838
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Wu Bingxiang, this old prick, dare not come.

839
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,040
So, allow me to take over.

840
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,200
Things are like this,

841
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,280
From 1:00 this afternoon,

842
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,040
more than 3,000 students from more than a dozen schools in Beijing

843
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,880
started a demonstration on the streets.

844
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,320
This student nonsense

845
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
is particularly serious in nature.

846
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,680
The influence is very bad.

847
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,560
President Xu Shichang has given the order

848
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,840
to ban the demonstration immediately

849
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,840
and stop students from making trouble.

850
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,440
He also asked the cabinet

851
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,840
to make a rapid action plan

852
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,800
and prevent something worse from happening tomorrow.

853
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,320
Commander Li

854
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
has made it clear.

855
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,880
Let's discuss.

856
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
They must be arrested.

857
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,200
Repress them!

858
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,880
Passers-by made the secene worse.

859
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,120
It's no good arresting them.

860
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,560
Here's my view on this.

861
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,600
Students are troublesome indeed,

862
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,960
but what's even worse is those behind it.

863
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,160
Cai Yuanpei, President of Peking University,

864
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,080
and several backbones around him

865
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,320
like Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao.

866
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
They are the culprits.

867
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,480
Should be severely punished.

868
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,440
This Cai Heqing has done nothing good

869
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,640
since he was in charge of Peking University.

870
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,360
In my opinion, he must be dismissed.

871
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
I would like to remind you that

872
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,360
what caused this student demonstration

873
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,440
was the humiliating Paris Peace Treaty.

874
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,280
Cai Yuanpei

875
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,160
is the first education chief of the Republic of China.

876
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,160
Since he took charge of Peking University,

877
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,520
he has won people's favor through a serious of measures.

878
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,720
If he leaves Peking University,

879
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,280
it is bound to lead to greater public grievances.

880
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
The consequences would be unthinkable.

881
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,840
Those people from the Ministry of Education and Cai Yuanpei,

882
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
they are all on the same side.

883
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,200
This mess the students made

884
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,800
is the result of your appeasement.

885
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,200
This Cai Yuanpei must leave.

886
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,040
He must be removed.

887
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,080
Gentlemen.

888
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,640
I think,

889
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,920
Fu, Minister of Education, is thinking too much about this.

890
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,960
You said Cai Yuanpei's position is unshakable.

891
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
What if Cai Yuanpei dies?

892
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,800
Will Peking University shut down?

893
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,160
Premier.

894
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,200
But then,

895
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,360
what we discuss today

896
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,680
is not about removing Cai Yuanpei,

897
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,680
but how to prevent worse situation from happening.

898
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,760
Fundamentally speaking, this matter

899
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,680
is the responsiblity of the Ministry of Education

900
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,360
But we are the Republic of China.

901
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,520
There are laws and regulations.

902
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,800
It's the students' affairs.

903
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,640
Of course, it's up to the Ministry of Education.

904
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,080
Public security matters,

905
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
of course, is the responsibility of the police department.

906
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
The Nine Gates Infantry Commander should take care of military affairs.

907
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
You'd better stay out of this.

908
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,840
So as not to make things getting serious.

909
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,840
I heard that the students who were caught

910
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,480
they are still locked up in the army's jail.

911
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,320
That's against regulations.

912
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,160
So, inform Wu Bingxiang.

913
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,800
Tell him to immediately take the captured students

914
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,320
and move them to the police station.

915
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
How interesting.

916
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,400
I worked all day long on this.

917
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
Turns out what I did is wrong.

918
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,200
Fine, I will walk.

919
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,120
I'm meeting Marshal Duan. I'll reason with him.

920
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,720
Li!

921
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,080
Don't go!

922
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,080
Don't go!

923
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,160
Li!

924
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,720
Don't go. You can't go

925
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,640
Please sit down, everyone.

926
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,240
I discussed it with President Xu.

927
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,760
To deal with this matter,

928
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,600
we have to be tough in the action.

929
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,040
But be gentle in the words.

930
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,000
The goal is not to make things worse.

931
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,800
The most important thing right now is May 7th.

932
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
The National Convention held in Central Park.

933
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,080
In any case, they cannot be allowed to hold this conference.

934
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,560
This National Convention can't lead to anything good.

935
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,360
We can't even start to imagine the outcome.

936
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
Students.

937
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,320
According to the information from each school,

938
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,920
it has been found out

939
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,320
that a total of 32 students have been arrested.

940
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,240
Twenty students from Peking University.

941
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,760
Eight people from Beijing Normal University.

942
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,520
Two people from other specialised schools.

943
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,680
One from Huiwen University and one from University of China.

944
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,400
These students now

945
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,400
are in the jail under amry department.

946
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,720
Xu Deheng and other students from Peking University

947
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,040
are locked up in station cages as felons,

948
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,400
humiliated and tortured.

949
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,400
Word is that

950
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,840
reactionary warlord Duan Qirui

951
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,360
aims at revenge for the traitor Cao Rulin.

952
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,160
He gave orders to severely punish the arrested students.

953
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,480
Their lives are in danger now.

954
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,160
The situation is not optimistic.

955
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,480
We must not stand by and watch.

956
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,240
We will not!

957
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,080
Never!

958
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,800
Never!

959
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,840
Watch from the sidelines!

960
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,680
We must not stand by and watch!

961
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,800
Please be quiet.

962
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,640
Quiet please.

963
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,880
Mr. Cai has arrived.
