Xingang

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,080
Xingang, what's wrong with you.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Xingang, say something, please.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,560
You are frightening me.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,840
Xingang, Xingang, say something

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
Don't scare me.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,680
this

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,600
What happened to your hair?

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,680

Xingang

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,960
Xingang, say something. 

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,520
Let's go.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,600
Come on, Xingang, let's not stay here.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,400
go

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,440
Let's go.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
Come and get up.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,240
Come

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,240
Let's go find Mr. Zhongfu. Let's go.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
Let's go find Mr. Zhongfu.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,640
Xingang

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Brother Zhongfu writes well.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
Every sentence hit my heart.

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
If we want to really change a country,

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,680
We can't do it alone.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,640
Exactly

39
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,760
Zhongfu

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,440
Zhongfu

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,320
Mr. Zhongfu

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,720
Come in

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,240
What's the matter here? 

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Xingang is sick.

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,280
Why is your hair all white? 

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
What happened?

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,880
Xingang, he was stimulated by the Paris Peace Conference.

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,840
He was utterly frustrated.

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,000
Sat by the river in the wild all night.

50
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,400
It's probably a cold.

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
Caused him passing out. 

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm gonna make him some brown sugar water. 

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,440
Right away.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
XingangXingang

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,200
you

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,720
Why you have to bear all those in your mind?

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,360
Tell us what's the problem.

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,960
We can work together.

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,720
Sir

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
Sir, I'm fine.

61
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,440
I just haven't been able to sleep these days.

62
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,000
I can see my father as soon as I close my eyes.

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560


64
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,720
My father

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
He was the General Commander of Dengzhou in Qing Dynasty.

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,040
Under Gaoyuan Zhang's administration.

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
In 1897

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,360
German East Asia Fleet Commander

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
Dietrich attacked Qingdao.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,520
My father was in Jimo County.

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,960
He fought against them.

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,520
Later, he was dismissed and returned home.

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
It wasn't long before my father died of illness.

74
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
Before he passed away,

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
He called me to his side and told me.

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,040
Xingang, the lost of Qingdao was on me. 

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,320
When we have Qingdao back one day,

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,800
You must tell me.

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,760
Sir, Xingang just doesn't understand.

80
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Didn't we win?

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
Germany defeated

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Qingdao should be returned to us.

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,800
I wanted to tell my father at his grave.

84
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,080
Father,

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
Qingdao is back now.

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,800
Qingdao is back.

87
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
But now what's going on?

88
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
The last thing my father said before he left was

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
Lu You's poem "Shi Er"

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
That after death everything becomes void, I surely perceive.

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,840
Yet, not to have seen my country unified is still what makes me grieve.

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,200
The day comes when our troops take back the old land.

93
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,400
Forget not to tell me when you remember me at my grave.

94
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,120
Xingang, being sad can't help right now.

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
You must have stayed up the whole night.

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
I also had a sleepless night.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
I wrote three articles.

98
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,800
Bai Lan, read this for everyone.

99
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
Paris peace conference

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,040
All countries focus on their own interests.

101
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
What justice? What permanent peace?

102
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,960
What's President Wilson's Fourteen Declarations?

103
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
All has become a worthless empty talk.

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,920
France, Italy and Japan are three militaristic countries.

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Because it didn't meet with their desire to invade other land.

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
They threw a tantrum, put on a show and threatened to quit the peace meeting.

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
I say this meeting is all about share the spoils. 

108
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Was it about permanent peace with the world?

109
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
True happiness of mankind?

110
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,000
It's thousands of miles apart.

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960


112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
It has to be people all over the world stand together,

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
that this can be solved directly.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
If you count on this share dividing meeting

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,760
Those politicians and diplomats

116
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
All they do is keep the door shut and play it dirty.

117
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
There can't be fair outcomes.

118
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,240
Sir, you mean

119
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
that we cannot rely on others,

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
that we people must stand up,

121
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
and do it ourselves.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Yes, you are right.

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840
Xingang, we are at this point already. 

124
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
At this time,

125
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,320
it's no use being sad.

126
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
The imperialist government is unreliable.

127
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
China's feudal government is also unreliable.

128
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
What is reliable then?

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
Ourselves

130
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,200
At time like this.

131
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,440
We have to and should stand up.

132
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
With our own strength.

133
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
Save our own country. 

134
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
Sir, tell us.

135
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,560
What should we do now?

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,440
Go into action

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Resolutely resist that shameless peace treaty

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,720
We will never let the Beiyang government

139
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
sign that ridiculous peace treaty.

140
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,840
We must fight like your father.

141
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
You have to believe,

142
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,560
through our efforts,

143
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,000
your father's last wish，

144
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
It will come true one day.

145
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,080
Sir.

146
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
I follow you.

147
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,640
Gentlemen, I'll follow you too.

148
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,720
Good.

149
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Xingang, now drink the brown sugar water.

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,640
The President arrived.

151
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,280


152
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,360


153
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
Bo Tang, I heard that

154
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
The opinions of your foreign affairs committee have come out. 

155
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,160
Tell me about it.

156
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,360
Lu Zhengxiang is sending several telegrams in one day, asking for it.

157
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,920
So, everyone signed this, that's serious.

158
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,400
Sit down.

159
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,920
We are under the pressure of being called traitor,

160
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,200
Dare not handle this without certain seriousness

161
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
Tell me more.

162
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,840
At the end of the day, it's just two words, no signing.  

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,120
Refuse to sign.

164
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,720
Is it easy to say, have you considered the consequences?

165
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
We discussed it for two days.

166
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
All the consequences have been considered.

167
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,800
But a telegram from Lu Zhengxiang said

168
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
If we don't sign the peace treaty

169
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
At least Japan, Britain, France and Italy,

170
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
these four countries

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,160
will challenge us.

172
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,360
If that happens,

173
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,400
what we lost,

174
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,040
it's not just Germany's rights and interests in Shandong, 

175
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
but the rights and interests of the whole country.

176
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,400
That kind of loss is too big.

177
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
We might be the country won the war,

178
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,360
but we would end up with nothing.

179
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
Have you considered this?

180
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Lu Zhengxiang has never

181
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
told me about this problem.

182
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
But he's telling me that every day.

183
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
What does Lu Zhengxiang want?

184
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,200
It's very clear.

185
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
He thinks we should sign the treaty.

186
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
So as not to lose big over small issue.

187
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,120
Lu Zhengxiang cannot see the bigger picture and not following his order.

188
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
He should be held accountable just for suggesting put this country and its people into disaster.

189
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,160


190
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
Botang, what are you talking about now.

191
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
Isn't this a discussion?

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,440
Calm down.

193
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,720
President Xu

194
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,200
Premier Qian

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
Open your eyes.

196
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
If Republic of China, 

197
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
if this government signs this peace treaty,

198
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
do you dare to step out of the gate of the Presidential Palaceever again? 

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,000
Brother Botang

200
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,920
That sounds almost horrifying.

201
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
Now I need you to answer Lu Zhengxiang's question. 

202
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
Sign and not sign

203
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Which option

204
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,520
will lead to greater loss of this country's interests?

205
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,400
Lu Zhengxiang is simply a worrywart.

206
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,280
He's talking nonsense.

207
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,200
All the spearheads of the Paris Peace Conference

208
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
they all aim at Germany.

209
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,160
The Versailles system will tear Germany to pieces.

210
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
How can Germany then bargain with China?

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,960
Anyone with diplomatic common sense 

212
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,640
will not raise this kind of question.

213
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:17,840
Sit.

214
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
According to what you say,

215
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,160
Lu Zhengxiang is worrying too much.

216
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,080
This is not a problem at all. 

217
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,640
Premier Qian

218
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,080
I

219
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
I really want to hear your opinion.

220
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,680
I

221
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:35,840


222
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
I will listen to the president. 

223
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,200


224
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,680
Sit down

225
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,720
Acting Chief Chen, what's your opinion?

226
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
I am a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
I already signed the message of refusal.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,560
President.

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,240
This is what we have drawn up.

230
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
A Telegram to the Chinese delegation, refusal to sign.

231
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,560
Please take a look, President.

232
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
What's your opinion?

233
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
Refuse to sign

234
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
Since everyone agrees we should not sign.

235
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Then please Premier Qian,

236
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
send it in the name of the State Council.

237
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
But this matter must be kept secret.

238
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
The young people can't know.

239
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
Yes, President.

240
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
You go to the telecommunications office right now.

241
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,360
Send a telegram to Lu Zhengxiang immediately.

242
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,320
It's still dark in Paris.

243
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,680
Right now

244
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,280
I want to lambaste Lu Zhengxiang.

245
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,640
This treacherous clown.

246
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
Why does he advocate for signing the treaty?

247
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
You don't need to send a telegram for that matter.

248
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,520
I can tell you the truth.

249
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,120
What truth?

250
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,240
So,

251
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,320
Lu Zhengxiang never once said he agree to sign the treaty.

252
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
Duan Qirui asked him to analyze the current situation.

253
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
How Europe and America, including Germany

254
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,440
how will they react to the Shandong issue.

255
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
In Lu Zhengxiang's long analysis report,

256
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
there's one paragraph about Germany.

257
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,120
Duan Qirui, underlined that alone.

258
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
and commented with eight words.

259
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,320
Not worthy losing even more over small matter.

260
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
Cao Rulin presented that to Xu Shichang,

261
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
said that Lu Zhengxiang's attitude

262
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
is that we should sign the treaty for the long-term benefit.

263
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,880
How do you know all those details?

264
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,040
Lin Changmin came just now.

265
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,320
You were not here.

266
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
He asked me to tell you all those.

267
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,880
I see.

268
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,760
No wonder Xu Shichang behaved weirdly.

269
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
He wanted to use me as an excuse to cope Duan Qirui.

270
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,520
This old fox.

271
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,680
Did Xu Shichang agree to the refusal message?

272
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,080


273
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
Barely, but he did.

274
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
He has asked Qian Nengxun, in the name of the State Council,

275
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
issue a telegram to convey the refusal.

276
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,920
Great

277
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,080
Now you can have a good sleep. 

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm still not at ease. 

279
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
Go to the telecommunications office immediately.

280
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,480
In my name

281
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
Send an urgent telegram to Lu Zhengxiang.

282
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
Take note of the telegram.

283
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
Stupid one might be,

284
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,600
One shall not make the same mistake again.

285
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Chinese people will not allow the second Li Hongzhang.

286
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,520
Indeed.

287
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,040
I'll send it right away

288
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,960
Tell him to respond as soon as possible.

289
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,200
good

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Shiyan, do you need more glue there?

291
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,600
Yeah, after I done with this one.

292
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,000
good

293
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,640
come

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,640
Classmates

295
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,640
Mr. Shouchang, Mr. Shouchang

296
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,840
Yes, sir. Hello, sir

297
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,520
Let me tell you three things.

298
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,960
First.

299
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
Wang Daxie called Mr Cai.

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
Said the national government had sent out a fax,

301
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
to the Chinese delegation in Paris,

302
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
about the refusal to sign the peace treaty.

303
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,920
good

304
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
Second thing is,

305
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
National diplomatic association

306
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,360
sent a notice.

307
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,880
It is scheduled for May 7th.

308
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,840
The National Convention in Central Park.

309
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,600
We are to boycott the Paris Peace Treaty.

310
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,040
Peking University

311
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,800
along with students from other schools.

312
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,080
We will be the main force in this conference.

313
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,360
And the third is that,

314
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
the whole country has taken action.

315
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
Especially Shandong.

316
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,960
Shanghai

317
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,840
Guangzhou

318
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,840
Through different approaches

319
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,800


320
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,920
all started boycott movement.

321
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,160
Thanks to the New Culture Movement.

322
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,640
It set up two flags of science and democracy.

323
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,120
So we can break the old world,

324
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,800
and get to witness this new one.

325
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,720
I remember Mr. Zhongfu

326
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,400
once said this,

327
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,520
that he would not talk about politics for twenty years. 

328
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,920
He shall only concentrate on enlightenment.

329
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
Well, now he realized

330
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,640
that he was biased back then.

331
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Given the fact that science and democracy,

332
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
they are inseparable from politics itself.

333
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,360
Democracy itself is politics. 

334
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
If we want to talk about science and democracy,

335
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,880
then politics will come knocking at the door.

336
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,320
No hide from it.

337
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,920
Think about it, everybody.

338
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
Everything happened in Peking University in the last three years.

339
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,400
Which one was not related to politics?

340
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,720
I have a question for all of you.

341
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,960
What is democracy?

342
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Democracy means that the people are the masters of their country.

343
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
Xingang is right

344
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,840
China belongs to the people.

345
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
So of course it is the people take responsibility for it.

346
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,000
The people shall make decisions.

347
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
This is the proper meaning of the country.

348
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,520
But the Republic of China has been around for eight years.

349
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,280
I want to ask everyone

350
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,560
Was there even one thing,

351
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
that we got the power to decide.

352
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,320
None.

353
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,680
right

354
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
Last year, Duan Qirui 

355
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,120
He signed a secret agreement with Japan.

356
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,880
Did he ask for people's opinions?

357
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,160
No.

358
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
Even the Chinese Emissary

359
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
didn't know about such a thing.

360
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,480
A total liar.

361
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,920
People was deceived.

362
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
People was fooled.

363
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
So I said

364
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
This Paris peace conference is bad indeed.

365
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,000
However, there is another way to look like it.

366
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,440
There can be a good aspect.

367
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
How so?

368
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
Because of this Paris Peace Conference

369
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,280
Chinese are all awake now.

370
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
If China wants to develop,

371
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,360
opposition to feudalism and leading new culture is not enough.

372
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,880
We also need to stand out,

373
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,640
fight against imperialism,

374
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,960
defend our own sovereignty.

375
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
To achieve these,

376
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
we have to wake people up.

377
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,320
Only when the people wake up can China have hope.

378
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,560
So, my fellow students.

379
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
Our lecture group on civilian education

380
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,200
needs to get close to the grassroots as soon as possible.

381
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Go into the factory.

382
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
Go into the fields.

383
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,360
All of our groups

384
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
needs to reach out to every corner of society.

385
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,960
To awaken the people.

386
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,160
What do you think?

387
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,120
sir

388
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,120
We are now working on establish a union.

389
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,440
A student union for all tertiary education insititutes in Beijing.

390
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
We will connect all the schools,

391
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
make it easier for organizing large-scale activities.

392
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,480
Our public education lecture group

393
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,920
will be divided into four smaller teams.

394
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,320
We are giving a series of speeches in Changxindian and other places respectively.

395
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,920
We are organizing a parade right now.

396
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
At the National Assembly on May 7th,

397
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
there will be a parade of 100,000 people.

398
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:36,880
Good

399
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,840
Good

400
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,880
Students

401
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
Let's act now.

402
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,800
Yes!

403
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,680
Dry up this.

404
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
Government has made it clear,

405
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
Lu Zhenxiang will refuse to sign the peace treaty.

406
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
So, for all the speech at this National Assembly

407
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
Be sure to pay attention to discretion.

408
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,200
There must be no voice to denounce the government. 

409
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,920
Chairman of the committee.

410
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,040
One important thing. 

411
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
That is, it can never appear

412
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
the voice of critcizing President Wilson.

413
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao from Peking University,

414
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,680
in the Weekly Review,

415
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,240
publicly accussed President Wilson being useless.

416
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
We cannot promote this kind of behavior.

417
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,200
Endangering the bigger picture.

418
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
We should target the Japanese,

419
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,880
and the pro-Japanese factions in China.

420
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,760
Cao Rulin,

421
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,720
Zhang Zongxiang,

422
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,520
and Lu Zongyu.

423
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,160
Chairman of the committee!

424
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,760
What is it?

425
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,360
Something bad.

426
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,680
Speak.

427
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,000
The State Council has secretly sent a message to Paris.

428
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,280
They agreed to sign the treaty!

429
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,160
Right, I need to go now.

430
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,200
How is that possible?

431
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,040
A guy from Lin Changmin's hometown works in the office.

432
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,240
He sent that telegram himself.

433
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
He told Lin Changmin secretly.

434
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,880
Source is solid.

435
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,000
Where is Lin Changmin now?

436
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll go find him. 

437
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
Lin Changmin just

438
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
handed Xu Shichang a resignation letter.

439
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,680
He asked me to bring you this note.

440
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,960
This government is treacherous.

441
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,520
I can never go along with it.

442
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,120
I am resigning too.

443
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
Chairman, at this time

444
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
You can't just walk away.

445
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,560
Chairman, Lu Zhengxiang sent a telegram .

446
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,760
Read!

447
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
Please help me, Brother BoTang. 

448
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
Shameless bustard Xu Shichang!

449
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,360
Shameless bustard Duan Qirui!

450
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Shameless bustard Qian Nengxun!

451
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,920
You send a telegram to Lu Zhengxiang immediately. 

452
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
He wants me to save him,

453
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
then he must remember my words.

454
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,120
This treaty can never be signed.

455
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,680
If he signs it,

456
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440
he will for sure,

457
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,120
be that unforgivable sinner of the Chinese nation, carved in history.

458
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,800
I need car.

459
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm going to meet Cai Juemin

460
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,920
You two go there.

461
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,640
You, there.

462
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,280
Yes.

463
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,440
Mr. Cai

464
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,120
Chairman Wang has arrived

465
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Please come in.

466
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,680
Yes.

467
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,040
Jueming.

468
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,720
Brother Botang

469
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
This is devastating.

470
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,360
If we don't do something,

471
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
we will not be able to face the future generations.

472
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,080
Brother Botang

473
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,520
How come?

474
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,360
Xu Shichang and Duan Qirui

475
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,720
These two shamless liar.

476
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
They have sent a telegram to Paris today. 

477
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,360
Agreed to sign the Paris Peace Treaty.

478
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,880
Lu Zhengxiang signed it already?

479
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,520
Not yet.

480
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,560
He sent me a telegram just now asking me to save him.

481
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
I can't save him.

482
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
I can't save Shandong.

483
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,040
Now it's up to the students.

484
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,760
Brother Botang, tell me.

485
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,160
I am only a scholar. What can I do?

486
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,120
You can

487
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
You, Cai Juemin have Peking University to back you.

488
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,080
Peking University has China to back it.

489
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,200
When millions of Chinese people stand together for one goal,

490
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
then China will not die.

491
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
Thank you for your advice.

492
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,960
Yuan Pei knows what to do.

493
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
The reason why I called everyone together urgently,

494
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
is to discuss a serious matter,

495
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,400
with everyone here.

496
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,200
The Beiyang government has sent a telegram to the delegation in Paris.

497
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
Agreed to sign the Paris Peace Treaty,

498
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
officially hand over Shandong to Japan. 

499
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
It is happening.

500
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
That's treason!

501
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
Mr Cai, we can't stand by and watch.

502
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,040
We all know that.

503
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
Patriotism is what Peking University believes in.

504
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
The nation is facing a matter of life and death,

505
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
We will not just stand by and watch.

506
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,000
I told Wang Daxie just now,

507
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
This country is at the edge of a cliff.

508
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
Me, Cai Yuanpei will go to hell to save it,

509
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,640
even if no one else will follow.

510
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
Mr Cai, I will go to hell with you.

511
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,480
Every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation.

512
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
Our country is in trouble,

513
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,120
I will go to hell with you.

514
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,800
Going to hell won't help right now.

515
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,880
I have thought about this for a long time.

516
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
It was an article by Shouchang that inspired me.

517
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,880
He mentioned the Russian October Revolution,

518
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,240
it's a victory for the common people.

519
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,160
Those people in Russia used violence to win.

520
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
What about us Chinese?

521
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,280
Can we use democracy?

522
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,960
Worth trying.

523
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
Our country is the people's country.

524
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,840
The people have the final say in this country's fate.

525
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,000
Now Beiyang government went against public opinion.

526
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,520
Sold out the sovereignty of our country. 

527
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,480
What should we do?

528
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,160
I say there is no other way.

529
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
The only solution is to be practised by the people.

530
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
How can people unit and solve it then?

531
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,240
No more sitting back and just watch.

532
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,000
We, this Peking University need to be the pioneers in this.

533
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
It's time for people to wake up and take the power. 

534
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
Let's also give the government a subaltern victory.

535
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,720
Mr. Cai

536
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
Deng Zhongxia, they are organizing the Beijing Students Union.

537
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
I urged them to act quickly.

538
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,120
This operation should not only involving students.

539
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
Workers, merchants and soldiers,

540
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,560
All strata should take action.

541
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
The whole society stand together,

542
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
that is the action of the common people.

543
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
Only that can force the reactionary government to give in.

544
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
I agree with Zhongfu and Shouchang.

545
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,720
If Peking University can take the lead,

546
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
pushing people from all over the country to unite, 

547
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
that will be the beginning of a brand-new history.

548
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
Yes, you are influential among young people.

549
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,680
They will listen.

550
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,280
Zhongfu said just now

551
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,760
Let the people stand up and take action.

552
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,160
I think this sentence should be our slogan.

553
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,160
Shout this slogan out.

554
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,560
A call to arms.

555
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
You two once said 

556
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,720
that we should talk about politics directly and openly.

557
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
I had doubts and reservations at that time.

558
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,840
Now it seems like,

559
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
You are the ones have foresight.

560
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,720
But it's hard to cover every aspects if we move in haste.

561
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,440
Mr. Cai

562
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
I know what you mean.

563
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,040
I'm going to Changxindian now.

564
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,640
Tell our worker brothers

565
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,840
the result of the Paris Peace Conference. 

566
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,160
Goo.

567
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,280
Mr. Shouchang

568
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,040
Be careful.

569
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,600
Yucai, come

570
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,520
Let's work it out,

571
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,280
how to carry out this operation.

572
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,920
What steps and actions should we take.

573
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,600
Mr. Cai

574
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,200
Mr. Cai

575
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,520
Mr. Cai

576
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,160
Please sit down, teachers and students.

577
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,040
Today, I summoned teachers and student representatives together in a hurry.

578
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,200
I had to.

579
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
Beacuse this is urgent matter.

580
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
The Paris Peace Conference has now adopted 

581
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
this unfair treaty.

582
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,360
The content of this treaty 

583
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,600
Is to remove all the rights 

584
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,920
of defeated Germany,

585
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,520
and to hand it over to Japan.

586
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,440
Everyone knows that

587
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,720
we attended this Paris Conference as the victorious country.

588
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,040
In this conference,

589
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,800
as a defeated one,

590
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
Germany.

591
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,320
It should

592
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,080
return occupied Shandong to China,

593
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,840
give up all rights.

594
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
On the contrary, at this peace meeting

595
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,120
big powers ignored China.

596
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,120
They even openly came out with a shameless agreement.

597
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,160
This unfair Paris Treaty.

598
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
Our government

599
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,800
has already sent messages to the Chinese delegation in Paris.

600
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Asked them to 

601
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
sign this shameful peace treaty.

602
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,520
We all know,

603
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,200
the second they sign this humiliating treaty,

604
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,360
Our Shandong

605
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,560
will go under Japan's control.

606
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,480
All students.

607
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,280
Can we, as a Chinses,

608
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
let this happen?

609
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,520
No way!

610
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,920
I came to Peking University three years ago.

611
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,000
I came with a dream in my heart.

612
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,680
To lead and push Peking University.

613
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,680
To make it an extraordinary insititute for education.

614
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,480
A university like that,

615
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,560
it has patriotism written in it's heart.

616
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,640
To love one's country.

617
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,120
In my opinion.

618
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,560
Patriotism is in future the soul and tradition

619
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,320
of our Peking University.

620
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
Studying in Peking University,

621
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
is not to be authority,

622
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,040
is to contribute to this country. 

623
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,760
Be a pillar of this country.

624
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
Now our country has arrived

625
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,200
a critical moment of survival.

626
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
Each and every one of our students

627
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
should step forward.

628
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,480
Be a pioneer in saving this country.

629
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,960
We need to call out to the people,

630
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
and urge the government,

631
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,960
refusing to sign this unfair Paris peace treaty.

632
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
Defend our sovereignty.

633
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,040
Students and teachers.

634
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,240
Let me ask you

635
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,480
Do you have the courage and strength?

636
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,320
We do!

637
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,000
Defend sovereignty, no signing the treaty. 

638
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,000
Defend sovereignty, no signing the treaty. 

639
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
Defend sovereignty, no signing the treaty. 

640
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,440
Defend sovereignty, no signing the treaty. 

641
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,680
We need people gather here at this intersection.

642
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Otherwise, we can't have a big enough crowds, understand?

643
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,000
What if we can't get enough?

644
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,280
How about here, here, here, here 

645
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:41,840
Here?

646
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,600
How can there be not enough people, it's such a small intersection?

647
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
Sir, Brother Ge and more are here

648
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,880
Mr. Dazhao

649
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,600
Shugui

650
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,400
Mr. Dazhao

651
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm grateful to all the workers here for your support.

652
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,560
thank you

653
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,280
Mr. Dazhao

654
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
Us workers also want to help our country.

655
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,240
To do something.

656
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,760
Anything you need,

657
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,800
just tell us.

658
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,400
All right, everybody, have a seat.

659
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,680
Let's sit and talk.

660
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:01,920
good

661
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,360
Shugui

662
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,280
So here is the thing.

663
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,280
Our lecture group on civilian education

664
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
has set a speech route.

665
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,000
It's marked on the map.

666
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,440
I want you to do me a favor. 

667
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,360
Look at which block has the most workmates.

668
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,480
We'll go there first.

669
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,320
I see.

670
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,400
I think this place here

671
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
is where you can find the most workers.

672
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,560
Write it down.

673
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:24,800
okay

674
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,920
And Mr. Dazhao.

675
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,560
I want to

676
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
arrange some workmates

677
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
to keep everything under order with our students.

678
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,440
Students.

679
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,880
Not long ago.

680
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,800
The Paris Peace Conference has passed one agreement.

681
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,160
An unfair treaty

682
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
that our Shandong will be handed over to Japan

683
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
The moment we sign on this treaty,

684
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,280
Shandong will no longer be ours.

685
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,240
Students.

686
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
Can we let this happen?

687
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,560
Never!

688
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,920
No way!

689
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,960
Exactly, we won't.

690
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
Look at the uniforms you are wearing.

691
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,840
Look at the emblem of Peking University we are wearing. 

692
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,600
Peking University takes patriotism as its soul and tradition.

693
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,000
At the critical time of our country's survival,

694
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
can we show the world our courage and responsibility?

695
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:58,880
Yes!

696
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,600
Yeah!

697
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,520
Does anyone want to say something？

698
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,640
Do you have anything to add? 

699
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,920
No

700
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,000
We should spread the words out to other students.

701
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay, that's settled then.

702
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,440
May 3rd in the auditorium of Peking University Third Hall.

703
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,960
A meeting for all students will be held.

704
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,720
Not only Peking University students,

705
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,480
more than a dozen other schools should be involved,

706
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
we need them to send a representative to attend.

707
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,800
Any questions?

708
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,320
No

709
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,840
Then please, everyone.

710
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,120
Take action

711
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,320
Fellow students.

712
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,240
Here, I declare

713
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,720
the resolution of Beijing Association of Schools.

714
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,200
Firstly, we will unite all classes to strive and to fight.

715
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
Secondly, the nation humiliation parade scheduled for May 7th 

716
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
will now be moved forward to May 4th.

717
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:37,680
Thirdly

718
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,720
Send messages to the emissary in Paris, no signing.

719
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:41,840
Fourthly

720
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,600
Inform all provinces,

721
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,880
On May 7th

722
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,240
we are all holding patriotic demonstrations.

723
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,440
good

724
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,640
Fellow students.

725
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,560
By the decision of the preparatory group of Student Union.

726
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,880
We recommend Fu Sinian

727
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
as the commander-in-chief of tomorrow's parade.

728
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,360
Luo Jialun and ten more others

729
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,160
as the general representative of tomorrow's parade.

730
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,200
Please cheer for them.

731
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,480
Yeah

732
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,960
Finally, the route map for parade tomorrow

733
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,480
will be posted at the entrance of the auditorium.

734
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,440
Please,all school representatives, be sure to read carefully.

735
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,320
So you can make arrangement and implementation at your school as soon as possible. 

736
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,160
Fellow students.

737
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,400
Down with the traitor, give us back Qingdao!

738
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,360
Down with the traitor, give us back Qingdao!

739
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,680
Down with the traitor, give us back Qingdao!

740
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,320
Down with the traitor, give us back Qingdao!

741
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,200
May 4th, 1919

742
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,720
Peking University, Peking teacher's college

743
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
along with thirteen colleges and technical secondary schools. 

744
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,920
More than three thousand students from these schools

745
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,160
gathered at Tiananmen for the parade.

746
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,680
They made their voices heard.

after they started protesting in the embassy district of Dongjiaominxiang.

755
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,160
They turned to Cao Rulin residence in Zhao Jialou Hutong instead.

756
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,960

laid foundation for the establishment of the Communist Party of China.

794
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,760
Not only ideologically,

795
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,120
but also prepared in human resource level.

796
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,120
It provided possibility for new revolutionary forces, revolutionary culture and revolutionary battle

797
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
for them to step onto the stage of history.

798
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,200

00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,760

803
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,240
and country's development.

804
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,960
Down with the traitor Cao Rulin!

805
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,480
Down with the traitor Zhang Zongxiang！

806
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Down with the traitor Lu Zongyu!

807
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
Down with the traitor Zhang Zongxiang!

808
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,360
Defend our country!

809
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:36,800


810
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,200


811
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,320
Down with the traitor Zhang Zongxiang

812
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
LaoGuo, are you alright?

813
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,080
Is Guo okay?

814
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,520
Take him to the hospital now.

815
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,680
hurry up

816
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,640
Guo

817
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,520
Hang in there.

818
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,320
Guo

819
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Defend our country!

820
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
We have to arrest these students.

821
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Students' disturbances must be severely punished.

822
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,880
You can use the police when necessary.

823
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,000
Right

824
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,360
Arrest them.

825
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,320
Let me tell you something, these students--

826
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,200
Premier Qian arrives.

827
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
I gathered everyone this late at night.

828
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,880
It's for urgent matter. Please sit down.

829
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,600
Today, students from Peking University

830
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,520
and others from more than a dozen schools marched in the streets.

831
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,040
They also burned Zhao Jialou.

832
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm sure you all already know.

833
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,120
President Xu is very angry about this matter.

834
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,600
Ask our cabinet to come up with a plan immediately.

835
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,600
In case things get worse. 

836
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,280
General Duan also called.

837
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,920
Require strict control over troubled students.

838
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,720
Now, please let Cheif of Army Li Changtai

839
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
present an introduction to the situation.

840
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,720
Members of the cabinet

841
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,720
This task of introducing the situation,

842
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,040
it should be Wu Bingxiang of the Metropolitan Police Department.

843
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Wu Bingxiang, this old prick, dare not come.

844
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,040
So, allow me to take over.

845
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,200
Things are like this,

846
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,280
From 1: 00 this afternoon

847
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,040
More than 3,000 students from more than a dozen schools in Beijing

848
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,880
started parade on the streets.

849
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,320
This student nonsense

850
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
is particularly serious in nature.

851
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,680
The influence is very bad.

852
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,560
President Xu Shichang has given the order.

853
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,840
Ban the parade immediately

854
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,840
And stop students from making trouble.

855
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,440
He also asked the cabinet

856
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,840
to make a rapid action plan.

857
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,800
Prevent something worse from happening tomorrow.

858
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,320
Cheif Li has made it clear.

859
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160


860
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,880
Let's discuss.

861
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
They must be arrested.

862
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,200
Repression.

863
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,880
Passers-by made the secene worse.

864
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,120
It's no good arresting them.

865
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,560
Here's my view on this.

866
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,600
Students are troublesome indeed,

867
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,960
but what's even worse is those behind it.

868
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,160
Cai Yuanpei, headmaster of Peking University

869
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,080
And several backbones around him.

870
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,320
Like Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao.

871
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
They are the culprit.

872
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,480
Should be severely punished.

873
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,440
This Cai Heqing has done nothing good 

874
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,640
since he was in charge of Peking University.

875
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,360
In my opinion, he must be dismissed.

876
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
I would like to remind you that

877
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,360
What caused this student parade

878
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,440
It was the humiliating Paris Peace Treaty.

879
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,280
Cai Yuanpei

880
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,160
Is the first education chief of the Republic of China. 

881
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,160
Since he took charge of Peking University 

882
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,520
he has won people's favor through a serious of measures. 

883
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,720
If he leaves Peking University

884
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,280
It is bound to lead to greater public grievances.

885
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
The consequences would be unthinkable.

886
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,840
Those people from the Ministry of Education and Cai Yuanpei

887
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
they are all on the same side.

888
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,200
This mess students made

889
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,800
is the result of your appeasement.

890
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,200
This Cai Yuanpei must leave.

891
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,040
Must be removed

892
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,080
Gentlemen

893
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,640
I think

894
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,920
Fu, chief of the Ministry of Education, is thinking too much about this.

895
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,960
You said Cai Yuanpei's position is unshakable.

896
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
What if Cai Yuanpei dies?

897
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,800
Is Peking University gonna shut down?

898
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,160
Premier

899
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,200
But then,

900
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,360
What we discuss today

901
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,680
is not about removing Cai Yuanpei.

902
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,680
But how to prevent worse situation from happending.

903
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,760
Fundamentally speaking, this matter

904
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,680
is the responsiblity of Ministry of Education

905
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,360
But we are the Republic of China.

906
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,520
There is laws and regulations.

907
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,800
It's students' affairs

908
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,640
Of course, it's up to the Ministry of Education.

909
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,080
Public security matters

910
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
Of course, the police department is in charge.

911
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
The Chief of Army should take care of army business. 

912
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
You'd better stay out of this.

913
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,840
So as not to make things getting serious.

914
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,840
I heard that the students who were caught

915
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,480
they are still locked up in army's jail.

916
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,320
That's against the regulation.

917
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,160
So, inform Wu Bingxiang.

918
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,800
Tell him to immediately take the captured students

919
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,320
move them to the police station.

920
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
How interesting.

921
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,400
I worked all day long on this.

922
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
Turns out what I did is wrong.

923
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,200
Fine, I will walk.

924
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,120
I'm meeting General Duan, reasoning with him.

925
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,720
Lao Li

926
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,080
Don't go!

927
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,080
Don't go!

928
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,160
Lao Li

929
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,720
Don't go. You can't go

930
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,640
Please sit down, everyone.

931
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,240
I discussed it with President Xu.

932
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,760
To deal with this matter,

933
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,600
we have to be tough in the action.

934
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,040
But be gentle in the words.

935
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,000
The goal is not to make things worse.

936
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,800
The most important thing right now is May 7th. 

937
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
The National Convention held in Central Park

938
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,080
In any case, they cannot be allowed to hold this conference.

939
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,560
This National Convention can't lead to anything good.

940
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,360
We can't even start to imagine the outcome.

941
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
Students.

942
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,320
According to the information from each school

943
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,920
It has been found out.

944
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,320
A total of 32 students were arrested.

945
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,240
There are twenty students from Peking University.

946
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,760
Eight people from teacher's college.

947
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,520
Two people from industrial specialized school.

948
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,680
One from Huiwen University and one from University of China.

949
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,400
These students now

950
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,400
are in the jail under amry department.

951
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,720
Xu Deheng and other students from Peking University,

952
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,040
they are locked up in the standing cage prepared for felons.

953
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,400
Humiliated and tortured.

954
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,400
Word is that

955
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,840
Reactionary warlord Duan Qirui

956
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,360
aims at revenge for traitor Cao Rulin.

957
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,160
He gave orders to severely punish the arrested students.

958
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,480
Their lives are in danger now.

959
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,160
The situation is not optimistic.

960
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,480
We must not stand by and watch.

961
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,240
We will not.

962
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,080
Never.

963
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,800
Must not

964
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,840


965
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,680


966
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,800
Please be quiet.

967
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,640
Quiet please

968
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,880
Mr Cai has arrived.
