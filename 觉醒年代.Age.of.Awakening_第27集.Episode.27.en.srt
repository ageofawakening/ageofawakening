Xingang

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,080
Xingang, what's wrong with you

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Xingang, say something, you

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,560
you

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,840
新港新港你说说话

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
Don't scare me.

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,680
this

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,600
What happened to your hair?

Xingang, say something. 

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,520
Let's go.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,600
Come on, Xingang, let's not stay here.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,400
go

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,440
Let's go.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
Come and get up.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,240
come

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,240
Let's go find Mr. Zhongfu. Let's go.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
Let's go find Mr. Zhongfu.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,640
Xingang

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Brother Zhongfu writes well.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
Every sentence is written in my heart.

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Want to really change and become a country

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,680
We can't do it alone.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,640
exactly

39
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,760
Zhongfu

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,440
Zhongfu

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,320
中富先生

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,720
Come in

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,240
What's the matter? This is

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
新港病了

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,280
Why is your hair all white? 

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
What's the matter? This is

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,880
Xingang, he was stimulated by the Paris Peace Conference.

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,840
fail to take a resigned attitude

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,000
I sat by the river in the wild all night.

50
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,400
It's probably a cold.

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
Suddenly passed out. 

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm going to get him some brown sugar water. 

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,440
Right away.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
XingangXingang

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,200
you

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,720
Why do you think you are so heavy?

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,360
What's wrong with you? Say it.

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,960
Everyone can find a way.

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,720
sir

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
Sir, I'm fine.

61
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,440
I just haven't been able to sleep for two days.

62
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,000
I can see my father as soon as I close my eyes.

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560
As soon as I close my eyes, I see my father.

64
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,720
My father

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
It turned out to be the company commanders of Dengzhou in Qing Dynasty.

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,040
Gaoyuan Zhang's generals

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
In 1897

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,360
German East Asia Fleet Commander

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
Dietrich attacked Qingdao.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,520
My father is in Jimo County.

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,960
Have a thousand battles with them.

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,520
Later, he was dismissed and returned home.

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
It wasn't long before my father died of illness.

74
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
Before dying

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
Wen called me to my side and told me.

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,040
Xingang Qingdao was lost in my hand. 

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,320
When did Qingdao take it back?

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,800
You must tell me.

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,760
Sir, Xingang doesn't understand

80
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Didn't we win?

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
Germany defeated

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Qingdao should take it back.

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,800
I wanted to tell my father at his grave.

84
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,080
you see

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
Qingdao has taken it back now.

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,800
Qingdao took it back.

87
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
But now what's going on?

88
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
The last thing my father said before he left was

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
Lu You's "Showing Children"

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
That after death everything becomes void, I surely perceive

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,840
Yet, not to have seen my country unified is still what makes me grieve

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,200
Julian Waghann Beiding Zhongyuan

93
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,400
In your ancestral sacrifices Forget not tell your sire 

94
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,120
Xingang, it's no use being sad.

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
You must have stayed up in the wild last night.

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
I also had a sleepless night.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
Wrote three articles.

98
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,800
Bai Lan, read this for everyone.

99
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
Paris peace conference

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,040
All countries focus on their own interests.

101
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
What justice? What permanent peace?

102
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,960
What's President Wilson's Fourteen Declarations?

103
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
Has become a worthless empty talk.

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,920
France, Italy and Japan are three militaristic countries.

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Because they don't call their ambition to invade the king's land.

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
Whip will throw a tantrum and quit the peace meeting.

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
I watch this spoils distribution meeting. 

108
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Permanent peace with the world

109
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
True happiness of mankind

110
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,000
It's eight thousand miles apart.

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
More than 108,000 miles apart.

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
People all over the world stood up.

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
It cannot be solved directly.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
If you rely on the spoils sharing meeting

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,760
Those politicians and diplomats

116
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
Close the door there.

117
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
There must be no good fruit.

118
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,240
Sir means

119
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
You can't rely on others alone.

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
The people must stand up by themselves. 

121
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
It cannot be solved directly.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
That's what it means.

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840
Xingang, things have gone wrong. 

124
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
At this time?

125
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,320
It's no use being sad.

126
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
The imperialist government is unreliable.

127
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
China's feudal government is also unreliable.

128
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
What is reliable?

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
ourselves

130
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,200
At this time

131
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,440
We can only and should stand up.

132
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
With our own strength.

133
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
Save our own country. 

134
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
You said, sir.

135
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,560
What should we do now?

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,440
Go into action

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Resolutely resist that shameless peace treaty

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,720
Never let the Beiyang government

139
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
Sign that ridiculous peace treaty.

140
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,840
We must fight like your father.

141
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
You have to believe.

142
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,560
Through our efforts.

143
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,000
Your father's last wish

144
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
It will come true one day

145
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,080
sir

146
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
I listen to you.

147
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,640
Gentlemen, I'll follow you.

148
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,720
good

149
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Xingang drank the brown sugar water.

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,640
The president arrived.

151
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,280


152
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,360


153
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
Bo Tang heard that

154
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
The opinions of your foreign affairs committee have come out. 

155
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,160
Tell me about it.

156
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,360
Lu Zhengxiang is urged by several telegrams a day.

157
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,920
So officially, everyone signed it. 

158
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,400
Sit down.

159
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,920
Look at the traitor's involvement

160
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,200
Dare not be serious

161
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
Tell me specifically.

162
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,840
Actually, it's just two words, visa refusal. 

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,120
Refuse to sign

164
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,720
Is it easy to say, considering the consequences?

165
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
We discussed it for two days.

166
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
All the consequences have been considered.

167
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,800
But a telegram from Lu Zhengxiang said

168
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
If we don't sign a peace treaty

169
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
At least Japan, Britain, France 

170
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
Four Italian countries

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,160
Will challenge us.

172
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,360
in that case

173
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,400
What we lost.

174
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,040
It's not just Germany's rights and interests in Shandong 

175
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
But the rights and interests of the whole country.

176
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,400
Then the loss will be great.

177
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
Our victorious country

178
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,360
Will really become nothing!

179
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
Have you considered this?

180
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Lu Zhengxiang never did.

181
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
Told me about this problem.

182
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
But he tells me that every day.

183
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
What does Lu Zhengxiang mean?

184
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,200
His meaning is very clear.

185
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
He advocates signing.

186
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
So as not to lose big because of small things.

187
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,120
Lu Zhengxiang's eyes are short-sighted.

188
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
When the country and the people suffer, they should be cut to pieces.

189
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,160
Uncle Tang, is this a thousand dollars?

190
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
Bo-Tang, what is this king of yours?

191
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
Isn't this a discussion?

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,440
You this

193
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,720
President Xu

194
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,200
Premier Qian

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
Open your eyes.

196
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
Republic of China (1912-1949)

197
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
If you sign this peace treaty

198
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
Do you dare to step out of the gate of the Presidential Palace? 

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,000
Brother Tang

200
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,920
Dangerous words have been heard. 

201
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
Now I need you to answer Lu Zhengxiang's question. 

202
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
Sign and not sign

203
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Which one after all?

204
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,520
The loss of rights and interests of our country is even greater. 

205
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,400
Lu Zhengxiang is simply a worrywart.

206
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,280
talk nonsense

207
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,200
All the spearheads of the Paris Peace Conference

208
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
It's all about coercion.

209
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,160
The Versailles system must tear Germany to pieces.

210
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
How can it bargain with China?

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,960
Anyone with diplomatic common sense 

212
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,640
Will not ask this question.

213
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:17,840
sit

214
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
According to what you say.

215
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,160
Lu Zhengxiang is overrated.

216
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,080
This is not a problem at all. 

217
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,640
Premier Qian

218
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,080
I

219
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
I really want to hear your opinion.

220
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,680
I

221
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:35,840


222
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
Listen to the president. 

223
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,200


224
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,680
sit down

225
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,720
Acting Chief Chen, what's your opinion?

226
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
I am a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
Has signed the message of refusal.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,560
president

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,240
This is what we have drawn up.

230
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
Refusal to sign a telegram to a Chinese envoy

231
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,560
The president of Qing Dynasty passed himself.

232
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
What's your opinion?

233
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
Refuse to sign

234
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
Since everyone thinks it's okay to refuse a visa

235
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Then please Premier Qian.

236
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Send it in the name of the State Council.

237
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
But this matter must be kept secret.

238
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
Those dolls can't know.

239
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
It's the president.

240
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
You go to the telecommunications office

241
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,360
Generate electricity for Lu Zhengxiang immediately.

242
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,320
It's still dark in Paris.

243
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,680
right now

244
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,280
I want to lambaste Lu Zhengxiang.

245
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,640
This treacherous little man.

246
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
Why does he advocate signing a contract?

247
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
Because of this, you don't need to send a telegram.

248
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,520
I can tell you the truth.

249
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,120
What truth?

250
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,240
Do you know?

251
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,320
Lu Zhengxiang didn't even offer to sign the contract.

252
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
Duan Qirui asked him to analyze it in detail.

253
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
European and American countries include Germany.

254
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,440
Attitude towards Shandong issue

255
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
Lu Zhengxiang's long analysis report

256
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
One paragraph is about the analysis of Germany.

257
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,120
Duan Qirui, pick it out alone.

258
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
And approved eight words.

259
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,320
A small loss outweighs the gain.

260
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
Cao Rulin used this as a basis to find Xu Shichang

261
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
Said Lu Zhengxiang thought

262
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
Advocate signing a contract for the long-term benefit.

263
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,880
How do you know so detailed?

264
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,040
Lin Changmin came just now.

265
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,320
You are not here.

266
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
He asked me to tell you.

267
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,880
I said

268
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,760
Xu Shichang looks strange like this.

269
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
Originally wanted to take me to Tangsai Duan Qirui.

270
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,520
This old scoundrel

271
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,680
Did Xu Shichang agree to refuse the visa?

272
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,080


273
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
Strong consent

274
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Has been handed over to Qian Nengxun in the name of the State Council

275
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
Issue a visa refusal telegram

276
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,920
Great

277
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,080
Now you can have a good sleep. 

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm still not at ease. 

279
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
You go to the telecommunications office immediately.

280
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,480
In my name

281
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
Send an urgent telegram to Lu Zhengxiang.

282
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
Take note of the telegram.

283
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
No matter how stupid people are. 

284
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,600
You can't make the same mistake twice.

285
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Chinese people will not allow the second Li Hongzhang.

286
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,520
delighted

287
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,040
I'll send it right away

288
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,960
Tell him to call me back as soon as possible.

289
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,200
good

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Shiyan, do you need some strong paste in your area?

291
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,600
Ok, when I finish writing this one 

292
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,000
good

293
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,640
come

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,640
classmates

295
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,640
Mr. Shouchang, Mr. Shouchang

296
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,840
Yes, sir. Hello, sir

297
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,520
Let me tell you three things.

298
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,960
first

299
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
Wang called Mr Cai.

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
Said the national government had ordered

301
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
Diplomatic missions in Paris

302
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Refuse to sign a peace treaty

303
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,920
good

304
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
The second situation is 

305
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
National diplomatic association

306
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,360
Sent a notice.

307
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,880
It is scheduled for May 7th.

308
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,840
Hold the National Convention in Central Park.

309
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,600
Boycott the Paris Peace Treaty

310
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,040
We in Peking University

311
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,800
And students from various schools.

312
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,080
To be the main force of this conference.

313
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,360
The third situation

314
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
Now the whole country has taken action.

315
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
Especially Shandong.

316
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,960
Shanghai

317
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,840
Guangzhou

318
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,840
Are in different forms.

319
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,800
adopt

320
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Boycott movement

321
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,160
Thanks to the New Culture Movement

322
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,640
Set up two flags of science and democracy.

323
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,120
Only then can we break the old world.

324
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,800
See this new world

325
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,720
I remember Mr. Zhongfu.

326
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,400
Once said a word

327
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,520
He said he would not talk about politics for twenty years. 

328
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,920
He should concentrate on enlightenment.

329
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
Now, of course, he also realizes

330
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,640
It was biased to say this at the beginning.

331
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Because of science and democracy

332
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
It is inseparable from politics itself.

333
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,360
Democracy itself is politics. 

334
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
We want to talk about science and democracy.

335
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,880
Politics will come to you.

336
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,320
I can't hide it.

337
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,920
Think about it, everybody.

338
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
Everything we've done in Peking University in the last three years.

339
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,400
Which thing can be separated from politics?

340
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,720
I want to ask everyone

341
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,960
What is democracy?

342
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Democracy means that the people are the masters of the country. 

343
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
Xingang is right

344
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,840
Is the country of the Chinese people.

345
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
So the family should be the people's responsibility.

346
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,000
The Lord should be done by the people. 

347
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
This is the proper meaning of the country.

348
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,520
But the Republic of China has been eight years.

349
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,280
I want to ask everyone

350
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,560
What's the one thing

351
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Our people are the masters of the country.

352
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,320
not have

353
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,680
right

354
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
Duan Qirui last year

355
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,120
Sign a secret agreement with the Japanese

356
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,880
Did he ask the people's opinions?

357
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,160
not have

358
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
Even Chinese emissaries.

359
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
I didn't know there was such a secret agreement.

360
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,480
false advertising

361
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,920
win fame by deceiving the public 

362
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
Fool the people

363
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
So I said

364
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
This Paris peace conference

365
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,000
It's not just a bad thing. 

366
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,440
Is also a good thing.

367
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
What makes you say that?/How so?

368
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
Because of this Paris Peace Conference

369
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,280
Awakened all of us Chinese.

370
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
If China wants to develop

371
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,360
We can't just oppose feudalism. 

372
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,880
Advocate a new culture

373
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,640
But also oppose imperialism.

374
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,960
Defend our own sovereignty

375
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
To do these two things

376
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
We have to wake up the people.

377
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,320
Only when the people wake up can China have hope.

378
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,560
So, students.

379
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
Our lecture group on civilian education

380
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,200
Go deep into the grassroots as soon as possible.

381
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Go deep into the factory.

382
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
Go deep into the fields.

383
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,360
Our various societies

384
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Go deep into every corner of society.

385
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,960
To awaken the people.

386
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,160
What do you think?

387
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,120
sir

388
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,120
We are now preparing to set up. 

389
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,440
Beijing Students' Federation of Secondary Schools and Above 

390
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
Connect all schools in series. 

391
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
Facilitate large-scale activities.

392
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,480
Our public education lecture group

393
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,920
Huai Bei is divided into four teams.

394
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,320
Make a series of speeches in Changxindian and other places respectively.

395
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,920
We are preparing.

396
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
The National Assembly on May 7th.

397
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
Plan a parade of 100,000 people.

398
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:36,880
good

399
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,840
good

400
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,880
classmates

401
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
Then let's act now.

402
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,800
nicely

403
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,680
Dry up

404
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
The national government has declared Lu Zhengxiang.

405
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
Refuse to sign the peace treaty

406
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
So the speech of this National Assembly

407
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
Be sure to pay attention to discretion.

408
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,200
There must be no voice to denounce the government. 

409
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,920
chairman of the committee

410
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,040
There is one more important point.

411
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
That is, it can never appear

412
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
The voice of abusing President Wilson

413
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao from Peking University

414
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,680
In the Weekly Review

415
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,240
Publicly accusing President Wilson is worthless.

416
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
This disregard for the overall situation

417
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,200
That can't be advocated

418
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
We should target the Japanese.

419
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,880
And pro-Japanese factions in China.

420
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,760
Cao Rulin

421
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,720
zhang zongxiang

422
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,520
Hezong

423
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,160
chairman of the committee

424
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,760
What's up?

425
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,360
Something big has happened.

426
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,680
say

427
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,000
The State Council has secretly sent a message to Paris.

428
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,280
Agreed to sign the contract

429
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,160
Okay, let's do this first.

430
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,200
How is that possible?

431
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,040
Telegram from a fellow villager in Lin Changmin.

432
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,240
Send a telegram by hand.

433
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
He secretly told Lin Changmin.

434
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,880
There can be no mistake.

435
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,000
Where is Lin Changmin now?

436
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll go find him. 

437
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
Lin Changmin just

438
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
Gave Xu Shichang a resignation report.

439
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,680
This is the note he asked me to bring to you.

440
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,960
This government is treacherous.

441
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,520
I can never go along with it.

442
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,120
I also resign.

443
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
Chairman, at this time

444
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
You can't just walk away.

445
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,560
Chairman Lu Zhengxiang telegram 

446
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,760
read

447
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
Please help me, Brother Bai Tang. 

448
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
Xu Shichang shameless

449
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,360
Duan Qirui shameless

450
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Qian Nengxun is shameless

451
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,920
You send a telegram to Lu Zhengxiang immediately. 

452
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
Just say he wants me to save him.

453
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
He has to remember my words.

454
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,120
This agreement can never be signed.

455
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,680
If he signs it

456
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440
Then he will be.

457
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,120
The unforgivable sinner of the Chinese nation.

458
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,800
Spare car

459
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm going to see Cai Zimin

460
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,920
You two go there.

461
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,640
Where are you going?

462
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,280
I know

463
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,440
Mr. Cai

464
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,120
Chairman Wang has arrived

465
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Please hurry.

466
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,680
good

467
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,040
subjects of a kingdom

468
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,720
Brother Tang

469
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
Big bad

470
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,360
Don't try again

471
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
We will have no face for future generations.

472
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,080
Brother Tang

473
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,520
Why so?

474
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,360
Xu Shichang Duan Qirui

475
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,720
Go back on one's word.

476
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
I have sent a telegram to Paris today. 

477
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,360
Agreed to sign the Paris Peace Treaty.

478
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,880
Lu Zhengxiang signed it 

479
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,520
not yet

480
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,560
He sent me a telegram just now asking me to save him.

481
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
I can't save him.

482
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
Can't save Shandong.

483
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,040
Now it's up to the students.

484
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,760
Brother Tang, tell me.

485
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,160
I am a scholar. What can I do?

486
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,120
You can

487
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
You Cai Zimin have Peking University.

488
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,080
There is a China behind Peking University.

489
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,200
40 million Chinese people only need one heart. 

490
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
China will not die.

491
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
Thank you brother Botang for your advice.

492
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,960
Yuan Pei has his own decision.

493
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
The reason why I called everyone together urgently

494
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
There is a big thing.

495
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,400
To discuss with everyone.

496
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,200
The Beiyang government has ordered Paris's emissaries.

497
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
Agree to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

498
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
Officially hand over Shandong to Japan 

499
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
This has become a foregone conclusion.

500
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
That's open treason.

501
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
Mr Cai, we can't stand by and watch.

502
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,040
We both know.

503
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
Patriotic Zongchang of Peking University.

504
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
When the nation is in great trouble

505
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
We can never stand by and watch.

506
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,000
I told Wang Da just now.

507
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
the country is faced with a crisis

508
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
I Cai Yuanpei will not go to hell.

509
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,640
Who goes to hell?

510
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
Mr Cai, I will go to hell with you.

511
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,480
Every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the world.

512
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
The country is in trouble

513
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,120
I will go to hell with you.

514
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,800
Going to hell is useless. 

515
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,880
I have thought about this question for a long time.

516
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
It was an article by Shouchang that inspired me.

517
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,880
He said that the Russian October Revolution

518
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,240
It is a victory for the common people.

519
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,160
The subalterns in Russia use violence.

520
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
What about our Chinese Shu family?

521
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,280
Can we use democracy?

522
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,960
I think I can try.

523
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
Our country is the people's country.

524
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,840
The people have the final say in the country of the people.

525
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,000
Now Beiyang government violates public opinion.

526
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,520
Betray the sovereignty of our country. 

527
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,480
what's to be done 

528
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,160
I said there was no other way.

529
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
Only let the people stand up and solve it directly.

530
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
How to stand up and solve it directly

531
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,240
Change from sitting to discussing to doing.

532
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,000
We need to be pioneers at Peking University.

533
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
Awaken the masses to be masters of the world.

534
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
Let's also give him a subaltern victory.

535
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,720
Mr. Cai

536
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
Deng Zhongxia, they are organizing the Beijing Federation of Students.

537
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
I urged them to act quickly.

538
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,120
And this operation should not only be for students.

539
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
Workers and soldiers

540
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,560
All strata should take action.

541
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
All levels of society are taking action.

542
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
This is the action of the common people.

543
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
To force the reactionary government to give in.

544
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
I agree with Zhongfu and Shouchang.

545
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,720
If we take the lead at Peking University

546
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
Mobilize the people of the whole country. 

547
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
That will be the beginning of a brand-new history.

548
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
Yes, you are among young people.

549
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,680
Is very influential and appealing.

550
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,280
Zhongfu said just now

551
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,760
Let the people stand up and act directly.

552
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,160
I think this sentence should be a slogan.

553
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,160
Shout this slogan out.

554
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,560
Mobilize the people

555
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
You two once said 

556
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,720
Talk about politics directly

557
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
I still had doubts and reservations at that time.

558
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,840
Now it seems.

559
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
You have foresight.

560
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,720
But it's easy to lose sight of one thing and another thing in haste.

561
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,440
Mr. Cai

562
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
I see what you mean.

563
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,040
I'm going to Changxindian now.

564
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,640
Put the results of the Paris Peace Conference 

565
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,840
Tell the workers brothers

566
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,160
good

567
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,280
寿昌先生

568
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,040
Pay attention to safety.

569
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,600
Laiyucai

570
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,520
Let's discuss it.

571
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,280
This operation

572
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,920
How should we do it concretely?

573
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,600
Mr. Cai

574
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,200
Mr. Cai

575
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,520
Mr. Cai

576
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,160
Please sit down with the teachers and classmates.

577
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,040
Today, teachers and student representatives

578
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,200
Gather up urgently

579
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
There's really something we have to do.

580
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
The Paris Peace Conference has now adopted a

581
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
unequal treaty

582
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,360
The content of the treaty 

583
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,600
Is to defeat the country before the war

584
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,920
All rights and interests of Germany in China

585
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,520
All handed over to Japan.

586
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,440
Everyone knows

587
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,720
China's status as a victorious country

588
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,040
Attending this Paris Peace Conference

589
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,800
At this peace meeting

590
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
As a defeated country, Germany

591
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,320
It should

592
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,080
Occupy the land and rights of Shandong, China 

593
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,840
All returned to China unconditionally.

594
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
However, at this peace meeting

595
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,120
They ignore me, China. 

596
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,120
And openly passed such a

597
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,160
Unequal Paris Peace Treaty

598
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
Our current government

599
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,800
Already called the Chinese delegation in Paris.

600
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Ask them to 

601
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
Sign this shameful peace treaty.

602
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,520
Everyone knows

603
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,200
As long as this word is signed

604
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,360
So we in Shandong

605
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,560
It becomes Japanese.

606
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,480
classmates

607
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,280
But every Chinese

608
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
Can we promise?

609
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,520
nonacceptance

610
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,920
I came to Peking University three years ago.

611
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm a survivor, a dream.

612
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,680
To make Peking University a success

613
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,680
Excellent educational school

614
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,480
Behind the excellent educational schools.

615
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,560
Just write two words accurately.

616
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,640
love one's country

617
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,120
In my opinion.

618
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,560
Patriotism is our future in Peking University.

619
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,320
Soul and tradition

620
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
My Peking University student.

621
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
Not to be an official yourself.

622
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,040
But to contribute to the country. 

623
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,760
Be a pillar of the country.

624
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
Now the country has arrived.

625
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,200
A critical moment of survival

626
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
Every one of our Peking University students

627
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
Everyone should step forward.

628
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,480
Be a pioneer in saving the country from peril.

629
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,960
We need to arouse the people.

630
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
Urge the government

631
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,960
Refuse to sign this unequal Paris peace treaty

632
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
Defend our sovereignty

633
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,040
My classmates and teachers

634
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,240
Let me ask you

635
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,480
Do you have the courage and strength?

636
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,320
have

637
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,000
Defend sovereignty and refuse to sign a peace treaty 

638
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,000
Defend sovereignty and refuse to sign a peace treaty 

639
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
Defend sovereignty and refuse to sign a peace treaty 

640
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,440
Defend sovereignty and refuse to sign a peace treaty 

641
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,680
People at this intersection must concentrate.

642
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Otherwise, you can't form power, okay? 

643
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,000
After the concentration, we can't reach the number. 

644
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,280
Then here, here, here, here 

645
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:41,840
Here?

646
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,600
How can there be not enough people at such a small intersection?

647
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
Sir, Master Ge, here they come.

648
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,880
Mr. Dazhao

649
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,600
Shugui

650
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,400
Mr. Dazhao

651
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,000
Thank you for your support.

652
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,560
thank you

653
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,280
Mr. Dazhao

654
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
Our workers also want to serve our country.

655
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,240
Do something.

656
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,760
What can we do for you? 

657
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,800
Just go ahead.

658
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,400
All right, everybody, have a seat.

659
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,680
Let's sit and talk.

660
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:01,920
good

661
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,360
Shugui

662
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,280
There is such a situation now.

663
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,280
Our lecture group on civilian education

664
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
Set a speech route.

665
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,000
All over the map.

666
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,440
I want you to do me a favor. 

667
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,360
Look at which block has the most workmates.

668
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,480
Let's go there first.

669
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,320
I think of the time.

670
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,400
Our workmates are here.

671
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
Will be the most.

672
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,560
Write it down.

673
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:24,800
okay

674
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,920
And Mr. Dazhao.

675
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,560
I'll think then.

676
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
Arrange some workmates

677
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
Keep order with our classmates.

678
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,440
classmates

679
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,880
Not long ago.

680
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,800
The Paris Peace Conference has been passed.

681
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,160
Put our rights and interests in Shandong

682
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
Unequal treaties handed over to Japan

683
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
As long as this word is signed

684
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,280
Shandong is Japan's

685
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,240
classmates

686
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
Can we promise this kind of treaty?

687
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,560
cannot

688
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,920
Never promise

689
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,960
Never agree to it.

690
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
Look at the uniforms you are wearing.

691
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,840
Look at the emblem of Peking University we are wearing. 

692
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,600
Peking University should take patriotism as its soul and tradition.

693
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,000
At the time of our country's survival

694
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
Can we show this courage and responsibility?

695
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:58,880
can

696
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,600
can

697
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,520
The meeting just now.

698
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,640
Do you have anything to add? 

699
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,920
no more

700
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,000
I think I need to talk to other students. 

701
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay, that's settled then.

702
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,440
May 3rd in the auditorium of Peking University Third Hospital.

703
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,960
Hold a general meeting of all students.

704
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,720
Except Peking University students.

705
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,480
More than a dozen other schools should be mobilized.

706
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
Send a representative to attend

707
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,800
Do you have any questions?

708
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,320
no more

709
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,840
Then please, everyone.

710
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,120
Take action

711
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,320
classmates

712
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,240
Let me read it out below.

00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,200

00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,200

The Chinese nation pursues national independence.

802
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,760

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,520
Send it to the hospital quickly.

815
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,680
hurry up

816
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,640

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,520
Hang in there.

818
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,320
Guo

819
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Love China

820
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
We have to catch these students

821
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Students' disturbances must be severely punished.

822
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,880
You can use the police when necessary.

823
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,000
right

824
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,360
Have to catch

825
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,320
Let me tell you something, these students.

826
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,200
Premier Qian arrives.

827
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
Calling everyone so late.

828
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,880
It's also urgent. Please sit down.

829
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,600
Peking University today

830
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,520
And more than a dozen schools marched in the streets.

831
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,040
And burn Zhao Jialou.

832
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm sure you all already know.

833
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,120
President Xu is very angry about this matter.

834
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,600
Ask our cabinet to come up with a plan immediately.

835
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,600
In case things get worse. 

836
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,280
Master Duan also called.

837
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,920
Require strict control over troubled students.

838
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,720
Now, please step up and lead Li Changtai.

839
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
Make an introduction to the situation.

840
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,720
Members of the cabinet

841
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,720
The job of introducing the situation

842
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,040
It should be Wu Bingxiang of the Metropolitan Police Department.

843
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Wu Bingxiang, this old prick, dare not come.

844
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,040
Let me take his place.

845
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,200
Then I'll tell you about it.

846
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,280
From 1: 00 this afternoon

847
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,040
More than 3,000 students from more than a dozen schools in Beijing.

848
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,880
Start the street parade.

849
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,320
This student disturbance

850
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
Particularly serious in nature

851
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,680
The influence is very bad.

852
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,560
President Xu Shichang has given the order.

853
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,840
Ban the parade immediately

854
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,840
And stop students from making trouble.

855
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,440
And asked the cabinet

856
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,840
Make a quick action plan.

857
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,800
To prevent something bigger from happening tomorrow.

858
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,320
Li Tongling took the situation

859
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
It's been made clear.

860
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,880
Let's discuss it.

861
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
It must be arrested.

862
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,200
Is repression.

863
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,880
Passers-by made these whistles

864
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,120
It's useless to arrest.

865
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,560
You want me to say it?

866
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,600
This student disturbance is abhorrent.

867
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,960
But what's even worse is who's behind it.

868
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,160
Cai Yuanpei, President of Peking University

869
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,080
And several backbones around him.

870
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,320
陈独秀李大钊等人

871
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
Is the culprit.

872
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,480
Should be severely punished.

873
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,440
This Cai Heqing has been in charge of Peking University since

874
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,640
He hasn't done a good thing.

875
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,360
In my opinion, he must be dismissed.

876
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
I would like to remind you that

877
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,360
Student parade

878
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,440
It was the Paris Peace Treaty that humiliated the country. 

879
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,280
Cai Yuanpei

880
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,160
Is the first education chief of the Republic of China. 

881
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,160
Since he took charge of Peking University 

882
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,520
Take a series of measures to win the hearts of the people. 

883
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,720
If he leaves Peking University

884
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,280
It is bound to lead to greater public grievances.

885
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
The consequences would be unthinkable.

886
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,840
Those people from the Ministry of Education and Cai Yuanpei

887
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
Wearing a pair of pants.

888
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,200
Students make trouble.

889
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,800
Is the result of your appeasement.

890
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,200
This Cai Yuanpei must be removed. 

891
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,040
Must be removed

892
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,080
Ladies and gentlemen

893
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,640
I thought ...

894
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,920
Fu, chief of the Ministry of Education, listened to some dangerous words.

895
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,960
You said Cai Yuanpei's position is unshakable.

896
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
What if Cai Yuanpei dies?

897
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,800
Is Peking University closed?

898
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,160
premier

899
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,200
Of course

900
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,360
What we're going to discuss today

901
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,680
It's not about removing Cai Yuanpei.

902
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,680
But how to prevent the situation from further expanding.

903
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,760
Fundamentally speaking, this matter

904
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,680
Responsible Ministry of Education

905
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,360
But we are the Republic of China.

906
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,520
Do things in a proper way. 

907
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,800
Students' affairs

908
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,640
Of course, it's up to the Ministry of Education.

909
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,080
Public security matters

910
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
Of course, the police department is in charge.

911
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
The army is at the head of the army. 

912
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
You'd better stay out of this.

913
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,840
So as not to make things too big.

914
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,840
I heard that the students who were caught

915
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,480
Up to now, he's still locked up at the door of the step army.

916
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,320
It's just illegal.

917
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,160
So inform Wu Bingxiang.

918
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,800
Tell him to immediately take the captured students

919
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,320
Send it to the police station.

920
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
Ah, fresh

921
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,400
Make half a day.

922
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
There's something wrong with my efforts.

923
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,200
Okay, I don't care

924
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,120
I'll find a section teacher to reason with me.

925
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,720
Lao Li

926
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,080
Don't go!

927
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,080
Don't go!

928
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,160
Lao Li

929
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,720
Don't go. You can't go

930
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,640
Please sit down, everyone.

931
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,240
I discussed it with President Xu Da. 

932
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,760
Deal with student disturbances

933
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,600
We have to be tough.

934
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,040
Be gentle.

935
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,000
The reason is not to expand the situation.

936
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,800
The most important thing right now is May 7th. 

937
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
The National Convention held in Central Park

938
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,080
In any case, they should not be allowed to hold this conference.

939
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,560
