Facts are facts.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,280
Face it or not,

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,200
you decide.

Greetings.

[Shen Yinmo, Professor at Peking University]

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,160
Why you are here?

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
I heard that you were beaten and hospitalized.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,600
How are you now?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,200
Thank you, sir. I'm fine now.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
My sudden visit disturbed you writing.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,840
It's all good.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,200
The students went on strike.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,560
I have nothing to do either.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,160
Might as well practice my handwriting.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
My style of calligraphy

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,680
is influenced by the master Chou Laizhi from Nanjing.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,440
Using the long-haired soft Chinese brush.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
But I still hold my wrist properly.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,920
So your father often criticizes me

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
that my handwriting is too vulgar.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,160
So now,

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040

He enjoys criticizing people.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
You don't need take his words seriously.

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,640
Come and sit.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
Help me bring this up.

33

Come and sit.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,120
Yannian, you came to me.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,560
Is it for my confession?

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,000
Why do you say that?

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,680
Not long ago,

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,880
there are rumors everywhere accusing your father's immoral behaviours.

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
People talk a lot about it.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
Tang Erhe talked to Mr. Cai

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
to cancel the department dean system,

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,320
remove Zhongfu from the post of liberal arts dean.

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,840
I seconded the motion at that time.

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
I do regret it.

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
I feel I did Zhongfu wrong.

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
Yannian, if that

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
affected your family.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
I am willing to make amends to you.

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,960
Sir.

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,800
Please don't do this. Please sit down.

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
It's not about that.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
Someone gave me some materials the other day,

53
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
said that you and Principal Tang are insiders.

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,960
So I figured

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
I'd check about it with you face to face.

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,760
Someone made this up on purpose.

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,400
Untrustworthy.

58
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,680
Indeed, Zhongfu has been at the forefront.

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
This is a fact.

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,040
His "New Youth" has made a reputation out there,

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
too much influence for his own good.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Those who oppose it will surely want to put him down.

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,120
To achieve this goal,

64
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
they'd go to the extreme.

65
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,560
Then, does Principal Tang knows

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,000
the truth of this matter?

67
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
Tang Erhe should also know

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
that this is a deliberate rumor.

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
Because your father once scolded Tong Erhe and

70
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
he was wrong that time, he couldn't face that,

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
so he just avoided it all.

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Then why did you and Principal Tang propose

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,960
to bring the dean system to an early closure?

74
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,360
Yannian, since you asked,

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,840
I'll have a good talk with you about it.

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm from the same town as Mr Cai.

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm standing in his shoes

78
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,120
regarding this issue.

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,720
Your father is a honest man with a blunt character.

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,320
He offended many people,

81
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,160
which made him a target of public criticism.

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
For Peking University and President Cai,

83
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,800
he is a troublemaker.

84
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Since it has been proposed to abolish the senior system.

85
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
It's better to execute it earlier.

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,320
So Mr. Cai won't be embarrassed too much.

87
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
Of course, I have my own agenda too.

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,880
Zhongfu can't control his temper or his mouth.

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
He often makes it difficult for me in public.

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
I don't want him to be my immediate superior.

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,200
This is my selfishness.

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Yannian, it's good you came.

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,360
So I can use this chance to speak my mind.

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
These days, because of my selfishness

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
I couldn't sleep well and regretted it a lot.

96
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
Now,

97
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,200
I can't even visit the editorial department of "New Youth".

98
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
I can only hide here and practice my handwriting.

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,600
Sir, don't blame yourself too much.

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,080
What you said is of great use to me.

101
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,080
Do you think I should go to see Principal Tang,

102
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,080
ask Principal Tang about this?

103
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
Principal Tang should have the same feeling.

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
It's all for Mr. Cai's sake

105
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
and he does have a grudge against your father.

106
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,160
It's no use asking him.

107
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,920
I do remember

108
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
Hu Shizhi specifically investigating this matter

109
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
and refuting Tang Erhe.

110
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,080
In that case,

111
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
those materials can't be trusted.

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Good.

113
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
Thank you, sir. I'll be going now.

114
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,600
Goodbye.

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,920
Chen Yannian.

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
You look like you're deep in your mind.

117
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,960
Chen Yannian, are you still not well?

118
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
Why don't I talk to the nurse?

119
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,600
They might give you another day, and we'll stay.

120
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
The consequences of your boredom

121
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,440
look so serious.

122
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Not even a single word.

123
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
I'm talking to you, do you hear me?

124
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
My brain is now

125
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
more awake than ever.

126
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,920
Auntie.

127
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,085
You two are all packed up.

128
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:50,800
All packed up.

129
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Liu Mei, I have a rickshaw at the entrance.

130
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
Let's put the luggage on first.

131
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,920
Yannian.

132
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,840
You finish the papers there, it's not done.

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Okay, okay, okay.

134
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
Leave it, you just got out.

135
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll do it. I'll do it.

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
I'll do it. I can do it.

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,280
Mrs Chen.

138
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,320
Please sign your name.

139
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,080
If a gentleman named Zhang comes to me,

140
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
please forward this letter to him.

141
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,080
Come on.

142
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,840
What about the luggage?

143
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,360
Liu Mei took them all out.

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,640
Ah, brother.

145
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
Why did you make an appointment at such a place?

146
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,640
It's on the moutain,

147
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
and quite far away.

148
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
It made me nervous for a while.

149
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
How's your head? Are you feeling better?

150
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
All healed.

151
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,320
That's good.

152
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
Have you verified the case?

153
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,440
Am I lying?

154
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
I went to both of them.

155
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
It's just like you said.

156
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Honestly, when I first found out about this,

157
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
I was so angry that I almost fainted.

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
What are you going to do, brother?

159
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
What can I do?

160
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,040
I'm taking my little brother to France.

161
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
We are leaving from all the mess here.

162
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
You are leaving?

163
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,360
This is not you, Chen Yannian.

164
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
What do you suggest I do?

165
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,000
I think

166
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
you should at least step out.

167
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,960
Persuade your father to admit his mistake,

168
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
be a good man again.

169
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
Stop him from getting more influence and making it worse

170
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,600
for the reputation of this student movement.

171
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
Chen Duxiu, if he can ever take my advice,

172
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
that is not him.

173
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,760
He's been like this all his life, and he can't change it.

174
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Then we have all the reasons to

175
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
tell the truth to the people.

176
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
What you said earlier,

177
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,120
that if people knows about this,

178
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
it'll be a devastating blow to the student movement.

179
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,160
Right.

180
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,840
And now you're saying

181
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
we should make this public.

182
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,880
You are against your own words now.

183
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
No, no, it's not contradictory at all.

184
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,920
Brother, no beginning without breaking the old.

185
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
Instead of letting Chen Duxiu

186
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
destory the student movement,

187
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,000
why don't we overthrow him first and seek another leader?

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,040
Another leader?

189
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,760
Who will that be?

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
In Peking University, in the Academic Union,

191
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,600
there are so many respected professors.

192
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
Anyone can do it.

193
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,680
Okay, that makes sense.

194
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,520
Then let me get this straight.

195
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
What's in it for me?

196
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
What?

197
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
I can't believe you want benefits.

198
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,280
I have seen now

199
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,640
what kind of man Chen Duxiu really is.

200
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
A patriotic student movement?

201
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
It's a joke.

202
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
Now that I have decided to go to France.

203
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,840
Then I must plan for myself in the future.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
My brother.

205
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,720
You changed your heart faster than I thought.

206
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
I need time to adapt.

207
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,080
What do you mean?

208
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,800
It's that..

209
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
Suit yourself then.

210
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
I didn't say no to offer you something.

211
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,360
So

212
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
if you and Chen Qiaonian

213
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,680
sign this statement.

214
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
As soon as it's on the newspaper tomorrow,

215
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
I'll help you two right away.

216
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
I will make sure all procedures for studying in France done smoothly.

217
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
What do you say?

218
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,200
What signature can be this valuable?

219
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,560
This here

220
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,920
is a statement to expose Chen Duxiu's moral corruption

221
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,480
and to disown him.

222
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,240
Don't worry.

223
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
This is the right thing to do.

224
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
It will never affect the image of you two brothers.

225
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
Are you serious about this?

226
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes.

227
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,080
OK, I can sign this.

228
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
But you have to promise me two conditions.

229
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
Say it.

230
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,080
First, studying abroad will be publicly funded.

231
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,360
This is no problem.

232
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,760
Second, give me five hundred yuan.

233
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Dude, you are asking for too much.

234
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,920
If you can promise

235
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
I can sign this now.

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
Okay then. Don't hesitate.

237
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
Okay, I promise.

238
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,160
Words are empty.

239
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
Write it down, I can't just rely on your words.

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,280
Liu Mei set me up just a few days ago.

241
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
You want to set me up again?

242
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
You think me as a fool?

243
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
Let me tell you something, Chen Yannian.

244
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
No way I will write it down.

245
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,560
If you want to do this,

246
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,080
this time tomorrow

247
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
this place.

248
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
I promise you five hundred yuan.

249
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,040
As for studying in France,

250
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,200
that's a lot to do, give me two days.

251
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,800
But I promise

252
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
I, Zhang Fengzai, keep my word.

253
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,440
Stay away!

254
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
Guo only passed away not long ago.

255
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
I am finishing this bastard today for him.

256
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,560
Calm down.

257
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,440
What are you doing?

258
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,720
We're all classmates. Don't get violent.

259
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,080
Violent?

260
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,960
I told you so.

261
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,920
We should just go for the hard way.

262
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
Chen Yannian, how can you do this?

263
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,280
You brothers are making a deal with him

264
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
in front of us now, aren't you?

265
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,760
What deal?

266
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
He, no need talking to him.

267
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,080
Just do it.

268
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,040
Wait!

269
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,760
Come here!

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,880
What's the situation?

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Good or bad?

275
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
Today, I am the mad cop.

276
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
Kill you with no reason!

I dare you to lay one finger on me.

284

Come and aim here.

285
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,520
If I even blink,

286
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
I'll start calling you Daddy.

287
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,840
Ok, son!

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Daddy's gonna give you a hiding!

289
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
I got a letter from home.

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
Tomorrow I'm going back to Shandong to get married.

291

A companion for Guo will be Bai Lan.

297
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
Take this, son.

Yes, yes, yes.

Go, dig a hole now.

Don't hurt anyone.

without discussion?

345

How dangerous it is in case something happens!

346
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,680
We thought that

347
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,880
Mr. Zhongfu can't know about it.

348

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
Yannian, we go see your father.

373
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,960
Grinding scissors!

374
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,920
Sharpening kitchen knives!

375
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,760
Grinding scissors!

376
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,280
Sharpening kitchen knives!

377
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,120
Grinding scissors!

378
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,160
Sharpening kitchen knives!

379
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,880
Grinding scissors!

380
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
You need to put--

381
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,000
Shouchang is here.

382
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,200
What's up?

383
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,880
Is brother Zhongfu home?

384
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,200
In the study, he's been writing all day.

385
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,680
What's the matter?

386
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,320
Brother Zhongfu.

387
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,120
Why did you come?

388
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,240
I have something to discuss with you.

389
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,880
What's up?

390
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,520
Zhang Fengzai, the one got expelled from Peking University,

391
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,960
you remember him, right?

392
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
I remember. Why?

393
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
He has now become

394
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,880
a spy for the Metropolitan Police Department.

395
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:28,197
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Professor at Peking University]

396
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,520
He tried to woo Yannian against you.

397
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,560
And the result?

398
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
Yannian found out a lot inside dirt.

399
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
Shiyan and the others have an idea.

400
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
They want to make these things public.

401
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,040
What do you think?

402
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Good. A matter of great satisfaction.

403
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,480
But as a result,

404
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
it can lead to

405
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,040
a strong reaction from the reactionary government.

406
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
I saw too many strangers outside your house just now.

407
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,720
I know.

408
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,040
Those incapable ones they send to here.

409
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,040
They really don't know who they are dealing with.

410
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,040
No. Brother Zhongfu.

411
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
I know you're not afraid.

412
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm not afraid either.

413
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
We are both on the blacklist.

414
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
If they are here, they are surely at my place too.

415
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
But have you thought about one thing?

416
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,600
Say if something happens to us.

417
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,160
We can face our death without hesitation.

418
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,920
But what also will be under attack,

419
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
is "New Youth"

420
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
and the "Weekly Review",

421
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,920
and the student movement, which is on the fast track now.

422
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,880
I see.

423
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,280
You are trying to tell me

424
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
that it's best we take a step back

425
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
and hide ourselves, right?

426
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
That makes sense. I agree.

427
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
But I can't stay at home all day.

428
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,280
I have to do something.

429
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,720
I have arranged it for you.

430
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,760
Next week,

431
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm the rotation editor of "New Youth".

432
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
But I have too many things to do.

433
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,040
Why don't you take it?

434
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,880
Fine.

435
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,960
The minion Zhang Fengzai has confessed himself.

436
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
Now the reporters are flooding

437
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
gate of the Metropolitan Police Department.

438
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,200
How do you want me to explain it to people?

439
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,400
Chief.

440
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,000
You have to help me this time.

441
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,240
You have no idea, Chen Yannian and his people

442
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
they are like gangsters.

443
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
You were beaten.

444
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
You lost dignity, you wrote the confession

445
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,680
which made it to the paper.

446
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,000
You sold out the whole police department.

447
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,720
And you are making up this gangster bullshit now?

448
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,320
You're quite talented, aren't you?

449
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
You don't know how scary they were.

450
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,720
I was almost buried.

451
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,400
You are such a puss.

452
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
A few threatening words

453
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,320
and you are like this.

454
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
The reporters are out there now.

455
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
You explain it, you do it.

456
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
I encountered with gang members.

457
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,920
If I didn't write those, I couldn't have made it back alive.

458
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
A forced confession.

459
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,879
[Wu Bingxiang, Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department]

460
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,720
What do you mean?

461
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
You can't see?

462
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,680
Gang members control the student movement,

463
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,120
catching a newspaper reporter.

464
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
The reporter, hoping to stay alive,

465
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
had to do as they said,

466
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
and confessed to being part of the Metropolitan Police Department.

467
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,760
This is the truth.

468
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,040
A forced confession.

469
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
A forced confession.

470
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
It seems that this can only be the case now.

471
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,600
Come on, you made all this up.

472
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,880
Write materials for me.

473
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
I will hand to Qian Nengxun as evidence.

474
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,440
Gang members colluded with the student movement.

475
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,840
This kind of accusation can keep them busy for a while.

476
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,320
Chief.

477
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,640
What's this?

478
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,080
I already prepared the materials.

479

Hurry, we can't stop the reporters anymore.

482

Let them wait.

Did you see that?

484
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
I have to wipe your ass this time.

485
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,560
Stay away from the press, don't let reporters see you.

486
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
Shouchang, Yannian told me everything.

487
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,320
You should be careful yourself these days.

Don't worry about me, sister-in-law.

489

Brother Zhongfu is crucial this time.

490
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
You have to keep an eye on him.

491
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,000

There is benefit.

this will grow out of control.

557
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
Throughout the whole country,

558
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
Shanghai has implemented a general strike.

559
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,800
In Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha and other places,

560
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,160
there have also been strikes.

561
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,560
Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Students Federation

562
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
is planning a full mobilization.

563
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,920
If it carries on like this,

564
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
Shanghai is highly likely to become the second center of the student movement

565
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,560
just like Beijing.

566
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,720
Once the movement from North and South join each other,

567
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,800
it will lead to terrible situation.

568
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,280
The Japanese ambassdor protested multiple times.

569
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,040
The Japanese army is eager to move.

570
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Britain, America and France were originally neutral.

571
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
But recently, there's sign of them joining forces with Japan

572
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,520
to oppress the Chinese government.

573
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,640
This shows that these countries have lost patience and hold dissatisfaction

574
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,280
on the current situation in Beijing.

575
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,800
Well, you two have analyzed the situation thoroughly.

576
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,320
Let me summarize.

577
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,680
First,

578
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,320
the strict measures we have taken have paid off.

579
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
Comparing the current situation with before,

580
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,760
it's more relaxed now.

581
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
What does that mean?

582
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,080
It shows that the students are scared.

583
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,440
Second,

584
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,440
this student movement has went on for too long.

585
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,240
Endurance in all aspects has reached its limit.

586
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
It's time to end it.

587
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
If we don't behave, we will suffer from chaos.

588
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
So tomorrow, I will issue a presidential decree

589
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,280
to take tough measures to force schools to resume classes.

590
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Students are not allowed to use any excuse

591
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,720
to protest on the streets.

592
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
Who do not obey will be punished severely.

593
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
Premier Qian will be coordinating the general operation.

594
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,160
The metropolitan police department

595
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,440
and the garrison headquarters will carry the execution work.

596
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
If no one objects,

597
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
this meeting is over now.

598
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,280
Mr. President, a word alone please.

599
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,800
Mr. President,

600
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
The new infantry commander Wang Huaiqing

601
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
and the garrison commander Duan Zhigui

602
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,760
been waiting for you for long.

603
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
Let them wait.

604
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,560
Understood.

605
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,840
Mr. President,

606
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,080
with this kind of drastic measures,

607
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,520
and having Wang Huaiqing

608
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
replace Li Changtai as the commander,

609
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,080
have you considered the consequences?

610
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,200
Just now,

611
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
didn't you advocate being tough?

612
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,800
How come that changed at a glance?

613
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
Yes, though do we need to adopt such drastic approach?

614
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,960
Police, gendarmes, troops all together.

615
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
Brother Juren,

616
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
Wang Huaiqing is known as the butcher.

617
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,160
Duan Zhigui always says that

618
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
ten years with no schooling

619
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,040
is better than one more day of what's going on now.

620
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,440
Having these two join hands to direct the suppression

621
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
might get out of hand in the end.

622
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
Duan Qirui insisted that

623
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,040
Wang Huaiqing and Duan Zhigui should be in charge.

624
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
There is nothing I can do.

625
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,440
And what about Paris?

626
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,880
Tomorrow, the presidential decree will be out

627
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
that Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, and Lu Zongyu's resignation

628
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,400
are not granted.

629
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
Public opinion will be all over us.

630
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
What's the use of telling me this now?

631
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,080
Why didn't you say so at the meeting?

632
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
Other than complaining in front of Brother Juren,

633
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
what else can I do?

634
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
You have me to complain to,

635
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't even know who I have for that.

636
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,320
This country is at the point of no return,

637
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,080
there's nothing much that we can do.

638
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,160
We just have to wait and see.

639
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,360
If worst comes to worst, we'll just piss off.

640
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,520
Why are soldiers here?

641
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,280
Ah, what's going on

642
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,560
So many troops are here.

643
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,560
Get out of the way!

644
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,160
Damn, they are on the move.

645
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,520
We have to hurry back to the Red Building.

646
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Listen to me.

647
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,680
I'll find Mr. Shouchang.

648
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,280
You guys go to the library.

649
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,840
Inform each class.

650
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,825
Go! Move!

651
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:37,200
Go!

652
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,400
Haiwei.

653
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
Go to Qianmen Avenue and find Bai Lan.

654
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,880
They are selling domestic products there.

655
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
Go quickly. Those soldiers will go after them.

656
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,120
OK, don't worry.

657
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,440
Go.

658
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,560
Here you are.

659
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,240
Thank you for supporting domestic products.

660
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,760
There are toothbrushes and tooth powder.

661
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
This is canned food from Guanshengyuan.

662
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,600
Please support us.

663
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,720
Support domestic products.

664
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
Please buy a toothpaste.

665
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,560
Support domestic products.

666
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,280
Please.

667
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
Hello, fancy some domestic products?

668
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,520
Thank you.

669
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,920
Protect our sovereignty and support domestic products.

670
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
Support domestic products, please.

671
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Bai Lan, Bai Lan!

672
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,200
Run! Run!

673
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,400
Run!

674
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,840
Run!

675
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,240
Let go of me!

676
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
He Mengxiong!

677
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,320
Qunxian!

678
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,120
He Mengxiong!

679
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
Leave me, run!

680
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,520
Get down!

681
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,320
Let go of me!

682
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
Why are you arresting me?

683
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,680
Qunxian!

684
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,240
Let go of me!

685
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Let her go!

686
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,680
Let go of me!

687
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,680
Let go of me!

688
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,120
Qunxian!

689
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,120
Qunxian!

690
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,520
Tell me about the students.

691
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,840
The Beijing Federation of students

692
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,240
just had a meeting in the auditorium of Beijing Normal University.

693
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,000
They decided unanimously

694
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,920
to resume the large-scale speaking activities tomorrow.

695
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
It is estimated that thousands of people will take to the streets.

696
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
Now all schools are preparing for it overnight.

697
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,840
Yipin.

698
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
Report the situation of Peking University to the director.

699
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,640
Yes.

700
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,960
Students of Peking University are now making

701
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,480
flags and slogans,

702
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,760
preparing for tomorrow's speech.

703
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,720
From what we know,

704
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,560
Peking University's Red Building, its Law School, and the Horse God Temple,

705
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,360
in these three places alone,

706
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,720
there will be about five hundred people tomorrow.

707
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,800
These students are really not afraid of death.

708
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,640
We arrested seventy people today.

709
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,320
The detention center is full.

710
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,920
What should we do tomorrow?

711
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,960
Halt for tomorrow?

712
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
No, proceed.

713
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,200
We can take the Red Building in Peking University.

714
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,720
That place can hold a thousand people.

715
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
No way, that will attract too much attention.

716
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,160
There are professors too.

717
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,480
We can't afford to mess with them for now.

718
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,960
We can take Peking University Law School by Beiheyan Avenue though.

719
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
Not far away.

720
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
Are General Duan's troops stationed there?

721
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
There are ten tents on each side of the school gate.

722
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
Okay, that's it then.

723
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,440
Notify Duan Zhigui and Wang Huaiqing

724
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,320
to get ready.

725
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Assign seventy percent of the police force out for tomorrow.

726
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,680
The day after the tomorrow is the big one,

727
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
All hands on deck.

728
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,880
That's all.

729
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,760
Understood.

730
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,040
Wait, wait, wait.

731
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,760
Come back!

732
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,080
Keep in mind.

733
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
We want these students

734
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,920
to go back to where they come from.

735
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,880
Understand?

736
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,280
It's called control, not arrest.

737
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,160
Clear?

738
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,040
Clear.

739
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,200
Go.

740
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
We want to take Qingdao back.

741
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,760
We aren't the ones who lost this war.

742
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
We didn't invade other's lands.

743
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,800
Then why is this government banning

744
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
the national patriotic movement?

745
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,560
Now we can't help but send out

746
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,320
a pitiful voice.

747
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,480
To the military and police compatriots,

748
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,920
we are the same people, we share the same roots, why going after us?

749
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,960
Keep your voice down.

750
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,960
Your dad just fell asleep after writing all night.

751
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Uncle Chen's words are truly powerful.

752
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Auntie, let me.

753
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,520

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,320
How about we go to the street today,

757
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,920
reading this passage to the police?

758
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,440
Well, maybe the police will be moved to tears.

759
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:51,920
No.

760
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
The police are now arresting and beating people.

761
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
You two must not go to the streets.

762
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,200
No.

763
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,800
I have seen worse.

764
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm not bending.

765
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,760
Nevertheless,

766
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
I said you are not going out.

767
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
Nobody goes out today.

768
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,520
I couldn't sleep well last night.

769
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,800
Kept dreaming of Qunxian.

770
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,480
I don't even know where she's locked up.

771
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,760
No news at all.

772
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,520
I'm so anxious.

773
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,560

Your teacher is sleeping.

776
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
Any news of Qunxian?

777
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,080
Nothing.

778
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,040
But I heard that

779
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,480
they might be in the metropolitan police department.

780
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
I've been to there, had books to read.

781
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,400
I think Qunxian should be fine.

782

I want to write a letter,

861
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,160
mainly to clarify

862
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,560
two issues that everyone is concerned about.

863
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
What are the issues?

864
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,640
First, in the New Culture Movement,

865
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,000
how do we define the debate

866
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,680
between reformers and conservatives?

867
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
Second, what is us reformers' view

868
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,960
on traditional Chinese education?

869
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
I'm also interested in these two issues.

870
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,520
Pleae tell me more.

871
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,640
Interested?

872
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,240
Well, this is what I think.

873
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,400
First, I think

874
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,520
this debate between reformers and conservatives

875
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,240
is a phenomenon of academic progress.

876
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,040
It's an academic dispute, not a fight.

877
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,640
For example, Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao,

878
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,680
Hu Shi, Lu Xun, and Qian Xuantong of Peking University.

879
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,440
Their dispute with Gu Hongming, Liu Shipei,

880
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,560
and Huang Kai,

881
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,680
it is of such nature.

882
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,440
That's not what Huang Kan thinks.

883
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
His language is vicious.

884
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Arguments, opinions, they can get bit aggressive in a debate.

885
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,840
The two sides even scold sometimes.

886
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,040
This is normal.

887
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
Throughout the history of countries around the world,

888
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,000
this process exists

889
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,800
in the development of new culture.

890
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,280
Reformists and conservatives are relative figures.

891
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
A conservative today

892
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
could be a reformer in the past.

893
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,240
A reformer today

894
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,480
might turn to a conservative in the future.

895
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,440
There is no end to the evolution of the world.

896
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,000
So, the struggle between the reformers and the conservatives

897
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,000
has no end as well.

898
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,560
Even in another million years,

899
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,120
things will be the same.

900
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,800
The world will still be the world where

901
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
the reformers and the conservatives are against one another.

902
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,840
Look, today, we are reformers.

903
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,840
Gu Hongming and others are conservative.

904
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,360
The environment might change tomorrow.

905
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,360
Maybe it will be reversed.

906
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,280
This is the historical view of evidence.

907
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,880
So you are saying that

908
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,040
maybe one day Gu Hongming's point of view

909
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,400
can also be correct?

910
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,000
First, you have to admit

911
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,960
Gu Hongming, Liu Shipei, and Huang Kan,

912
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,360
these are people with specialized knowledge.

913
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,240
Secondly, even now,

914
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,880
some of their views are still reasonable.

915
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
This fight between them and us,

916
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,800
in the end, it is the need of social change.

917
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,400
At a certain time,

918
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,400
when living conditions have changed,

919
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,080
people's understanding of the dispute between the old and the new

920
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
will also change.

921
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,400
It will even reverse.

922
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,360
Do you understand?

923
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,040
Yes, I do.

924
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
What's the second issue?

925
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,200
The second one.

926
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
What is us reformers' view

927
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,880
on the traditional Chinese education?

928
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,640
Remember what I said today.

929
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,200
Because there may be some people in the future

930
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,320
argue over this issue.

931
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,240
My general opinion is that

932
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,760
the traditional Chinese education

933
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
is a part of world scholarship.

934
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,160
Confucianism,

935
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
it is a part of the traditional Chinese education.

936
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,640
The Three Principles of Confucianism

937
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
is a part of Confucianism,

938
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,680
but only a small part.

939
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,640
As for the existence of the fundamental value within Confucianism,

940
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,560
we do not object.

941
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
Wait a minute, too complicated.

942
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
I'm a little confused.

943
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
So what exactly do you object to?

944
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,720
That's a good question.

945
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
Complicated? Then I'll make it easy.

946
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,000
We are opposed to honoring that very little part

947
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,040
that is the Three Principles of Confucianism

948
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,320
as the ultimate guideline for moral standards.

949
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,240
We are also opposed to trashing all that

950
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
traditional part of Chinese eductaion

951
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
as if they worth nothing at all.

952
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,480
Why the reformers attack Three Principles of Confucianism?

953
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,520
Except for how it is not suitable for the present social life,

954
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,280
what I said also makes one of the reasons.

955
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
I get it now.

956
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
But Mr. Wu Yu and Mr. Yi Baisha,

957
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,360
their aggressive attitudes

958
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
don't match what you just said.

959
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
Didn't I just say that?

960
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,880
There are excesses and overcorrections in the debate.

961
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,160
This is inevitable.

962
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,160
This letter of mine,

963
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
I intend to

964
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
publish it in the next issue of "New Youth"

965
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,720
If it can't be published, you have to testify for me.

966
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,320
Regarding me, Chen Duxiu, my attitude and stance

967
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,000
in the New Culture Movement.

968
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
I'm afraid I can't do that.

969
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,040
I think,

970
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,800
it doesn't matter what future generations think of us.

971
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,920
The important thing is

972
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,240
do we have a clear conscience facing ourselves.

973
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,800
Good point. I agree.

974
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,600
The way you said that is like my father.

975
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,480
Chen Yannian, remember,

976
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,360
about the New Culture Movement,

977
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,440
about the debate between reformers and conservatives,

978
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,320
I'll only tell you this once today, just this once.

979
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
Look, your temper is showing again.

980
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,760
No such thing.

981
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,160
All right, you can leave now.

982
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,760
I've said everything I have to say.

983
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,920
He's having fever?

984
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,360
Sister Qunxian, nature calls.

985
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,600
Wait a minute.

986
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,960
We need to go to the bathroom.

987
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,280
We need to go to the bathroom.

988
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
Hold it!

989
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
We need to go to the bathroom.

990
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,560
Students!

991
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,440
Girls, come here.

992
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,640
Form a circle.

993
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,720
Boys, stand up and turn around.

994
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,160
Boys, come here.

995
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,680
Su Wu, the diplomatic, kept his faith while being detained by the enemy.

996
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,760
Nothing was there for him except the snow and ice.

997
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,440
Nineteen years of servitude and exile.

998
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,960
Only snow to water his throat and rugs to fill his stomach.

999
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,480
Years after years as a shepherd.

1000
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,640
Never for one second he forgot his country and his mission.

1001
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,400
The imperial staff that came with him lost all attached fur, yet he was still trapped in the foreign land.

1002
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
He went through torture and starvation, death threats and endless coldness.

1003
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,520
None of that shook even a little bit of his faith.

1004
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,840
Sitting thousands miles away from homeland, he could hear in his mind old songs from his people.

1005
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,880
It brought him pain and tears.

1006
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,640
Fellow workmates.

1007
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,361
[Changxindian]

1008
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
Now the reactionary government

1009
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,040
has gone after the students.

1010
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,000
They have arrested many students,

1011
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,840
had them all locked up in Peking University.

1012
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,240
The whole country is taking actions.

1013
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,720
Our workmates in Shanghai have taken to the streets.

1014
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,440
We here in Changxindian can't fall behind.

1015
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,440
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind!

1016
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,280
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind!

1017
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,520
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind!

1018
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,480
Can't fall behind!

1019
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,000
Fellow workmates.

1020
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,720
The workers in Shanghai don't just take to the streets.

1021
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
They have issued a strike declaration.

1022
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,040
On top of that,

1023
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,440
they are planning to start a workers' organization,

1024
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
to lead this social movement

1025
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,550
Workmates, think about it.

1026
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,040
The working class is stepping onto China's political stage.

1027
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,240
This is an epoch-making event.

1028
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Here, I propose that

1029
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
we should also act quickly.

1030
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,400
We should also stand at the forefront of this movement.

1031
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,440
What do you say?

1032
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,160
Yes!

1033
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,280
Mr. Shouchang.

1034
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,200
Mr. Shouchang.

1035
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,800
Come, Zhongxie.

1036
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,400
Workmates!

1037
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,360
Quiet, everybody, quiet.

1038
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,040
Let's listen to Zhongxie.

1039
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,520
He has an update on the meeting of the students' association.

1040
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,640
Go ahead, please.

1041
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,960
Fellow workers, fellow friends.

1042
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,400
Today is the day the reactionaries took the most strict approach.

1043
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,160
So far,

1044
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,520
we already have about

1045
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,520
more than a thousand students arrested.

1046
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,600
They are now being held in

1047
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,040
law and science department of Peking University

1048
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,200
There is no water, no food,

1049
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,960
no supplies at all.

1050
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,320
So the Federation of Students decided

1051
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,440
starting from tomorrow,

1052
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,960
the goal of this movement

1053
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,920
is the all-out rescue for the arrested students.

1054
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,280
We need to unify the whole country.

1055
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,440
Through all available means,

1056
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,600
force the reactionary government to release the people.

1057
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,520
Now the Federation of Students is preparing the declaration.

1058
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,120
Tomorrow morning,

1059
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,120
we will have five thousand students divided in three groups,

1060
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
marching on the streets at the same time.

1061
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,080
These five thousand students will address the same,

1062
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,400
carrying bags and food.

1063
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,120
They will request to be with their arrested classmates,

1064
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,160
locked up if it's what it takes.

1065
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,360
The rest of the students,

1066
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,560
divided based on schools,

1067
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,320
will go to the Ministry of Education or the Presidential Palace or the police department

1068
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,760
for a sit-in demonstration

1069
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
demanding the release the arrested classmates.

1070
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,440
I have four copies of our rules.

1071
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,840
I'll hand it out to you later.

1072
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,320
Fellow workers and friends,

1073
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,760
just in these two days,

1074
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,880
hundreds of our classmates in Peking University

1075
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,120
were violently arrested.

1076
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,880
Students from No.1 Middle School and No.4 Middle School tomorrow

1077
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,240
will also help us.

1078
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,680
Now we urgently need your help and support.

1079
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
Workmates, I suggest

1080
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,440
after this meeting,

1081
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
we form units from each branch factory

1082
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,240
go to the streets to help the students

1083
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,120
and go to the Presidential Palace to petition.
