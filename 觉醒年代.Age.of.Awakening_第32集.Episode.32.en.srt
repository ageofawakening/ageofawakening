[Episode Thirty-two]

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,640
Yannian

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,280
Facts are facts.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,280
Dare to face it?

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,200
Look at yourself.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,880
enter

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Yannian

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,160
How did you come?

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
I heard that you were beaten and hospitalized.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,600
What, in the way?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,200
Thank you, sir. It's out of the way.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
I took the risk of visiting to disturb your writing. 

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,840
You're welcome.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,200
The students went on strike.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,560
I have nothing to do either.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,160
So I practiced my handwriting.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
This word of mine 

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,680
It was influenced by the old gentleman who hated Lai in Nanjing

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,440
With a long-winded sheep's hair

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
But I still can't mention my wrist.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,920
So your father often criticizes me. 

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
Words are common to the bone.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,160
For his words.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
Now I finish writing a knife of shakuhachi paper every day.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,160
He is a teacher.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
Don't argue with him.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,640
Come and sit.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
Help me bring this up.

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:34,720


32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,360
Come and sit.

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,120
Yannian, you came to me.

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,560
Are you here to plead guilty?

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,000
Why do you say that?

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,680
The previous stage

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,880
It is widely rumored in the society that your father is immoral. 

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
On the basis of dust.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
Tang Erhe suggested to Mr. Cai 

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
Cancel the senior system in advance

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,320
Remove Zhongfu from the post of liberal arts senior

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,840
I seconded the motion at that time.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
I've always regretted this.

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
I feel sorry for Zhongfu.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
Yannian, if this is the reason

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Affects the beauty department of your family.

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
I am willing to make amends to you.

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,960
sir

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,800
Please don't do this. Please sit down.

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
That's it.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
Someone gave me some materials. 

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
Also said that you and principal Tang are insiders.

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,960
So I wanted to come.

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
Check the situation with you face to face.

55
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,760
Someone should have made this up on purpose.

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,400
untrustworthy

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,680
Zhongfu has really been at the forefront.

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
This is a fact

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,040
The title of "New Youth" edited by him is too loud.

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
Too much influence

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Those who oppose it will surely kill them.

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,120
To achieve this goal.

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
It's even more extreme.

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,560
That principal Tang knows

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,000
The truth of this matter?

66
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
Tang Erhe should also know.

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
This is a deliberate rumor.

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
Because your father once scolded Tong Er and

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
Soup and self-knowledge indefensible dare not answer.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
Be defeated and flee.

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Then why did you and Principal Tang propose it?

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,960
Cancel the senior system in advance

73
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,360
Yannian, since you asked

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,840
I'll have a good talk with you about it.

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm from the same town as Mr Cai.

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm standing in his shoes.

77
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,120
Contemplative

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,720
What about your father, honest and frank?

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,320
Have offended many people.

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,160
Has become a target of public criticism.

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
To Peking University and to President Cai.

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,800
Brought a lot of trouble. 

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Since it has been proposed to abolish the senior system. 

84
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
It's better to execute it earlier.

85
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,320
This will not embarrass Mr. Cai too much.

86
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
Of course, I am selfish, too. 

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,880
Zhongfu is irritable and outspoken.

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
It often makes it difficult for me in public.

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
I don't want him to be my immediate superior.

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,200
This is my selfishness.

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Yannian, you're just in time 

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,360
Let me have a chance to say these words.

93
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Because these days, because of my selfishness

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
I really can't sleep and regret it.

95
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
Now I'm even

96
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,200
The editorial department of New Youth dare not lose it. 

97
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
I can only hide here and practice my handwriting.

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,600
Sir, don't blame yourself too much.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,080
Your remarks are of great use to me.

100
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,080
Do you think I need to go again? 

101
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,080
Ask Principal Tang to check this situation.

102
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
Principal Tang should think what I think.

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
It's all for Mr. Cai's sake.

104
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
And he has a grudge against your father.

105
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,160
It's no use looking for him.

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,920
I do remember.

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
Shi Zhi specifically investigated this matter.

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
And refuted Tomer.

109
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,080
In that case.

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
This fact is not believed.

111
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
good

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
Thank you, sir. I'll be going now.

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,600
say goodbye to

114
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,920
Chen Yannian

115
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
And thoughtful.

116
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,960
Chen Yannian, are you still not well?

117
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
Why don't I talk to the nurse

118
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,600
I'll give you another day, and we'll stay.

119
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
You stuffy gourd!

120
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,440
The sequelae are so serious.

121
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Not a word.

122
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
I'm talking to you, do you hear me? 

123
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
My brain is now.

124
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm more awake than ever.

125
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,920
auntie

126
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,800
It's packed.

127
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
I called a rickshaw at the door.

128
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
Let's put the luggage on first.

129
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,920
Yannian

130
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,840
You sign there. I haven't finished yet.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Okay, okay, okay

132
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
Just leave the hospital.

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll do it. I'll do it

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
I'll do it. I can do it. 

135
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,280
Mrs Chen

136
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,320
Please sign your name.

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,080
If a gentleman named Zhang comes to me 

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Please forward this letter to him.

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,080
come on

140
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,840
What about luggage?

141
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,360
Liu Mei took it all out.

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,640
Ah, brother

143
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
Why did you make an appointment with such a place? 

144
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,640
Yamanaka

145
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
It's all this way.

146
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
It made me nervous for a while.

147
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
How's your head? Are you feeling better?

148
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
All healed.

149
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,320
that's good

150
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
How about that? Have you verified it?

151
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,440
Am I lying?

152
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
I looked for both of them.

153
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
Just like you said.

154
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Honestly, when I first found out about this,

155
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
I was so angry that I almost fainted 

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
What are you going to do, brother? 

157
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
What can I do?

158
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,040
Take my brother to the French press.

159
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
Leave this place.

160
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
You have to escape.

161
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,360
This is not your quality, Chen Yannian.

162
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
What do you suggest I do?

163
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,000
I think

164
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
You should at least come forward. 

165
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,960
Persuade your father to admit his mistake

166
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
give up evil and return to virtue—turn over a new leaf

167
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
Don't influence and corrupt again.

168
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,600
The reputation of the student movement.

169
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
Chen Duxiu, if he can listen to my advice

170
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
He's not Chen Duxiu.

171
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,760
He's been like this all his life, and he can't change it.

172
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Then we should all the more.

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
Tell the truth to the people.

174
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
What you said earlier

175
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,120
If everyone knows about this,

176
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
It is a devastating blow to the student movement.

177
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,160
right

178
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,840
And now you're saying

179
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
To make this public. 

180
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,880
You are inconsistent.

181
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
No, no, it's not contradictory at all.

182
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,920
Bro, don't break or stand.

183
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
Instead of letting students exercise

184
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
Destroyed by Chen Duxiu's hand 

185
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Why don't we overthrow him first and set up another leader? 

186
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,040
Set up another leader

187
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,760
Who is it?

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Peking University Academic Union

189
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,600
So many respected professors.

190
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
Any one can do it. 

191
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,680
Okay, what you said is also reasonable.

192
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,520
Then let me get this straight.

193
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
What's in it for me?

194
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
any

195
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
I can't believe you want benefits.

196
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,280
I have recognized it now. 

197
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,640
He really looks like Chen Duxiu. 

198
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
What patriotic student movement?

199
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
It's a joke.

200
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
Now that I have decided to go to France.

201
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,840
Then I must plan for myself in the future.

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
I said, bro.

203
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,720
You have changed too much.

204
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm a little uncomfortable.

205
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,080
What do you mean?

206
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,800
Not you

207
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
Do you like to adapt?

208
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
I didn't say it wouldn't benefit you.

209
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,360
such

210
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
As long as you and Chen Qiaonian

211
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,680
Sign this statement.

212
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
See the newspaper tomorrow.

213
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
I'll help you two right away.

214
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Procedures for studying in France

215
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
What do you think?

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,200
What signature is so valuable? 

217
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,560
This is one.

218
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,920
Expose Chen Duxiu's moral corruption

219
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,480
And a statement declaring his separation from father and son.

220
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,240
Don't worry

221
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
This is the right thing to do.

222
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
It will never affect the image of your two brothers.

223
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
Are you serious about this?

224
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,400
take seriously

225
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,080
OK, I can sign this word

226
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
But you have to promise me two conditions.

227
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
You said

228
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,080
First, studying abroad is done at public expense. 

229
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,360
This is no problem.

230
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,760
Second, give me 500 dollars.

231
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Dude, this is a lion's big mouth

232
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,920
If you can promise

233
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
I can sign this word now.

234
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
Don't hesitate either.

235
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
Okay, I promise.

236
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,160
Say it empty.

237
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
Make a written statement without any evidence. 

238
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,280
Liu Mei just set me up a few days ago.

239
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
You want to set me up again?

240
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
You really treat me like a fool.

241
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
Let me tell you something, Chen Yannian

242
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
I will never set up this written document.

243
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,560
If you want to do this

244
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,080
This time tomorrow or

245
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
Or this place?

246
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
I promise you five hundred dollars.

247
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,040
As for studying in France.

248
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,200
This is too big. Please allow me two days.

249
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,800
But I promise.

250
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
I Zhang Fengzai keep my word.

251
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,440
stay away

252
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
Guo's bones are not cold.

253
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
I have to kill him today. I 

254
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,560
calm

255
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,440
What are you doing?

256
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,720
It's all classmates. Don't get killed

257
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,080
What kind of life is it?

258
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,960
I told you so.

259
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,920
The weak can't be tough.

260
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
Chen Yannian, is it interesting for you to do this?

261
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,280
You two brothers are in front of us today 

262
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
Make a deal with her, right?

263
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,760
What kind of deal do I make?

264
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
CSI: What do you need to say? 

265
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,080
Do it

266
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,040
Wait!

267
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,760
Come here!

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,880
What's the situation?

269
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,560
Which show are you playing?

270
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,160
Singing red and white faces with me here 

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Red and white face

272
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
Today, I will give you a bad face.

273
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
Kill you and chop you up.

274
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,840
Dare you

275
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
Do you know who I am?

276
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,360
I don't care what your status is.

277
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,880
Tell you.

278
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,520
I'm the metropolitan police department.

279
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,200
Deputy head of the intelligence unit

280
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,000
You touched me and tried to cut me. 

281
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,000
Come and chop here.

282
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,520
If I look at my eyes

283
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
I am your grandson

284
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,840
grandchild

285
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Grandpa, I'll cut you down today. 

286
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
Letter from my hometown.

287
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
Tomorrow I will go back to Shandong to marry my daughter-in-law. 

288
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,480
I did a big job before I left today. 

289
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,680
It kills you.

290
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,440
Give Guo a ride on the road.

291
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,160
step aside

292
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
Give Guo a companion. You're looking for Bai Lan. 

293
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,400
What do you want with me?

294
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
Chop your grandson.

295
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,640
kneel

296
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,120
Aauto Quicker, put it down. 

297
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Come down and kneel down.

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,680
Yannian, say something, Yannian

299
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
He has promised to write it.

300
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,080
Is it Zhang Fengzai?

301
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,040
Yes, yes, yes

302
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
I'll write it now. I'll write it right away

303
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
You two dig a hole. Go

304
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,280
Go and take it.

305
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
Don't hurt anyone.

306
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Don't get killed

307
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,800
Come on, guys.

308
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
Don't hurt anyone, don't kill anyone.

309
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,040
Yannian

310
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Yannian, say something, Yannian

311
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
You two stay away.

312
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,880
Don't spill all your blood.

313
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
Don't kill yourself to tell you. 

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,080
Give me an account of this today.

315
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,960
Write it all down clearly for me.

316
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,080
Okay, I'll write. I'll write

317
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,280
If you dare to leave a word behind 

318
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,480
I'll take it off for you.

319
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,880
I write, I write.

320
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:48,960


321
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,680
I write, I write.

322
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,480
come on

323
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
Write, I write, I write, I write right away. 

324
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,560
I'm writing it, Yannian

325
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
Stop digging, Yannian. I'm writing it.

326
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,120
Take a break, Yannian

327
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,920
You can write it.

328
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Fine. Then what

329
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,720
Don't get killed

330
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
What? I remember

331
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,360
When that night

332
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
Is it eleven o'clock or twelve o'clock

333
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Exactly what time?

334
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,520
half past eight

335
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,480
Yeah, yeah, 8: 30.

336
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,400
At 8: 30, we and Yannian

337
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,920
half past eight

338
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,320
Don't laugh and dig.

339
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,840
Do a full set of plays

340
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,800
Such an important thing

341
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,080
Why don't you discuss it? 

342
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,960
Act without authorization.

343
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,400
How dangerous it is in case something happens!

344
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,680
We consider this matter.

345
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,880
Mr. Zhongfu can't know

346
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm afraid something big will happen with his temper.

347
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,400
Now the struggle has entered

348
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,440
White-hot stage

349
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
In order to deal with the general strike of the reactionary government

350
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,200
Various differentiation methods have been adopted.

351
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,640
Win over many teachers and students.

352
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,640
You should report this situation to the Federation of Students at once.

353
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
Let them think about countermeasures.

354
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,440
At the same time.

355
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Mental preparation for large-scale repression

356
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440
Ok, Zhong Jie and I will go to the meeting of the Federation of Students later.

357
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
We want to give Zhang Fengzai's statement.

358
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
Give it to the newspaper for publication.

359
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,600
Do you think it's feasible?

360
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,400
agree

361
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,680
At this time, we have to be tit for tat. 

362
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,960
According to Zhang Fengzai

363
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,640
The police department has sent you and Mr. Zhongfu 

364
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Be included in the investigation list

365
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
And submitted it to the presidential palace.

366
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,280
Banning the National and Weekly Review

367
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
Wait for an application from a magazine.

368
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,680
You must pay attention to safety.

369
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,280
Go ahead and get busy.

370
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
Go to your father.

371
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,960
Grinding scissors

372
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,920
kitchen knife

373
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,760
Grinding scissors

374
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,280
kitchen knife

375
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,120
Grinding scissors

376
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,360
kitchen knife

377
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:43,840
Kitchen knife

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,400
Kitchen knife

379
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
kitchen knife

380
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,880
Grinding scissors

381
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
You're going to put

382
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,000
寿昌来了

383
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,200
What's up?

384
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,880
Is brother Zhongfu here?

385
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,200
It's in the study. I've been writing all day

386
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,680
What's the matter

387
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:09,760


388
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,320
中富兄

389
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,120
How did you come?

390
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,240
Let me discuss something with you.

391
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,880
What's up?

392
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,520
Fire that Zhang Fengzai from Peking University.

393
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,960
You remember, right?

394
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
I remember. Why?

395
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
Now I've changed.

396
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,880
He became a spy of the Metropolitan Police Department.

397
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,520
Trying to woo Yannian against you 

398
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,560
And the result?

399
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
Let Yannian ask you a lot about the gums.

400
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
Charcoal, they have an idea

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
Want to make these things public

402
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,040
What do you think?

403
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
A matter of great satisfaction.

404
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,480
But as a result.

405
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
It can be easily caused. 

406
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,040
A strong reaction from the reactionary government.

407
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
I met a dog in front of your house just now.

408
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,720
I see

409
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,040
They just sent a few cats with full feet.

410
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,040
You really don't look down on me, Chen Duxiu

411
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,040
Not brother Zhongfu

412
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
I know you're not afraid. 

413
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm not afraid either.

414
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
We are both blacklisted people.

415
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
If you have me here, you can't live without me there.

416
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
But have you thought about one thing?

417
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,600
Say if something happens to us

418
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,160
I'm sorry for your life.

419
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,920
Bear the brunt

420
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
But "New Youth"

421
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
And the Weekly Review.

422
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,920
And the student movement, which is now gaining momentum.

423
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,880
I see

424
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,280
Are you trying to tell me 

425
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
It's best to retreat now.

426
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
Don't show your face yet, right? 

427
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
Makes sense. I agree.

428
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
But I can't stay at home and have long hair.

429
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,280
I have to order something.

430
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,720
I have arranged it for you.

431
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,760
What about next week

432
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm the rotation editor of New Youth.

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
But I have too many things to do.

434
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,040
Let's take turns.

435
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,880
line

436
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,960
Eagle Zhang Fengzai confessed himself.

437
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
Now the reporter put the gate of the Metropolitan Police Department

438
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
It's all blocked.

439
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,200
How do you want me to explain it to people?

440
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,400
inspector general

441
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,000
You have to make decisions for me this time.

442
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,240
You don't know Chen Yannian's gang. 

443
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
That's a gang member!

444
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
I was beaten.

445
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
I lost my face and wrote a confession.

446
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,680
In the newspaper

447
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,000
You sold the whole police department.

448
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,720
What kind of gang members are you making up now?

449
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,320
You're so talented.

450
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
You don't know how hard they are.

451
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,720
I almost dug a hole and buried it.

452
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,400
You are a softie.

453
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
Let people frighten hiss twice. 

454
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,320
Just like this.

455
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
The reporter will be back at the gate now.

456
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
You explain it, you explain it to me. 

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
My subordinates met gang members. 

458
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,920
You can't come back if you don't say it.

459
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
Beat it into confession.

460
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,720
What do you mean?

461
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
Why don't you know yourself?

462
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,680
Gang members control the student movement.

463
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,120
Caught a newspaper reporter. 

464
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
For the journalist's life. 

465
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
Have to follow their request.

466
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
Confess to being a member of the National Police Department.

467
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,760
This is the truth.

468
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,040
confess to false charges under torture

469
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
confess to false charges under torture

470
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
It seems that this can only be the case now.

471
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,600
Come on, you made all this up

472
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,880
Write materials for me.

473
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
I gave it to Qian Nengxun as evidence.

474
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,440
Gang members colluded with the student movement. 

475
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,840
This name is good enough for them to drink a pot. 

476
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,320
inspector general

477
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,640
What are you?

478
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,080
The materials have already been prepared.

479
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
You are really a good material.

480
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,840
Director Wu Director Wu

481
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
Come on, the reporters can't stop it.

482
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Let them wait.

483
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,640
Did you see that?

484
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
I have to wipe your ass at this time. 

485
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,560
Stay away from the press. 

486
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
Shouchang Yannian told me everything.

487
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,320
You should be careful yourself these days.

488
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
Don't worry on my side, sister-in-law.

489
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,840
Now the key is brother Zhongfu's side.

490
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
You have to watch him. 

491
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,000
I see

492
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,640
Yannian

493
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,640
I also give you a task.

494
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,240
Your father is now in the government.

495
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,440
A thorn in one's side

496
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,960
You know his temperament.

497
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,320
Be sure to watch him.

498
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,880
good

499
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,040
Then I'll go back 

500
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,280
good-bye

501
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,160
Since our family has been targeted.

502
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,360
Just don't go out.

503
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,880
That won't do.

504
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
We have to call on the people to boycott Japanese goods.

505
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
What if you have something to do when you are so young? 

506
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,320
The benefits of small games

507
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,920
The police won't go after children.

508
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,920
No, stay at home.

509
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

510
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,200
看陈独秀李大钊发文

511
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,240
Angry and arrogant

512
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

513
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,640
陈独秀李大钊发文

514
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:12,880
Be angry and rude

515
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,120
Be angry and rude

516
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,920
Be angry and rude

517
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
看陈独秀李大钊发文

518
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
Be angry and rude

519
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,040
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

520
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,720
ladies and gentlemen

521
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,640
Yesterday, America, Britain, France and Italy Day

522
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,160
Ministers of several countries in China

523
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,680
A protest note was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China. 

524
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,040
And asked us to understand what happened recently.

525
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
Personal attacks on expatriates from various countries

526
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,720
Explain and make peace.

527
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,520
I'm talking about these events.

528
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,840
Today, we have to develop one.

529
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
operable

530
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,200
The operational scheme comes out.

531
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,560
Let's invite Premier Qian.

532
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
Tell everyone about the general situation.

533
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
As far as the situation in Beijing is concerned

534
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
Since the last drastic measures were taken

535
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,920
The situation has improved.

536
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
Many graduating classes in Beijing.

537
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,960
Have resumed classes to prepare for the exam.

538
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,160
There are many students.

539
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,840
Start preparing for the civil service advanced examination.

540
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,280
After the schools have an early holiday

541
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
Many students have also left Beijing.

542
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,560
but

543
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,200
The general strike in 33 schools is still going on.

544
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
Although students didn't take to the streets recently

545
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,480
Demonstrations and speeches

546
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,760
They changed their ways.

547
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,320
Boycott Japanese goods in the name of selling domestic goods

548
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,920
And encourage publicity activities.

549
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,280
There are signs that

550
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
Students are engaged in a tug of war with the government. 

551
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
Trying to drag the student movement into the normal state.

552
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,920
Hope to get the southern government

553
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,680
And other cities across the country.

554
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
To form a prairie fire.

555
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,040
If no decisive action is taken

556
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,560
It's bound to end.

557
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
As far as the whole country is concerned

558
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
Now Shanghai has implemented a general strike.

559
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,800
Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha and other places 

560
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,160
There have also been strikes.

561
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,560
Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Students Federation, etc.

562
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
Full mobilization is under way.

563
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,920
Let it go.

564
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
Shanghai is probably the same as Beijing.

565
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,560
Become the second center of the student movement

566
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,600
Students from both sides of Japan and South China meet.

567
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,720
Students from both sides of Dan River meet.

568
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,800
That would be a terrible thing.

569
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,280
Japanese ministers protested in succession.

570
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,040
The Japanese army is eager to move.

571
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Britain and America were originally neutral.

572
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
But recently, it has joined forces with Japan to oppress.

573
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,520
Signs of the Chinese government 

574
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,640
This shows the order of all countries towards Beijing.

575
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,280
Serious dissatisfaction has lost patience.

576
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,800
You two have analyzed the situation thoroughly.

577
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,320
Let me summarize.

578
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,680
first

579
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,320
The drastic measures we have taken have paid off. 

580
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
Compared with the situation before and in the middle of the month.

581
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,760
Much more relaxed.

582
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
What does it mean?

583
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,080
It shows that students are also bullying.

584
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,440
second

585
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,440
This student movement has dragged on for so long.

586
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,240
Endurance in all aspects has reached its limit. 

587
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
It's time to end it.

588
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
When you don't stop, you will suffer from chaos.

589
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
So tomorrow I will issue a presidential decree.

590
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,280
Take tough measures to force schools to resume classes. 

591
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Students are not allowed to use any name or excuse. 

592
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,720
Shangjie activity

593
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
Violator hell to pay

594
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
The specific situation is coordinated by Premier Qian.

595
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,160
Garrison headquarters, the metropolitan police department.

596
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,440
There is also a coordinated execution of the step army at the head of the door.

597
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
If you have no objection. 

598
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
We can finish the meeting.

599
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,280
President, I want to talk to you alone.

600
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,800
president

601
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
The new step army leads Wang Huaiqing.

602
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
And the garrison commander Duan Zhigui.

603
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,760
I've been waiting for you for half a day.

604
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
Let them wait.

605
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,560
be

606
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,840
president

607
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,080
Take such drastic measures now.

608
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,520
Give Wang Huaiqing back.

609
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Replace Li Changtai as the leader of the infantry.

610
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,080
I wonder if the president has considered the consequences?

611
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,200
At this meeting just now

612
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
Don't you advocate being tough? 

613
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,800
How did it change at a glance?

614
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
Do you need to be tough enough?

615
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,960
Police, gendarmes, troops together.

616
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
Brother Ju Ren

617
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
Wang Huaiqing is known as the butcher.

618
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,160
Duan Zhigui barks every day.

619
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
Ten years rather than school.

620
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,040
This style of study can't be tolerated for a day.

621
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,440
At this time, you let them join hands to direct the suppression.

622
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
It won't end well in the future

623
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
Duan Qirui insisted that

624
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,040
Wang Huaiqing and Duan Zhigui did it.

625
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
I can't help it 

626
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,440
And what about Paris?

627
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,880
It will be published tomorrow.

628
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Reject Cao Rulin Zhang Zongxiang Lu Zong

629
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,400
Presidential decree of resignation 

630
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
It's not easy to explain. 

631
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
What's the use of telling me this now?

632
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,080
Why didn't you say so at the meeting?

633
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
I only grumbled a few words in front of Brother Ju.

634
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
What else can you do?

635
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
You complain to me.

636
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't even know where to cry.

637
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,320
The country has reached this point.

638
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,080
What can we do? 

639
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,160
Take it one step at a time.

640
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,360
I can't. Let's go together.

641
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,520
Why is this army here?

642
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,280
Ah, what's going on

643
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,560
So many troops are here.

644
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,560
Get out of the way

645
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,160
No, they're going to do it.

646
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,520
We have to hurry back to the red chamber.

647
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Listen to me.

648
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,680
I'll find Mr. Shouchang. 

649
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,280
You guys get together in the library. 

650
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,840
Inform each class

651
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,200
Go, go!

652
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,400
Haiwei

653
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
Go to the front door and find Zilan.

654
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,880
They sell domestic products there.

655
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
Go quickly. Something will happen to them.

656
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:42,880


657
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:42,960


658
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,120
OK, don't worry.

659
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,440
hurry up

660
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,560
Here you are.

661
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,240
Thank you for supporting domestic products. 

662
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,760
There are toothbrushes and tooth powder.

663
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
This is canned food from Guanshengyuan.

664
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,600
Give me a support.

665
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,720
Support domestic products

666
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
Please buy a toothpaste.

667
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,560
Support domestic products

668
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,280
Give it a support.

669
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
Hello, have some domestic products.

670
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,520
Thank you

671
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,920
Safeguard sovereignty and support domestic products

672
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
Support domestic products, please.

673
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,160
Bai LanBai Lan

674
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,400


675
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,480


676
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:02,640
Bai LanBai Lan

677
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:02,720


678
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:02,800


679
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:02,880


680
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,200
自兰白兰

681
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,400
Run!

682
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,480


683
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,200
Run!

684
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,400
run for it

685
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,840
cut it

686
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,240
give me myself

687
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
He Mengxiong

688
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,320
Qunxian

689
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,120
He Mengxiong

690
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
Group, leave me alone. Let's go

691
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,520
Be honest.

692
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,320
give me myself

693
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
Why arrest me?

694
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,680
Qunxian

695
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,240
give me myself

696
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Let her go!

697
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,800
give me myself

698
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,680
give me myself

699
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,120
Qunxian

700
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,120
Qunxian

701
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,520
Tell me about the students.

702
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,840
Beijing xuelian

703
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,240
I just had a meeting in the auditorium of a normal university.

704
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,000
decide unanimously

705
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,920
Resume the large-scale speech activity tomorrow.

706
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
It is estimated that thousands of people will take to the streets.

707
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
Now all schools are preparing overnight.

708
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,840
the highest official rank in imperial China

709
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
Report the situation of Peking University to the director.

710
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,640
good

711
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,960
Students of Peking University are now making

712
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,480
Small white flag and slogan

713
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,760
Prepare for tomorrow's speech

714
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,720
According to this situation.

715
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,560
Fake and Ma Temple in the Red Mansion of Peking University

716
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,360
These three places

717
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,720
It is estimated that there will be about 500 people tomorrow.

718
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,800
These students are really not afraid of death.

719
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,640
We arrested seventy people today.

720
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,320
The detention center is full.

721
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,920
What should I do tomorrow?

722
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,960
Then don't catch it.

723
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
Of course, I will.

724
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,200
I think the red building of Peking University is fine.

725
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,720
It can hold a thousand people.

726
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
Of course, the red chamber can't be too conspicuous.

727
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,160
And those people are professors.

728
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,480
We won't be able to mess with them for a while.

729
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,960
I think it's ok for Peking University Law Department along the North River. 

730
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
It's also close there. 

731
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
Are the troops stationed in the old section of the North Riverside?

732
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
There are ten tents on each side of the school gate. 

733
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
Okay, North Riverside, then.

734
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,440
Notify Duan Zhigui and Wang Huaiqing

735
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,320
Get them ready.

736
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Let's give 70% of the police force tomorrow.

737
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,680
Post-genius is the key.

738
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm afraid we'll have to go out. 

739
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,880
leave it at that

740
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,760
be

741
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,040
Wait, wait, wait

742
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,760
Come back!

743
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,080
keep in mind

744
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
Let's get these students

745
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,920
Go back where you came from.

746
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,880
Understand?

747
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,280
It's called control, not arrest 

748
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,160
clear

749
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,040
clear

750
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,200
Go

751
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
We reclaim Qingdao's diplomacy.

752
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,760
Not because of the defeat.

753
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
It's not like encroaching on someone else's taxi land.

754
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,800
Why does the government ban it?

755
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
What about the national patriotic movement? 

756
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,560
Now we can't help but send out 

757
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,320
A pitiful voice.

758
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,480
Advise the military and police compatriots

759
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,920
It's the same root. Why rush it?

760
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,960
Keep your voice down

761
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,960
Your dad just fell asleep after writing all night last night.

762
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,440
Chen Boqiao writes really well.

763
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:43,600
Chen Bai writes really well.

764
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:43,680


765
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,320
Chen writes really well.

766
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,640
伯母我来

767
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:44,720


768
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:44,880
伯母我来

769
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,520
So many!

770
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,240
Qiaonian

771
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,040
Qiaonian

772
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,320
We went to the street today.

773
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,920
How about reading this passage to the police?

774
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,440
Well, maybe the police will be moved to tears. 

775
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:51,920
impossible

776
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
The police go to the streets to arrest and beat people. 

777
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
You two girls must not go to the streets.

778
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,200
That won't do.

779
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,800
I haven't seen any big waves before.

780
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,800
This little storm can't beat me.

781
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,760
Don't beat you.

782
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
I told you not to go out.

783
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
Nobody goes out today. 

784
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,520
I didn't sleep well all night.

785
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,800
Lao Meng Meng qun xian 

786
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,480
I don't know where she's locked up.

787
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,760
No news at all.

788
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,520
I'm so anxious.

789
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,560
Yannian

790
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,800
Keep your voice down

791
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,720
Your husband is sleeping.

792
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
Have you got the news of Qunxian? 

793
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,080
I haven't heard of it yet.

794
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,040
But I heard that

795
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,480
They seem to be locked in the metropolitan police department.

796
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
I've been to that place, and I have books to read.

797
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,400
I think Qunxian should be fine.

798
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,920
This silly child

799
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
This time the situation is different from last time.

800
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Yannian

801
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,360
李大钊先生和邓中夏

802
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,400
Let me tell you specially.

803
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,680
Never go out today.

804
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,360
Be sure to stay at home with Mr. Zhongfu.

805
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,400
Okay, okay, okay. Got it

806
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,200
Bai Lan

807
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,760
Shanghai and Guangzhou will hold a memorial service for Xingang.

808
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,120
You also prepare.

809
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,720
Okay, I got it

810
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,800
Come to Hewei and get two eggs.

811
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,920
I'll bring you some steamed stuffed buns.

812
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,440
Bring it to the students to eat. Do you hear me?

813
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,080
good

814
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,320
good

815
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:54,720


816
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:54,800


817
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,680
Please don't

818
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:55,760


819
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,360
Run to Dashilan for business when you are in danger.

820
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,360
There are too many shops to get in. 

821
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,160
Okay, okay, know

822
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,600
I've sorted everything out. 

823
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,720
Okay, okay, let's go then 

824
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,200
Ah, be careful!

825
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,520
good

826
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm leaving too.

827
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,000
I'll go too. I'll go too.

828
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,840
Qiaonian

829
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,480
You two are not allowed to go.

830
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:08,800
Haiwei

831
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,120
Haiwei

832
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,040
What's going on? You guys 

833
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,640
I thought I told you not to go out.

834
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,840
Why aren't you obedient?

835
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,120
Everybody go back!

836
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,280
go

837
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,920
Why don't I deliver steamed stuffed bun?

838
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,280
I'm still out. Stay

839
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,960
Hurry up, hurry up!

840
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,400
Why arrest us?

841
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,160
come on

842
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,280
come on

843
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,000
come on

844
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,160


845
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,320


846
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,480


847
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,200
Why push me?

848
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,640
Our actions are all patriotic.

849
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,680
What makes you push me?

850
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,400
quisling

851
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,880
Are you Chinese?

852
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,200
Are you still not Chinese?

853
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,360
cut it

854
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,280
What crime have we committed? Tell me.

855
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,320
What crime have we committed?

856
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,200
quisling

857
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,600
get in

858
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,880
Don't push me.

859
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,080
Do you still have a conscience?

860
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,680
Don't do it.

861
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,520
Give me my freedom, give me my freedom

862
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:17,280
Student prison. Student prison 

863
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,320
All of you stay here.

864
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,720
Student prison. Student prison 

865
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,760
Write another one.

866
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
Write again and write again 

867
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,280
Student prison. Student prison 

868
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,320
You belong to the dog, right? 

869
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,200
You are the dog.

870
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,600
Love China and defend China 

871
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,160
Love China and defend China 

872
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,680
What's the matter?

873
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,880
Auntie, give you a brain tonic.

874
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,040
good

875
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,840
sit down

876
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,680
Just this day, no one spoke to me. 

877
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,200
Sit down and I'll talk to you. 

878
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,080
I'll call auntie for you.

879
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,480
Just you.

880
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,560


881
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:04,640


882
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:04,720


883
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:04,800


884
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,200
Sit down, Jing. Just you.

885
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,560
I'm editing the next issue of New Youth.

886
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,560
What do you always feel short of?

887
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,480
I want to write a letter.

888
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,160
Mainly to clarify.

889
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,560
Two issues that everyone is concerned about. 

890
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
What problem?

891
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,640
In the new culture movement.

892
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,000
Debate between reformers and conservatives

893
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,680
What kind of question is it? 

894
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
Second, we reformed the old Chinese learning.

895
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,960
What is the attitude?

896
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
I'm also interested in these two questions.

897
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,520
Tell me about it.

898
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,640
be interested in

899
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,240
Well, listen to me and tell you something.

900
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,400
First, I propose

901
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,520
Debate between reformers and conservatives

902
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,240
Is a phenomenon of academic progress.

903
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,040
It's an academic dispute, not between us.

904
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,640
For example, Chen DuxiuLi Dazhao of Peking University

905
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,680
Shiluxun Qian Xuantong

906
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,440
With Gu Hongming Liu Shipei

907
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,560
The dispute between Huang and Ni 

908
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,680
It is of this nature. 

909
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,440
That's not what Huang Kan thinks. 

910
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
His language is too vicious.

911
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,400
There are different arguments. 

912
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,360
Different opinions are expressed in the debate.

913
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,840
Even the two sides will scold a few words.

914
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,040
This is normal.

915
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
Throughout the history of countries around the world

916
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,000
The development of new culture

917
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,800
Have this process.

918
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,280
Reformists and conservatives are relative. 

919
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
Today's conservatives

920
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
Maybe he used to be an innovator.

921
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,240
Today's innovators

922
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,480
Maybe become a conservative in the future.

923
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,440
There is no end to the evolution of the world.

924
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,000
So the struggle between the reformers and the conservatives

925
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,000
There is no end to it.

926
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,560
Even in another million years.

927
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,120
A foot above the road is a foot above the devil.

928
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,800
The world is innovative and conservative after all.

929
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
The world of struggle

930
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,840
Look, today, we are reformers.

931
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,840
Gu Ming, they are conservative

932
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,360
The environment will change tomorrow.

933
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,360
Maybe it will be reversed.

934
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,280
This is the historical view of evidence.

935
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,880
What do you mean?

936
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,040
Maybe one day Gu Hongming's point of view

937
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,400
May also be correct.

938
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,000
First you have to admit

939
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,960
Hongming Liu Shipei Huang Kan 

940
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,360
They are all people with specialized knowledge.

941
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,240
Secondly, even today. 

942
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,880
Some of their views are also reasonable.

943
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
Our fight with them again

944
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,800
In the final analysis, it is the need of social change. 

945
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,400
At a certain time

946
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,400
Living conditions have changed. 

947
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,080
People's understanding of the dispute between the old and the new

948
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
Will also change.

949
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,400
It will even reverse.

950
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,360
Do you understand

951
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,040
Then I understand what you said.

952
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
What's your second question?

953
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,200
the second question

954
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
We reformed the old Chinese learning.

955
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,880
What is the attitude?

956
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,640
Remember what I said today.

957
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,200
Because there may be some people in the future

958
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,320
Argue over this issue. 

959
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,240
My general opinion is that

960
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,760
Old Chinese studies

961
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Is a part of world scholarship.

962
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,160
Confucian Confucianism

963
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
It is a part of the old Chinese school.

964
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,640
Kong Sangang

965
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
Is a part of Confucianism.

966
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,680
Even a small part.

967
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,640
For the existence of value within the responsibility of Confucianism

968
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,560
We have no objection.

969
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
Wait a minute, you're going too far.

970
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
I'm a little confused.

971
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
So what exactly do you object to?

972
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,720
That's a good question.

973
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
Right? Then I'll just say it

974
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,000
We are opposed to putting some of the 

975
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,040
Part of the Three Outline of Confucianism

976
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,320
Respect for Taoism and tradition

977
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,240
We are also opposed to putting all the

978
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
All the old Chinese studies

979
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
They all stepped on each other and said nothing.

980
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,480
Why did the reformers attack the three cardinal principles of Confucianism?

981
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,520
Except that it is not suitable for the present social life.

982
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,280
This is also a very important point.

983
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
So you think so.

984
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
But Mr. Wu Yu and Mr. Yi Baisha

985
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,360
That fierce attitude.

986
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
It doesn't give people the impression you said. 

987
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
Didn't I just say that?

988
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,880
There are excesses and overcorrections in the debate. 

989
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,160
This is inevitable.

990
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,160
This letter of mine

991
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
I intend

992
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
Published in the next issue of New Youth

993
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,720
If it can't be published, you have to testify for me.

994
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,320
I, Chen Duxiu, am in the New Culture Movement.

995
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,000
What is the attitude?

996
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
I, Marie.

997
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,040
I think.

998
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,800
It doesn't matter what future generations think of us. 

999
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,920
The important thing is 

1000
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,240
Do we have a clear conscience

1001
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,800
Good point. I agree.

1002
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,600
You say that like my father said.

1003
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,480
Chen Yannian, remember

1004
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,360
About the New Culture Movement

1005
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,440
Debate between reformers and conservatives

1006
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,320
I'll only tell you this once today, just this once.

1007
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
Look, you're worried when you talk.

1008
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,760


1009
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,160
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1010
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,760
I've said everything I have to say.

1011
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,920
What's the fever?

1012
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,360
Sister Qun, I'm anxious.

1013
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,600
Wait a minute.

1014
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,960
We need to go to the bathroom.

1015
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,280
We need to go to the bathroom.

1016
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
Solve it by yourself.

1017
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
We need to go to the bathroom.

1018
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,560
classmates

1019
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,440
Girls, come here.

1020
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,640
In a circle

1021
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,720
Boys, stand up and turn around.

1022
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,160
Boys, come here.

1023
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,680
Come to Su Wu to keep Hu Jie.

1024
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,760
Snow and ice.

1025
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,440
Worry for nineteen years

1026
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,960
Be thirsty for snow and hungry for felt.

1027
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,480
Muyangbian

1028
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,640
Save the heart and the country.

1029
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,400
Still not paid back

1030
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Be in great difficulty

1031
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,520
Heart as hard as stone.

1032
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,840
Listen to the sound of building when sitting on the night jam. 

1033
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,880
Heartache in the ear

1034
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,640
Fellow workers

1035
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
Now the reactionary government 

1036
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,040
I've started to attack the students.

1037
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,000
Now they have arrested many students.

1038
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,840
Locked up in Peking University.

1039
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,240
The whole country has moved.

1040
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,720
Our workmates in Shanghai have taken to the streets.

1041
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,440
Our shop in Changxin can't fall behind.

1042
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,440
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind

1043
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,280
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind

1044
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,520
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind

1045
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,480
Can't lag behind

1046
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,000
The vast number of workers and friends

1047
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,720
The workers in Shanghai don't just take to the streets.

1048
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
People have issued a strike declaration.

1049
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,040
Errenjia

1050
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,440
We are also going to set up a workers' organization.

1051
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
To lead this social movement

1052
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,520
Workers, think about it.

1053
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,040
The working class stands on China's political stage.

1054
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,240
This is an epoch-making event.

1055
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
So I appeal to everyone.

1056
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
We should also act quickly.

1057
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,400
We should also stand at the forefront of this movement.

1058
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,440
okay

1059
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,160
good

1060
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,280
寿昌先生

1061
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,360


1062
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,200
寿昌先生

1063
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,720
Zhong lai

1064
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:56,800


1065
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,400
Friends!

1066
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,360
Quiet, everybody, quiet.

1067
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,040
Let's listen to Zhong Jie.

1068
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,520
The situation brought about by the meeting of the students' association

1069
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,640
Go ahead, please.

1070
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,960
Fellow workers, fellow masters

1071
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,400
Today is the craziest day for reactionaries.

1072
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,160
Until before.

1073
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,520
We already have about

1074
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,520
More than a thousand students were arrested. 

1075
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,600
These classmates are now being held in

1076
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,040
Law and science of Peking University

1077
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,200
There is no water, no food.

1078
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,960
No guarantee at all.

1079
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,320
So the Federation of Students decided

1080
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,440
start from tomorrow

1081
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,960
Put the goal of struggle

1082
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,920
Turn into an all-out rescue for the arrested classmates. 

1083
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,280
We need to electrify the whole country.

1084
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,440
Use all available means. 

1085
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,600
Force the reactionary government to let them release people.

1086
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,520
Now the Federation of Students is preparing the declaration.

1087
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,120
And prepare for tomorrow morning.

1088
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,120
Organize five thousand students.

1089
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
March on the streets together in three ways.

1090
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,080
These five thousand students will be in dressing the tomorrow. 

1091
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,400
Carry your own bags and dry food.

1092
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,120
They asked that they must communicate with their arrested classmates.

1093
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,160
Go to jail together.

1094
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,360
The rest of the students

1095
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,560
School-based

1096
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,320
Self-organized to the Ministry of Education 

1097
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,760
The Presidential Palace Police Department went to sit-in demonstration. 

1098
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
Ask them to release the arrested classmates.

1099
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,440
I have four copies of our rules.

1100
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,840
I'll send it to you later. 

1101
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,320
Fellow workers and masters

1102
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,760
these two days

1103
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,880
We have hundreds of classmates in Peking University. 

1104
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,120
Be violently arrested

1105
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,880
Students from No.1 Middle School and No.4 Middle School tomorrow

1106
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,240
Will also help us.

1107
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,680
Now we urgently need your help and help.

1108
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
Guys, I suggest

1109
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,440
The meeting broke up after a while.

1110
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
Take each branch factory as a unit.

1111
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,240
Everyone is going to take to the streets to support students.

1112
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,120
And go to the presidential palace to petition.
