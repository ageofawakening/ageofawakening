[Episode Thirty-two]

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,640
Yannian

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,280
Facts are facts.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,280
Face it or not,

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,200
you decide.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,880
Come in.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Yannian

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,000
Greetings.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,160
Why you are here?

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
I heard that you were beaten and hospitalized.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,600
How are you now?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,200
Thank you, sir. I'm fine now.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
My sudden visit disturbed you writing. 

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,840
It's all good.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,200
The students went on strike.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,560
I have nothing to do either,

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,160
might as well practice my handwriting.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
My style of calligraphy

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,680
it was influenced by the master Chou Laizhi from Nanjing.

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,440
Using the long-haired soft Chinese brush.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
But I still hold my wrist properly.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,920
So your father often criticizes me. 

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
That my handwriting is too vulgar.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,160
So now,

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
I used a dozen of paper for practise every day.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,160
He enjoys criticizing people.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
You don't need take his words seriously.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,640
Come and sit.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
Help me bring this up.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,360
Come and sit.

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,120
Yannian, you came to me.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,560
Is it for my confession?

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,000
Why do you say that?

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,680
Not long ago,

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,880
there is rumors everywhere accusing your father's immoral behaviours. 

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
People talked a lot about it.

38
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
Tang Erhe said to Mr. Cai 

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
that to cancel the senior of department system,

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,320
remove Zhongfu from the post of liberal arts senior.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,840
I seconded the motion at that time.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
I do regret it.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
I feel I did Zhongfu wrong.

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
Yannian, if that

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
affected your family.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
I am willing to make amends to you.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,960
Sir

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,800
Please don't do this. Please sit down.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
It's not about that.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
Someone gave me some materials the other day,

51
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
said that you and principal Tang are insiders.

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,960
So I figured

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
I'd check about it with you face to face.

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,760
Someone made this up on purpose.

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,400
Untrustworthy.

56
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,680
Indeed, Zhongfu has been at the forefront.

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
This is a fact.

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,040
His <New Youth> has made a reputation out there,

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
too much influence for his own good.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Those who oppose it will surely want to put him down.

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,120
To achieve this goal,

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
they'd go to the extreme.

63
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,560
Then, does Principal Tang knows

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,000
the truth of this matter?

65
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
Tang Erhe should also know

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
that this is a deliberate rumor.

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
Because your father once scolded Tong Erhe and

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
he was wrong that time, he couldn't face that,

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
so he just avoided it all.

70
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Then why did you and Principal Tang propose it?

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,960
To bring the senior system to an early closure.

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,360
Yannian, since you asked

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,840
I'll have a good talk with you about it.

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm from the same town as Mr Cai.

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm standing in his shoes regarding this issue.

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,720
Your father is a honest man with a blunt character.

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,320
He offended many people,

78
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,160
which made him a target of public criticism.

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
For Peking University and President Cai,

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,800
he is a troublemaker.

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Since it has been proposed to abolish the senior system. 

82
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
It's better to execute it earlier.

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,320
So Mr. Cai won't be embarrassed too much.

84
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
Of course, I have my own agenda too. 

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,880
Zhongfu can't control his temper or his mouth.

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
He often makes it difficult for me in public.

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
I don't want him to be my immediate superior.

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,200
This is my selfishness.

89
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Yannian, it's good you came.

90
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,360
So I can use this chance to speak my mind.

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
These days, because of my selfishness

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
I couldn't sleep well and regretted it a lot.

93
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
Now,

94
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,200
I can't even visit the editorial department of New Youth. 

95
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
I can only hide here and practice my handwriting.

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,600
Sir, don't blame yourself too much.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,080
What you said are of great use to me.

98
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,080
Do you think I should go to see Principal Tang, 

99
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,080
ask Principal Tang about this?

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
Principal Tang should have the same feeling.

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
It's all for Mr. Cai's sake.

102
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
And he does have a grudge against your father.

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,160
It's no use asking him.

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,920
I do remember.

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
Hu Shizhi specifically investigated this matter.

106
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
And refuted Tang Erhe.

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,080
In that case.

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
Those materials can't be trusted.

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Good

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
Thank you, sir. I'll be going now.

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,600
Goodbye.

112
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,920
Chen Yannian

113
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
You look like you're deep in your mind.

114
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,960
Chen Yannian, are you still not well?

115
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
Why don't I talk to the nurse,

116
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,600
they might give you another day, and we'll stay.

117
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
You mouth vanished?

118
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Or is it sequelae?

119
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Can't talk now?

120
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
I'm talking to you, do you hear me? 

121
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
My brain is now

122
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
more awake than ever.

123
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,920
Auntie

124
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,800
It's packed.

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Liu mei, I had a rickshaw at the door.

126
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
Let's put the luggage on first.

127
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,920
Yannian

128
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,840
You finish the paper there, it's not done.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Okay, okay, okay

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
Leave it, you just got out.

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll do it. I'll do it

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
I'll do it. I can do it. 

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,280
Mrs Chen

134
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,320
Please sign your name.

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,080
If a gentleman named Zhang comes to me 

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Please forward this letter to him.

137
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,080
come on

138
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,840
What about luggage?

139
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,360
Liu Mei took it all out.

140
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,640
Ah, brother

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
Why did you make an appointment at such a place? 

142
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,640
It's on the moutain,

143
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
and quite far away.

144
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
It made me nervous for a while.

145
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
How's your head? Are you feeling better?

146
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
All healed.

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,320
That's good

148
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
How about that? Have you verified it?

149
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,440
Am I lying?

150
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
I went to both of them.

151
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
It's just like you said.

152
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Honestly, when I first found out about this,

153
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
I was so angry that I almost fainted 

154
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
What are you going to do, brother? 

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
What can I do?

156
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,040
I'm taking my little brother to France.

157
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
We are leaving from all the mess here.

158
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
You are leaving?

159
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,360
This is not you, Chen Yannian.

160
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
What do you suggest I do?

161
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,000
I think

162
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
You should at least step out. 

163
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,960
Persuade your father to admit his mistake,

164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
be a good man again.

165
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
Stop him from making more influence and making it worse

166
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,600
for the reputation of this student movement.

167
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
Chen Duxiu, if he can ever take my advice,

168
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
that is not him.

169
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,760
He's been like this all his life, and he can't change it.

170
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Then we have all the reasons to

171
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
Tell the truth to the people.

172
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
What you said earlier,

173
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,120
that if people knows about this,

174
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
it'll be a devastating blow to the student movement.

175
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,160
Right

176
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,840
And now you're saying

177
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
we should make this public. 

178
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,880
You are against your own words now.

179
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
No, no, it's not contradictory at all.

180
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,920
Brother, there is no new start without break the old.

181
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
Instead of let Chen Duxiu

182
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
destory the student movement.

183
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Why don't we overthrow him first and seek another leader? 

184
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,040
Another leader

185
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,760
Who will that be?

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
In Peking University, in the Academic Union,

187
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,600
there are so many respected professors.

188
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
Anyone can do it. 

189
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,680
Okay, that makes sense.

190
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,520
Then let me get this straight.

191
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
What's in it for me?

192
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
What?

193
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
I can't believe you want benefits.

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,280
I have seen it now, 

195
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,640
what kind of man Chen Duxiu really is. 

196
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
Patriotic student movement?

197
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
It's a joke.

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
Now that I have decided to go to France.

199
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,840
Then I must plan for myself in the future.

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Well

201
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,720
You changed your heart faster than I thought.

202
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
I need time to adapt.

203
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,080
What do you mean?

204
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,800
It's that..

205
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
Suit yourself then.

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
I didn't say no to offer you something.

207
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,360
So

208
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
if you and Chen Qiaonian

209
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,680
sign this statement.

210
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
As soon as it's on the newspaper tomorrow,

211
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
I'll help you two right away.

212
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
I will make sure all procedures for studying in France done smoothly.

213
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
What do you say?

214
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,200
What signature can be this valuable? 

215
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,560
Here

216
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,920
this is a statement to expose Chen Duxiu's moral corruption

217
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,480
and to disown him.

218
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,240
Don't worry.

219
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
This is the right thing to do.

220
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
It will never affect the image of you two brothers.

221
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
Are you serious about this?

222
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes.

223
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,080
OK, I can sign this.

224
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
But you have to promise me two conditions.

225
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
Say it.

226
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,080
First, studying abroad will be at official expense. 

227
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,360
This is no problem.

228
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,760
Second, give me 500 dollars.

229
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Dude, you are asking for too much.

230
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,920
If you can promise

231
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
I can sign this now.

232
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
Don't hesitate.

233
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
Okay, I promise.

234
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,160
Words are empty.

235
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
Write it down,I can't just rely on your words.

236
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,280
Liu Mei set me up just a few days ago.

237
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
You want to set me up again?

238
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
You think me as a fool?

239
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
Let me tell you something, Chen Yannian

240
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
No way I will write it down.

241
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,560
If you want to do this,

242
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,080
this time tomorrow 

243
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
this place.

244
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
I promise you five hundred dollars.

245
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,040
As for studying in France.

246
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,200
That's a lot to do, give me two days.

247
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,800
But I promise.

248
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
I, Zhang Fengzai keep my word.

249
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,440
Stay away!

250
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
Guo only passed away not long ago.

251
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
I am finishing this bastard today for him.

252
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,560
Calm down

253
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,440
What are you doing?

254
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,720
We're all classmates. Don't get violent.

255
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,080
Violent?

256
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,960
I told you so.

257
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,920
We should just go for the hard way.

258
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
Chen Yannian, hoe can you do this?

259
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,280
You brothers are making a deal with him

260
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
in front of us now, aren't you?

261
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,760
What deal?

262
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
Lao He, no need talking to him.

263
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,080
Just do it.

264
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,040
Wait!

265
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,760
Come here!

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,880
What's the situation?

267
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,560
What show are you playing?

268
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,160
Good cop and bad cop?

269
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Good or bad

270
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
Today, I am the mad cop.

271
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
Kill you with no reason!

272
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,840
I dare you.

273
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
Do you know who I am?

274
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,360
I don't care!

275
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm telling you.

276
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,520
I'm the Deputy head of the intelligence unit

277
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,200
in metropolitan police department.

278
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,000
I dare you to lay one finger on me.

279
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,000
Come and aim here.

280
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,520
If I even blink,

281
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
I'll start calling you Daddy.

282
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,840
Ok, son!

283
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Daddy's gonna give you a hiding! 

284
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
I got a letter from home.

285
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
Tomorrow I'm going back to Shandong to get married.

286
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,480
Since I'm leaving, I will finish this now.

287
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,680
Kill you here,

288
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,440
so Guo can have a companion down there!

289
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,160
Step aside

290
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
A companion for Guo will be Bai Lan. 

291
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,400
What do you want with me?

292
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
Take this, son.

293
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,640
Kneel.

294
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,120
Hands down.

295
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Come down and kneel.

296
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,680
Yannian, say something, Yannian

297
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
He has promised to write it down.

298
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,080
Isn't it, Zhang Fengzai?

299
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,040
Yes, yes, yes

300
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
I'll write it now. I'll write it right away.

301
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
You two dig a hole. Go

302
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,280
Go, dig a hole now.

303
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
Don't hurt anyone.

304
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Don't make it nasty.

305
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,800
Come on, guys.

306
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
Don't hurt anyone, don't kill anyone.

307
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,040
Yannian

308
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Yannian, say something, Yannian

309
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
You two stay away.

310
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,880
I don't want to spill blood all on you.

311
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
Don't kill anyone. 

312
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,080
What happened today.

313
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,960
Write it all down clearly for me.

314
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,080
Okay, I'll write. I'll write

315
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,280
If you dare to leave a word behind,

316
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,480
your leg will be left behind too!

317
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,880
I write, I write.

318
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:48,960


319
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,680
I write, I write.

320
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,480
Fast.

321
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
Write, I write, I write, I write right away. 

322
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,560
I'm writing it, Yannian

323
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
Stop digging, Yannian. I'm writing it.

324
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,120
Take a break, Yannian

325
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,920
Write it.

326
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Fine, fine.

327
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,720
No killing.

328
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
I remember

329
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,360
When that night

330
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
around eleven o'clock or twelve o'clock

331
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Exactly what time?

332
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,520
Half past eight!

333
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,480
Yeah, yeah,

334
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,400
At 8: 30, we and Yannian

335
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,920
half past eight

336
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,320
Don't laugh, dig.

337
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,840
We need to act till it's done.

338
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,800
Such an important matter.

339
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,080
Why you guys did it

340
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,960
without discussion?

341
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,400
How dangerous it is in case something happens!

342
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,680
We thought that

343
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,880
Mr. Zhongfu can't know about it.

344
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm afraid with his temper, he might make a scene.

345
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,400
Now this fight has entered

346
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,440
White-hot stage

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
The reactionary government took all kinds of methods

348
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,200
to divide and defeat the general strike.

349
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,640
Many teachers and students has took their side.

350
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,640
You should report this situation to the Federation of Students at once.

351
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
Let them think about countermeasures.

352
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,440
At the same time.

353
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
we need prepare everyone for large-scale repression.

354
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440
Ok, Zhong Xie and I will go to the meeting of the Federation of Students later.

355
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
We want to publish Zhang Fengzai's statement

356
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
on few different papers.

357
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,600
Do you think it's feasible?

358
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,400
Yes.

359
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,680
At this time, we have to take tit for tat actions. 

360
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,960
According to Zhang Fengzai

361
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,640
The police department has included you and Mr. Zhongfu 

362
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
in the investigation list.

363
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
They also submitted applications to the presidential palace

364
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,280
to ban the National and Weekly Review

365
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
and other papers.

366
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,680
You must be cautious now.

367
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,280
Go ahead and get busy.

368
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
Yannian, we go see your father.

369
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,960
Grinding scissors

370
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,920
Sharpening kitchen knife

371
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,760
Grinding scissors

372
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,280
kitchen knife

373
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,120
Grinding scissors

374
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,400
Kitchen knife

375
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
kitchen knife

376
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,880
Grinding scissors

377
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
You need to put...

378
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,000
Shouchang is here.

379
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,200
What's up?

380
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,880
Is brother Zhongfu home?

381
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,200
In the study, hesbeen writing all day.

382
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,680
What's the matter

383
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,320
Brother Zhongfu

384
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,120
Why did you come?

385
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,240
To discuss something with you.

386
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,880
What's up?

387
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,520
Zhang Fengzai, the one got expelled from Peking University.

388
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,960
You remember him, right?

389
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
I remember. Why?

390
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
He has turned that around.

391
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,880
Now a spy for the Metropolitan Police Department.

392
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,520
He tried to woo Yannian against you. 

393
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,560
And the result?

394
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
Yannian found out a lot inside dirt.

395
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
Shiyan and the others have an idea.

396
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
They want to make these things public.

397
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,040
What do you think?

398
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
A matter of great satisfaction.

399
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,480
But as a result,

400
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
it can lead to 

401
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,040
a strong reaction from the reactionary government.

402
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
I saw too many strangers outside your house just now.

403
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,720
I know.

404
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,040
Those incapable ones they send to here.

405
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,040
They really don't know who they are dealing with.

406
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,040
Brother Zhongfu

407
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
I know you're not afraid. 

408
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm not afraid either.

409
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
We are both on the blacklist.

410
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
If they are here, they are surely at my place too.

411
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
But have you thought about one thing?

412
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,600
Say if something happens to us

413
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,160
we can face our death without hesitation.

414
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,920
But what also will be under attack,

415
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
is <New Youth>

416
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
<Weekly Review>,

417
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,920
and the student movement, which is on the fast track now.

418
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,880
I see

419
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,280
You are trying to tell me 

420
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
that it's best we take a step back

421
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
and hide ourselves, right? 

422
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
That makes sense. I agree.

423
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
But I can't stay at home 24/7.

424
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,280
I have to do something.

425
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,720
I have arranged it for you.

426
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,760
Next week,

427
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm the rotation editor of New Youth.

428
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
But I have too many things to do.

429
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,040
Why don't you take it?

430
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,880
Fine.

431
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,960
Minion Zhang Fengzai confessed himself.

432
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
Now the reporters are flooding 

433
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
gate of the Metropolitan Police Department.

434
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,200
How do you want me to explain it to people?

435
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,400
Chief.

436
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,000
You have to help me this time.

437
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,240
You have no idea, Chen Yannian and his people

438
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
they are like gangsters.

439
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
You were beaten.

440
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
You lost dignity, you wrote the confession.

441
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,680
You made it to the paper.

442
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,000
You sold out the whole police department.

443
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,720
And you are making up this gangster bullshit now?

444
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,320
You're talented, aren't you.

445
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
You don't know how scary they were.

446
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,720
I was almost buried.

447
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,400
You are such a puss.

448
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
A few threatening words

449
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,320
and you are like this.

450
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
The reporters are out there now.

451
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
You explain it, you do it. 

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
I encountered with gang members. 

453
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,920
If I didn't write those, I couldn't have made it back alive.

454
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
A forced confession.

455
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,720
What do you mean?

456
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
You can't see?

457
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,680
Gang members controlled the student movement,

458
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,120
caught a newspaper reporter. 

459
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
The reporter, hoping to stay alive,

460
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
had to do as they said,

461
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
and confessed to being a member of the National Police Department.

462
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,760
This is the truth.

463
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,040
A forced confession.

464
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
A forced confession.

465
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
It seems that this can only be the case now.

466
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,600
Come on, you made all this up.

467
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,880
Write materials for me.

468
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
I will hand to Qian Nengxun as evidence.

469
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,440
Gang members colluded with the student movement. 

470
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,840
This kind of accusation can keep them busy for a while.

471
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,320
Inspector general

472
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,640
What's this?

473
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,080
I already prepared the materials.

474
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
You are talented afterall.

475
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,840
Director Wu Director Wu

476
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
Hurry, we can't stop the reporters anymore.

477
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Let them wait.

478
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,640
Did you see that?

479
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
I have to wipe your ass this time. 

480
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,560
Stay away from the press, don't let reporters see you. 

481
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
Shouchang, Yannian told me everything.

482
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,320
You should be careful yourself these days.

483
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
Don't worry about my.

484
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,840
Brother Zhongfu is crucial this time.

485
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
You have to keep an eye on him. 

486
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,000
I see

487
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,640
Yannian

488
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,640
I'm giving you a task.

489
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,240
Your father is now the No.1 target

490
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,440
in the government's eye.

491
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,960
You know how he's like.

492
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,320
Be sure to watch him.

493
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,880
Yes.

494
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,040
Then I'll leave.

495
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,280
Take care.

496
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,160
Since our family has been targeted.

497
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,360
You just stay in.

498
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,880
That won't do.

499
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
We have to call on the people to boycott Japanese goods.

500
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
You are only a teenage, what if something happens to you?

501
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,320
There is benefit.

502
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,920
The police won't go after a teenage.

503
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,920
No, stay at home.

504
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
Newspapers!

505
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,200
Articles from Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao!

506
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,240
Anger towards Obata's arrogance.

507
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Newspapers!

508
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,640
Articles from Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao!

509
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,920
Anger towards Obata's arrogance.

510
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Articles from Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao!

511
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
Anger towards Obata's arrogance.

512
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,040
Newspapers! 

513
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,720
Gentlemen

514
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,640
Yesterday, America, Britain, France and Italy

515
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,160
their ambassdors have sent

516
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,680
a protest note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

517
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,040
Requested for explanation and apology

518
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
for all the personal attacks on expatriates from various countries

519
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,720
happened recently.

520
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,520
Everyone.

521
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,840
Today, we have to develop 

522
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
a practical scheme

523
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,200
to deal with this situation.

524
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,560
Please, Premier Qian.

525
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
Update everyone about the general situation.

526
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
As for the situation in Beijing,

527
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
since the strict measures were taken

528
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,920
things has improved here.

529
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
Many graduating classes in Beijing

530
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,960
have resumed classes to prepare for the exam.

531
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,160
There are many students

532
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,840
preparing for the civil service advanced examination.

533
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,280
After the schools have an early holiday

534
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
many students have also left Beijing.

535
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,560
However,

536
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,200
The general strike in 33 schools is still going on.

537
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
Although students stopped demonstrtations and speeches

538
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,480
on the streets recently.

539
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,760
They changed methods.

540
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,320
Boycotting Japanese goods in the name of selling domestic goods,

541
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,920
encouraging publicity activities.

542
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,280
There are signs that

543
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
students are engaged in a tug of war with the government. 

544
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
They are trying to turn the student movement into a normal state.

545
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,920
Hope to get the support from the southern government

546
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,680
and other cities across the country

547
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
to form a united force.

548
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,040
If no decisive action is taken

549
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,560
this will grow out of control.

550
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
Throughout the whole country,

551
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
Shanghai has implemented a general strike.

552
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,800
In Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha and other places, 

553
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,160
there have also been strikes.

554
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,560
Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Students Federation

555
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
is planning a full mobilization.

556
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,920
If it carries on like this,

557
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
Shanghai is highly likely to become the second center of the student movement

558
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,560
just like Beijing.

559
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,720
Once the movement from North and South join each other,

560
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,800
it will lead to terrible situation.

561
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,280
Japanese ambassdor protested multiple times.

562
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,040
The Japanese army is eager to move.

563
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Britain, America and France were originally neutral.

564
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
But recently, there's sign of them joining forces with Japan

565
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,520
to oppress Chinese government. 

566
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,640
This shows that these countries have lost patience and are holding dissatisfaction

567
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,280
on the current situation in Beijing.

568
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,800
You two have analyzed the situation thoroughly.

569
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,320
Let me summarize.

570
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,680
First,

571
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,320
the strict measures we have taken have paid off. 

572
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
Comparing the current situation with before,

573
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,760
it's more relaxed now.

574
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
What does it mean?

575
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,080
It shows that students fear.

576
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,440
Second,

577
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,440
this student movement has went on for too long.

578
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,240
Endurance in all aspects has reached its limit. 

579
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
It's time to end it.

580
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
IF we don't behave, we will suffer from chaos.

581
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
So tomorrow I will issue a presidential decree.

582
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,280
Take tough measures to force schools to resume classes. 

583
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Students are not allowed to use any excuse

584
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
to protest on street.

585
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
Who do not obey will be punished severely.

586
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
Premier Qian will be coordinating the general operation.

587
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,160
The metropolitan police department,

588
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,440
Garrison headquarters will carry the execution work.

589
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
If no one objects,

590
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
this meeting is over now.

591
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,280
President, a word alone please.

592
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,800
President

593
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
The new Army General Wang Huaiqing.

594
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
and the Garrison Commander Duan Zhigui

595
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,760
been waiting for you for long.

596
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
Let them wait.

597
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,560
Yes

598
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,840
President

599
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,080
With this kind of drastic measures,

600
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,520
and having Wang Huaiqing 

601
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
replace Li Changtai as the general,

602
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,080
have you considered the consequences?

603
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,200
Just now,

604
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
didn't you advocate being tough? 

605
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,800
How come that changed at a glance?

606
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
Yes, though do we need to adopt such drastic approach?

607
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,960
Police, gendarmes, troops all together.

608
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
Brother Ju Ren

609
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
Wang Huaiqing is known as the butcher.

610
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,160
Duan Zhigui always says that

611
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
10 years with no schools

612
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,040
is better than one more day of what's going on now.

613
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,440
Having this two join hands to direct the suppression,

614
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
it might get out of hang at the end.

615
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
Duan Qirui insisted that

616
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,040
Wang Huaiqing and Duan Zhigui should be in charge.

617
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
There is nothing I can do.

618
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,440
And what about Paris?

619
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,880
Tomorrow, the presidential decree will be out

620
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
that Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang and Lu Zongyu's resignation

621
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,400
are not granted.

622
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
Public opinions will be all over us.

623
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
What's the use of telling me this now?

624
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,080
Why didn't you say so at the meeting?

625
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
Other than complaining in front of Brother Juren,

626
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
what else can I do?

627
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
You have me to complain to,

628
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't even know who I have for that.

629
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,320
This country is at the point of no return,

630
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,080
there's nothing much that we can do.

631
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,160
We just have to wait and see.

632
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,360
Worst comes to worst, we will just piss off.

633
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,520
Why are soldiers here?

634
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,280
Ah, what's going on

635
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,560
So many troops are here.

636
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,560
Get out of the way

637
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,160
Damn, they are on the move.

638
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,520
We have to hurry back to the red chamber.

639
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Listen to me.

640
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,680
I'll find Mr. Shouchang. 

641
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,280
You guys go to the library. 

642
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,840
Inform each class.

643
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,200
Go, go!

644
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,400
Haiwei

645
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
Go to Qian Men and find Bailan.

646
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,880
They are selling domestic products there.

647
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
Go quickly. Those soldiers will go after them.

648
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,120
OK, don't worry.

649
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,440
Hurry up

650
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,560
Here you are.

651
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,240
Thank you for supporting domestic products. 

652
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,760
There are toothbrushes and tooth powder.

653
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
This is canned food from Guanshengyuan.

654
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,600
Please support us.

655
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,720
Support domestic products

656
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
Please buy a toothpaste.

657
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,560
Support domestic products

658
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,280
Please.

659
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
Hello, fancy some domestic products?

660
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,520
Thank you

661
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,920
Protect our sovereignty and support domestic products.

662
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
Support domestic products, please.

663
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Bai Lan, Bai Lan!

664
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,400
Run!

665
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,480


666
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,400
Run!

667
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Let go of me!

668
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
He Mengxiong!

669
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,320
Qunxian

670
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,120
He Mengxiong

671
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
Leave me, run!

672
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,520
Get down.

673
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,320
Let go of me.

674
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
Why arrest me?

675
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,680
Qunxian

676
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,240
Let go!

677
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Let her go!

678
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,680
Let go of me.

679
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,120
Qunxian

680
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,120
Qunxian

681
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,520
Tell me about the students.

682
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,840
Beijing Federation of students

683
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,240
just had a meeting in the auditorium of Normal University.

684
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,000
They decided unanimously

685
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,920
to resume the large-scale speech activity tomorrow.

686
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
It is estimated that thousands of people will take to the streets.

687
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
Now all schools are preparing for it overnight.

688
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,840
Yipin

689
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
Report the situation of Peking University to the director.

690
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,640
Yes

691
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,960
Students of Peking University are now making

692
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,480
flags and slogans,

693
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,760
preparing for tomorrow's speech.

694
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,720
From what we know,

695
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,560
the Red Chamber of Peking University, Fa Ke and Ma Shen Temple, 

696
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,360
in these three places alone,

697
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,720
there will be about 500 people tomorrow.

698
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,800
These students are really not afraid of death.

699
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,640
We arrested seventy people today.

700
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,320
The detention center is full.

701
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,920
What should we do tomorrow?

702
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,960
Halt for tomorrow?

703
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
No, proceed .

704
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,200
We can take the red chamber in Peking University.

705
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,720
That place can hold a thousand people.

706
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
No way, that will attract too much attention.

707
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,160
There are professors too.

708
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,480
We can't afford to mess with them for now.

709
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,960
We can take Peking University Law School by Bei River though.

710
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
Not far away.

711
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
Are General Duan's troops stationed there?

712
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
There are ten tents on each side of the school gate. 

713
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
Okay, that's it then.

714
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,440
Notify Duan Zhigui and Wang Huaiqing

715
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,320
Get them ready.

716
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Assign 70% of the police force out for tomorrow.

717
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,680
Day after the tomorrow is the big one,

718
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
all hands on deck.

719
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,880
That's all.

720
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,760
Yes

721
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,040
Wait, wait, wait

722
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,760
Come back!

723
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,080
Keep in mind

724
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
We want these students

725
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,920
to go back to where they come from.

726
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,880
Understand?

727
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,280
It's called control, not arrest. 

728
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,160
clear

729
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,040
clear

730
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,200
Go

731
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
We want to take Qingdao back.

732
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,760
We aren't the one who lost this war.

733
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
We didn't invade other's land.

734
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,800
Then why is this government banning 

735
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
the national patriotic movement? 

736
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,560
Now we can't help but send out 

737
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,320
a pitiful voice.

738
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,480
To the military and police compatriots,

739
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,920
we are the same people, we share the same root, why going after us?

740
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,960
Keep your voice down

741
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,960
Your dad just fell asleep after writing all night.

742
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Uncle Chen's words are truly powerful.

743
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Let me.

744
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,520
So many!

745
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,240
Qiaonian

746
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,040
Qiaonian

747
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,320
How about we go to the street today,

748
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,920
reading this passage to the police?

749
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,440
Well, maybe the police will be moved to tears. 

750
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:51,920
No.

751
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
The police are now arresting and beating people. 

752
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
You two must not go to the streets.

753
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,200
No.

754
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,800
I have seen worse.

755
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm not bending.

756
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,760
Nevertheless.

757
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
I said you are not going out.

758
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
Nobody goes out today. 

759
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,520
I couldn't sleep well last night.

760
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,800
Kept dreaming of Qun xian 

761
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,480
I don't even know where she's locked up.

762
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,760
No news at all.

763
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,520
I'm so anxious.

764
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,560
Yannian

765
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,800
Keep your voice down

766
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,720
Your teacher is sleeping.

767
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
Any news of Qunxian? 

768
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,080
Nothing.

769
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,040
But I heard that

770
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,480
they might be in the metropolitan police department.

771
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
I've been to there, had books to read.

772
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,400
I think Qunxian should be fine.

773
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,920
You silly child

774
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
This time the situation is different from last time.

775
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Yannian

776
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,360
Mr. Li Dazhao and Deng Zhongxia

777
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,400
asked me to inform you

778
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,680
Don't go out today.

779
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,360
Be sure to stay at home with Mr. Zhongfu.

780
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,400
Okay, okay, okay. Got it

781
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,200
Bai Lan

782
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,760
Shanghai and Guangzhou will hold a memorial service for Xingang.

783
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,120
You should prepare.

784
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,720
Okay, I got it

785
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,800
Haiewei, take two eggs.

786
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,920
I'll bring you some steamed buns.

787
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,440
Bring it to the students to eat. Do you hear me?

788
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,320
Yes

789
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:54,720


790
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:54,800


791
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,680
Don't play hard core now.

792
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:55,760


793
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,360
Run to Dashilan if you are in danger.

794
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,360
There are too many shops there, the horse raid can't get in. 

795
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,160
Okay, okay, know

796
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,600
All sorted.

797
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,720
Okay, okay, let's go then 

798
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,200
Ah, be careful!

799
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,520
Good

800
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm going too.

801
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,000
I'll go too. I'll go too.

802
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,840
Qiaonian

803
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,480
You two can't go.

804
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,120
Haiwei

805
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,040
What are you doing?

806
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,640
I told you not to go out.

807
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,840
Why you not listen.

808
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,120
Go back!

809
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,280
go

810
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,920
Why don't I deliver steamed bun for you?

811
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,280
No way, stay here.

812
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,960
Hurry.

813
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,400
Why arrest us?

814
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,160
come on

815
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,280
come on

816
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,000
come on

817
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,160


818
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,320


819
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,480


820
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,200
Why push me?

821
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,640
Our actions are all patriotic.

822
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,680
Why you push me?

823
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,400
Traitors.

824
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,880
Are you Chinese?

825
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,200
Are you still Chinese?

826
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,360
Cut it.

827
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,280
What crime have we committed? Tell me.

828
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,320
What crime have we committed?

829
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,200
Traitors.

830
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,600
Get in

831
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,880
Don't push me.

832
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,080
Do you still have a conscience?

833
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,680
Quiet.

834
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,520
Give me my freedom, give me my freedom

835
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:17,280
Student prison. Student prison 

836
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,320
Quiet you all.

837
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,720
Student prison. Student prison 

838
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,760
Write another one.

839
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
Another one.

840
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,280
Student prison. Student prison 

841
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,320
Are you a dog? 

842
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,200
You are the dog here.

843
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,600
Love China and defend China 

844
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,160
Love China and defend China 

845
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,680
What's the matter?

846
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,880
Auntie prepared this.

847
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,040
Okay

848
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,840
Sit down

849
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,680
I haven't talk to someone in the whole day.

850
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,200
Sit down, let's talk.

851
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,080
I'll call auntie for you.

852
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,200
I want you, sit down.

853
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,560
I'm editing the next issue of New Youth.

854
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,560
I can't help but feeling something is missing.

855
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,480
I want to write a letter.

856
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,160
Mainly to clarify,

857
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,560
two issues that everyone is concerned about. 

858
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
What is it?

859
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,640
First, in the new culture movement,

860
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,000
how do we define the debate

861
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,680
between reformers and conservatives.

862
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
Second, what is us reformers' view

863
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,960
on the traditional Chinese education.

864
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
I'm also interested in these two questions.

865
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,520
Pleae tell me more.

866
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,640
Interested?

867
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,240
Well, this is what I think.

868
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,400
First, I think

869
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,520
this debate between reformers and conservatives

870
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,240
is a phenomenon of academic progress.

871
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,040
It's an academic dispute, not a fight.

872
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,640
For example, Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao

873
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,680
Hu Shi, Lu Xun and Qian Xuantong of Peking University.

874
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,440
Their dispute with Gu Hongming, Liu Shipei

875
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,560
and Huang Kai,

876
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,680
it is of such nature.

877
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,440
That's not what Huang Kan thinks. 

878
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
His language is vicious.

879
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Arguments, opinions, they can get bit aggressive in a debate.

880
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,840
The two sides even scold sometimes.

881
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,040
This is normal.

882
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
Throughout the history of countries around the world

883
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,800
This process exists in the development of new culture.

884
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,280
Reformists and conservatives are relatively figures. 

885
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
A conservative today

886
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
could be a reformer in the past.

887
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,240
A reformer today

888
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,480
might turn to a conservative in the future.

889
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,440
There is no end to the evolution of the world.

890
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,000
So, the struggle between the reformers and the conservatives

891
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,000
has no end as well.

892
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,560
Even in another million years,

893
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,120
things will be the same.

894
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,800
The world will still be the world where

895
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
the reformers and the conservatives are against one another.

896
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,840
Look, today, we are reformers.

897
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,840
Gu Hongming and others are conservative

898
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,360
The environment might change tomorrow.

899
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,360
Maybe it will be reversed.

900
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,280
This is the historical view of evidence.

901
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,880
So you are saying that

902
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,040
maybe one day Gu Hongming's point of view

903
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,400
can also be correct.

904
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,000
First you have to admit

905
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,960
Gu Hongming, Liu Shipei and Huang Kan, 

906
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,360
these are people with specialized knowledge.

907
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,240
Secondly, even now, 

908
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,880
some of their views are still reasonable.

909
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
This fight between them and us,

910
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,800
in the end, it is the need of social change. 

911
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,400
At a certain time,

912
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,400
when living conditions have changed, 

913
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,080
people's understanding of the dispute between the old and the new

914
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
will also change.

915
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,400
It will even reverse.

916
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,360
Do you understand

917
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,040
Yes, I do.

918
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
What's the second issue?

919
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,200
The second one.

920
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
What is us reformers' view on the traditional Chinese education.

921
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,880
What is our attitude?

922
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,640
Remember what I said today.

923
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,200
Because there may be some people in the future

924
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,320
argue over this issue. 

925
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,240
My general opinion is that

926
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,760
the traditional Chinese education

927
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
is a part of world scholarship.

928
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,160
Confucianism,

929
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
it is a part of the traditional Chinese education

930
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,640
The bonds and virtues,

931
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
it is a part of Confucianism,

932
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,680
but only a small part.

933
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,640
As for the existence of fundamental value within Confucianism,

934
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,560
we do not object.

935
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
Wait a minute, too complicated.

936
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
I'm a little confused.

937
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
So what exactly do you object to?

938
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,720
That's a good question.

939
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
Complicated? Then I'll make it easy.

940
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,000
We are opposed to honoring that very little part

941
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,040
of the part of bonds and virtures in Confucianism

942
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,320
as the ultimate guideline for moral standards.

943
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,240
We are also opposed to trashing all that

944
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
tranditional part of Chinese eductaion

945
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
as if they worth nothing at all.

946
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,480
Why the reformers attack the bonds and virtures of Confucianism?

947
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,520
Except for how it is not suitable for the present social life,

948
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,280
what I said also makes one of the reasons.

949
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
I get it now.

950
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
But Mr. Wu Yu and Mr. Yi Baisha,

951
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,360
their aggressive attitudes

952
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
doesn't match what you just said. 

953
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
Didn't I just say that?

954
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,880
There are excesses and overcorrections in the debate. 

955
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,160
This is inevitable.

956
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,160
This letter of mine

957
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
I intend to

958
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
publish it in the next issue of New Youth

959
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,720
If it can't be published, you have to testify for me.

960
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,320
Regarding me, Chen Duxiu, my attitude and stand

961
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,000
in the New Culture Movement.

962
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
I'm afraid I can't do that.

963
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,040
I think,

964
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,800
it doesn't matter what future generations think of us. 

965
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,920
The important thing is 

966
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,240
do we have a clear conscience facing ourselves.

967
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,800
Good point. I agree.

968
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,600
The way you said that is like my father.

969
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,480
Chen Yannian, remember,

970
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,360
about the New Culture Movement,

971
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,440
about the debate between reformers and conservatives,

972
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,320
I'll only tell you this once today, just this once.

973
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
Look, your temper is showing again.

974
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,760
No such thing.

975
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,160
All right, you can leave now.

976
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,760
I've said everything I have to say.

977
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,920
He's having fever?

978
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,360
Sister Qunxian, nature calls.

979
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,600
Wait a minute.

980
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,960
We need to go to the bathroom.

981
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,280
We need to go to the bathroom.

982
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
Hold it!

983
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
We need to go to the bathroom.

984
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,560
Classmates

985
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,440
Girls, come here.

986
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,640
Form a circle.

987
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,720
Boys, stand up and turn around.

988
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,160
Boys, come here.

989
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,680
Su Wu, the diplomatic, kept his faith while being detained by the enemy.

990
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,760
Nothing was there for him except the snow and ice.

991
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,440
Nineteen years of servitude and exile.

992
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,960
Only snow to water his throat and rugs to fill his stomach.

993
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,480
Years after years as a shepherd.

994
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,640
Never for one second he forgot his country and his mission.

995
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,400
The imperial staff that came with him lost all attached fur, yet he was still trapped in the foreign land.

996
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
He went through torture and starvation, death threats and endless coldness.

997
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,520
None of that shook even a little bit of his faith.

998
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,840
Sitting thousands miles away from homeland, he could hear in his mind old songs from his people.

999
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,880
It brought him pain and tears.

1000
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,640
Fellow workers

1001
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
Now the reactionary government 

1002
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,040
has gone after the students.

1003
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,000
They have arrested many students,

1004
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,840
had them all locked up in Peking University.

1005
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,240
The whole country is taking actions.

1006
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,720
Our workmates in Shanghai have taken to the streets.

1007
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,440
We here in Changxindian can't fall behind.

1008
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,440
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind

1009
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,280
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind

1010
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,520
Can't fall behind, can't fall behind

1011
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,480
Can't lag behind

1012
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,000
My fellow friends.

1013
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,720
The workers in Shanghai don't just take to the streets.

1014
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
They have issued a strike declaration.

1015
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,040
On top of that,

1016
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,440
they are planning to start a workers' organization,

1017
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
to lead this social movement

1018
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,520
Friends, think about it.

1019
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,040
The working class steps onto China's political stage.

1020
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,240
This is an epoch-making event.

1021
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Here, I propose that

1022
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
we should also act quickly.

1023
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,400
We should also stand at the forefront of this movement.

1024
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,440
What do you say?

1025
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,160
Yes!

1026
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,280
Mr. Shouchang

1027
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,200
Mr. Shouchang

1028
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,720
Come, Zhong Xie.

1029
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,400
Friends!

1030
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,360
Quiet, everybody, quiet.

1031
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,040
Let's listen to Zhong Xie.

1032
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,520
He has update on the meeting of the students' association.

1033
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,640
Go ahead, please.

1034
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,960
Fellow workers, fellow friends.

1035
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,400
Today is the day the reactionaries took the most strict approach.

1036
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,160
So far,

1037
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,520
We already have about

1038
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,520
more than a thousand students arrested. 

1039
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,600
They are now being held in

1040
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,040
Law and science Department in Peking University

1041
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,200
There is no water, no food.

1042
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,960
No supply at all.

1043
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,320
So the Federation of Students decided

1044
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,440
starting from tomorrow,

1045
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,960
the goal of this movement

1046
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,920
is the all-out rescue for the arrested students. 

1047
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,280
We need to unify the whole country.

1048
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,440
Through all available means,

1049
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,600
force the reactionary government to release people.

1050
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,520
Now the Federation of Students is preparing the declaration.

1051
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,120
Tomorrow morning,

1052
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,120
we will have five thousand students divided in three groups,

1053
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
marching on the streets at the same time.

1054
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,080
These five thousand students will address the same, 

1055
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,400
carrying bags and food.

1056
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,120
They will request to be with their arrested classmates,

1057
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,160
locked up if it's what it takes.

1058
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,360
The rest of the students,

1059
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,560
divided based on Schools,

1060
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,320
will go to the Ministry of Education or the Presidential Palace or Police Department

1061
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,760
for a sit-in demonstration. 

1062
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
Demanding the release the arrested classmates.

1063
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,440
I have four copies of our rules.

1064
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,840
I'll hand it out to you later. 

1065
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,320
Fellow workers and friends,

1066
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,760
just in these two days,

1067
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,880
hundreds of our classmates in Peking University

1068
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,120
were violently arrested.

1069
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,880
Students from No.1 Middle School and No.4 Middle School tomorrow

1070
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,240
will also help us.

1071
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,680
Now we urgently need your help and support.

1072
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
Guys, I suggest

1073
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,440
after this meeting,

1074
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
We form units from each branch factory.

1075
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,240
We go to the streets and we help the students.

1076
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,120
We go to the presidential palace for a petition.
