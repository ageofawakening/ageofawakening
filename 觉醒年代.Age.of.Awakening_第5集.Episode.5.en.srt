lie in education.

If you, Cai Yuanpei,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,840
can use the treasure of Peking University to reform and innovate

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
in order to revive our Chinese nation,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320

The words of Brother Botang

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,560
are exactly what I, Cai Yuanpei, want.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,600
Okay, I'm going to reply to Li Yuanhong

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,080
to take up his post at Peking University as soon as possible.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
Hold on, Brother Jiemin.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,920
and make a career out of it.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,880
It's going to take a lot of work!

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,400
Please teach me, Brother Botang.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
I know you have a well-developed idea

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,760
of how to revolutionize education,

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,720
but in order to achieve your ambition,

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,760
you have to meet the conditions set by Li Yuanhong:

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
sufficient funds,

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
abundance of talented people,

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,720

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,080
Without these three demands,

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
no matter how good your plans are

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
as the old Beijing saying goes

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,760
it will be "a blind waste of time".

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
With Brother Botang's help, I, Yuanpei,

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,880
am certain to become the president of Peking University.

Didn't we agree?

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,560
The first issue will publish Hu Shi's eight vernacular poems.

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
You can't make it a special issue.

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,840
Besides, he's a nobody,

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,200
few people in China know him.

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
If he does not sell, we can not afford the loss.

53
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,280
Put the vernacular poem further back.

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
This article "A Preliminary Discussion of Language Reform" is more influential.

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
Wait, why has it changed to "Reform?"

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
Isn't it a revolution?

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,120
This carries a lot less weight.

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,560
It's understandable that young people have their worries.

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,760
If he wants "Reform" so be it.

61
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll write him an editor's note on this one,

62

77

If the New Culture Movement is not active in Beijing,

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
could it be even called a movement?

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
If no one in Beijing shows up to support "New Youth",

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,840
does it have any influence?

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,200

When I got up in the morning,

115
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
there was no one at home.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was late when no one asked me to go to school.

117
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,640
So I was in a bad mood that day.

118
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
My attitude was naturally bad.

119
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
So I kicked you all out in a rage.

To tell the truth,

197
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,520
I've repeatedly weighted the pros and cons before coming

198

and listened to the views of many people.

199
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,520
The fact I am in Beijing should make my true feelings self-evident. 

200
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,840
I don't need to say too many of these polite words.

201
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
It's that, Jingsheng,

202
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,320
if President Li approves of my prelminary agreement,

Such a big country

229
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040

Why are you in Beijing?

355
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,960
After Shanghai,

356
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640

But now Peking University doesn't accept female students.

360
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
So Bailan worked as a tutor in Dongjiaominxiang

361
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560
tutoring French at the same time,

362
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,640
to work and study in France in the future.

363
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,800
Today, she just got paid.

364
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,320
The two of us planned to come here to have a nice meal.

365

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,120
You are at Peking University now.

368
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,280
I wanted a chance to visit Peking University anyway.

369
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,960
You can show me around when you have time.

370
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,760
Of course, sir.

371
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,560
You don't know it,

372
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,160
but you're a celebrity at Peking Univesity.

373
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
Many students and teachers are all reading

374
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,280
that "New Youth" magazine you founded.

375
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,400
So admirable!

376
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,240
Server!

377
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:10,800
Coming!

378
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
Remove the hotpot separator.

379
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,200
We'll eat from the same pot.

380
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,760
Sure.

381
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
And add another two plates of mutton.

382
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,480
Will do.

383
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,120
Anyone can tell at a glance that you're birds of a feather,

384
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
dipping your food next to each other.

385
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,320
Have a nice meal.

386
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,360
Yes.

387
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,920
Here, eat.

388
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Go ahead, eat.

389
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,080
Thank you, sir.

390
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,640
Eat.

391
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
Zhongfu,

392
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
You've frightened the kids.

393
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,360
Mr. Zhongfu,

394
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,880
have you not eaten for several days?

395
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,920
This is a method I've just learned from the labouring masses.

396
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,000
It's exceptionally delightful.

397
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,440
An absolute delight!

398
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,320
Hurry up and eat. Gotta pick up a fare.

399
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
What fare?

400
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,800
Are you pulling a rickshaw?

401
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
Pulling in investors! Hurry.

402
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,240
Alright!

403
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,400
Brother Jiemin,

404
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,840
from today on, you will be the principal of Peking University.

405
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,480
Master Cai,

406
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,520
this is a heavy responsibility to shoulder.

407
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,120
Please.

408
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,360
Jingsheng, this is hard to come by.

409
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,360
I will cherish it.

410
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,800
I thank everyone for their help.

411
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,720
I, Yuanpei, will certainly fulfill the mission.

412
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,720
Master Cai, when do you plan to assume office?

413
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
And where will you start?

414
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
It is for you to decide when.

415
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,720
And as for where to start,

416
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,560
I think the first step

417
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
is to recruit talent.

418
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,680
First of all, those from the liberal arts.

419
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,520
I would like to find someone

420
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,240
who can raise the banner of innovation to be the dean of liberal arts.

421
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,560
Everyone present, please help me think

422
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
who is able to take on this important task.

423
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
This liberal arts dean

424
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,400
must be sympathetic to you,

425
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,480
but also be of noble character and high prestige.

426
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,320
Must be a learned academic,

427
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,640
but also with the ability to charge through enemy lines.

428
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,560
Such a person is not easy to find.

429
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,480
I've thought of someone.

430
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
Chen Zhongfu, or Chen Duxiu.

431
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,920
This is a person who is leading the trends of today's China.

432
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,880
He is certain to be able to take on this important task.

433
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,960
I also thought of Chen Duxiu.

434
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,800
Are you know Chen Duxiu well?

435
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,320
Only as an acquaintance.

436
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,720
But I've read every issue

437
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,320
of his magazine "New Youth."

438
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,080
Yes, his magazine "New Youth."

439
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,960
I also read it.

440
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Brother Zhongfu and I are old friends.

441
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,240
Qian Xuantong said that

442
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,920
Chen Duxiu has come to Beijing.

443
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,160
He's asked for a meeting to commission an article.

444
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
Where is he living? Do you know?

445
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,160
I will ask around.

446
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,640
Yes. Please.

447
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Zhongfu, listen to me. Zhongfu.

448
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,040
That's one hundred thousand shares acquired in one go.

449
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,480
Zhongfu.

450
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
It's great. Several hundred thousand shares.

451
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,240
We've done it this time.

452
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,560
This time, we can go all out.

453
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,480
It seems like in Beijing our "New Youth"

454
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,360
has a lot of influence.

455
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,920
That's for sure.

456
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,720
Huge potential market.

457
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,760
Definitely.

458
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,480
Now I believe the words you spoke last year.

459
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,680
Which words?

460
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,440
You said, give you ten years.

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And you will change the thinking of our compatriots.

462
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
Now it looks like it won't take ten years.

463
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
We must set up a banquet.

464
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,320
To celebrate.

465
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,800
Yes.

466
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
I will ask Xingang and Bailan to come.

467
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,120
Quickly.

468
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,520
Yes.

469
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,880
Dropped a seed and sprouted a shoot.

470
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,200
What branch, what leaf, what flower will bloom?

471
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,480
Bear what kind of fruit? Grind -

472
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,560
Brother Jiemin.

473
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,800
Brother Zhongfu.

474
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
How did you find me here?

475
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,800
I will always be able to find you.

476
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,800
Come this way, sir.

477
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,400
Please come inside.

478
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,520
In here.

479
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,120
Please sit, sir.

480
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,360
Alright. Please sit.

481
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,640
Have a seat.

482
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,840
Yes.

483
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,880
Sir, sit.

484
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,080
Brother Zhongfu.

485
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,360
I have the impression...

486
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,440
that I am a few years your senior.

487
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,460
I was born in the year of the rabbit，

488
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
in the fifth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu (1879)

489
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,440
We have the same zodiac sign.

490
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,120
I was born in the sixth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi. (1867)

491
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,120
You see, I remembered I am a cycle older than you.

492
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,040
Do you still remember when we were in Shanghai twenty years ago?

493
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,840
Together on an assassination squad,

494
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,680
prototyping a bomb?

495
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,200
How could I forget?

496
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,240
Couldn't manufacture it, narrowly escaped with our lives.

497
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,080
Even now, I often see it in my dreams.

498
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,120
True, true.

499
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,000
At the time, if you hadn't given that shove...

500
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
I would not be sitting in front of you today.

501
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,640
Dead as a doornail, long ago.

502
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Brother Zhongfu,

503
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
you saved my life.

504
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
I have to properly thank you.

505
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,160
You're too kind. You're overstating it.

506
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,960
Twelve years ago,

507
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,360
I was the age you are now.

508
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
At that time,

509
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,840
there was nothing I was afraid of doing, nothing I was afraid of saying. 

510
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,520
I was brave and unyielding.

511
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,360
But now I am old.

512
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,360
No longer have that edge.

513
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,640
And not as driven as times gone by.

514
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,440
You're not doing so bad.

515
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,200
Nowadays, you, Chen Duxiu,

516
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,680
has raised in China the two big banners 

517
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
of science and democracy.

518
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,200
And what have you brought the country?

519
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,360
A breath of fresh air.

520
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,560
I read every issue of your magazine "New Youth."

521
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,480
With each reading, there's always something to be gained.

522
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,560
Sir, if you would like to submit a manuscript,

523
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,400
I would be extremely grateful.

524
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,240
That is a matter of course. Naturally I will contribute.

525
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,400
I came here today

526
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
to ask you for some help.

527
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,640
Please go on, sir.

528
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,600
Starting yesterday, I have been

529
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
formally appointed the president of Peking Univesity.

530
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,480
Take a look. Letter of appointment.

531
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
Congratulations, sir.

532
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,960
I would like you to come to Peking University to be the Dean of Liberal Arts.

533
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,280
Lend me a hand.

534
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
Lend Peking University a hand.

535
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,880
I hope Brother Zhongfu would not decline.

536
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
I would like to thank Brother Jiemin for the support.

537
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,080
But this is very sudden.

538
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm not mentally prepared.

539
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,280
Zhongfu,

540
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,920
the Dean of Liberal Arts is equivalent to the Deputy President of Peking University,

541
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,080
leading the various disciplines of the humanities and social science.

542
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,840
Aren't you currently advocating and calling for

543
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,440
democratic science?

544
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
I think this would be your best stage to do so.

545
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
Precisely because it's a serious responsibility,

546
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,440
I don't want to rashly accept an appointment.

547
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,120
After all, I haven't properly gone to university.

548
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,000
And have no experience teaching or educating others.

549
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,680
An incompetent person who pretends to be competent

550
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
will only hinder the progress of their students.

551
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
If I actually got in the way of your grand undertaking,

552
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
there would be no greater crime.

553
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,240
Don't decline in such a rush.

554
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,360
It's true that this is very abrupt.

555
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,000
You can discuss this at your leisure

556
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
with friends and family and then make a decision.

557
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,720
I am indeed eager in my search for talent.

558
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,040
I am determined to invite you

559
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,520
to Peking University and work together.

560
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,200
For China. For education in China.

561
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,560
For Master Cai to show such high regard for me,

562
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,480
I am truly moved to tears.

563
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,280
If Peking University is to become China's highest educational institution,

564
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,240
it will be the best platform to advocate for science and democracy.

565
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,880
If there is an opportunity to follow Brother Jiemin

566
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
to Peking University and collaborate on this endeavour,

567
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
it would be the blessing of three lifetimes, exactly what I've been looking for.

568
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,160
But to be quite honest,

569
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,960
in my heart,

570
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,280
I can't let go of my "New Youth."

571
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
This magazine is still a fledgling

572
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,040
that has just started picking up.

573
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,400
I came to Beijing this time

574
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,040
precisely because of the magazine. Looking for investors and resources.

575
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,040
A successful harvest.

576
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,880
Only just today, I've discussed

577
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
an investment of over a hundred thousand shares.

578
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,560
At a time like this,

579
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,400
if I leave "New Youth" behind without a care

580
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
to take a position at Peking University,

581
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,520
wouldn't I be letting down

582
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,600
everyone's deep regard?

583
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,800
It's true. I understand.

584
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,960
What you are saying is not without reason.

585
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,680
If the result of you coming to Peking University

586
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,800
is the stoppage of the publication of "New Youth."

587
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,520
That's unacceptable.

588
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,360
Alright. I will now hurry back

589
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,720
to discuss how to solve the problem of "New Youth."

590
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Zhongfu, my thinking is this.

591
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,560
Peking University must exist. "New Youth" must keep running.

592
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,680
I will definitely find a way to satisfy both requirements.

593
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,440
Alright. I'm leaving.

594
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
Brother Jiemin.

595
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,640
Brother Zhongfu.

596
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,960
Let's just call today my first of three humble visits to plead my case.

597
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
Ok. I will get going.

598
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
Brother Mengzou,

599
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,080
I beg of you to handle the matter of signing the contracts.

600
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
I have nothing to say to those business men.

601
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
I would only get in the way.

602
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,320
What? What do you mean?

603
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,080
You're not going?

604
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,200
Zhongfu, everyone is coming to see you.

605
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,720
Signing the contract is such an important thing.

606
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,960
If you don't show up, how will I explain it to them?

607
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Just say I have an important meeting.

608
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,360
And it's the truth.

609
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,760
I need to go to Taoran Pavilion to see Quan Xuantong.

610
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,400
You're a really strange person.

611
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,920
It's snowing so hard.

612
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,040
And it's so cold.

613
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,120
What are you doing meeting someone at Taoran Pavilion?

614
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,720
To sample the northwesterly wind?

615
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,320
You don't understand.

616
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,000
Heavy snow is romantic.

617
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,960
This is the difference between a reader of books and a seller of books.

618
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
To make joy amidst misery is the essence of a scholar.

619
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,920
Not many people these days can keep in tune with such highbrow sentiments.

620
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480
I surmise

621
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,720
Master Qian will not be singing the same tune.

622
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
And I surmise

623
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,720
at this very moment Qian Xuantong is already on his way there.

624
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,600
Zhongfu. Zhongfu.

625
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,280
Don't, Zhongfu.

626
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,920
No, if you leave, what do I do?

627
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Brother Zhongfu!

628
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,440
Deqian, is that you?

629
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,960
I've been looking forward to meeting you. Your reputation preceeds you. 

630
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,240
Today, I finally see your face in person.

631
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,480
Myriad entities have different forms, but they are the same in essence.

632
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,720
Though in the corners of the world, we have never met,

633
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,240
we have long since been alike in spirit.

634
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,120
This is true.

635
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,640
I am a faithful reader of "New Youth"
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian: Peking University professor]

636
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,200
and a die-hard supporter of you, Chen Duxiu.

637
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,440
Deqian, you are too modest.

638
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,160
How is it?

639
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,640
To meet at Taoran pavilion in the snow today.

640
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,840
You don't find it odd?

641
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,040
To see Taoran in the snow?

642
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,240
'Elegant' is the only word for it.

643
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,280
How can it be odd?

644
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,560
You don't find it cold?

645
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,640
To meet brother Zhongfu is to be bathed in spring wind. 

646
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,240
Any chill is entirely absent.

647
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,000
We are indeed fellow travellers.

648
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
We have another fellow traveller.

649
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,400
Let me introduce you.

650
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
This is Liu Bannong.

651
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,960
Literary translator.

652
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,840
and famed writer of the "Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies" school of fiction.

653
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
Bannong,

654
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,840
I've read many of your translations of European fiction.

655
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,580
It has benefited me a great deal.

656
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,040
Compared to you, sir,

657
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,520
I am but a handful of soil next to Mount Tai.

658
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,440
Why are the people in Beijing

659
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,040
all so modest?

660
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,440
Brother Zhongfu, let's talk in the pavilion.

661
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,400
Certainly.

662
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,240
Speaking of Taoran Pavilion,

663
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,380
among the most famous of its associations

664
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,440
is the composition by Jiang Zao, "Taoran Pavilion."

665
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Reportedly, he often invited

666
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,360
scholars and literati, colleagues and close friends

667
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,040
to come here to feast and compose poetry.

668
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,760
Sure enough, it's a peaceful world in the world of mortals.

669
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
It's a pity, wine is left out today!

670
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,800
Brother Zhongfu has come, how can there be no wine?

671
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Someone come! Bring wine!

672
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
Come, come.

673
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,320
This wine is Shaoxing yellow wine. 

674
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,160
That's right. My hometown's Shaoxing yellow wine.

675
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,320
After it's heated up, use a quilt to wrap it. 

676
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,920
It's sent over by a rickshaw.

677
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,000
Deqian, Bannong, you guys really used your heart. 

678
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
I'm moved, I'm moved. 

679
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm waiting for my yellow daisies at home to ripen.

680
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,320
We'll get drunk together and have a good time.

681
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,720
Good! Today there's you, there's snow,

682
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,520
there's Shaoxing yellow wine, there's a qin, there's poetry, there's red plums.

683
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,480
Having intimate friends in high mountains and rivers. It is indeed elegant.

684
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,160
Come.

685
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,120
Let us first toast a cup. 

686
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,440
How is it?

687
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:33,840
Warm!

688
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,200
Come.

689
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,880
Banong, weren't you at Shanghai?

690
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,240
How come you also came to Beijing?

691
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,520
Is it to keep up with the latest fashion?

692
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,840
Peking University is making reforms.

693
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
I was thinking of coming over to apply for a teaching job.

694
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,080
Is this Beijing so attractive

695
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,680
to cultural people?

696
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,440
It's strange to say that

697
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,680
at present, these scholars,

698
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
once arrived, won't leave.

699
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,960
They rush in like ducks,

700
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,080
no matter how poorly they live here.

701
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,280
Why is that?

702
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,120
High culture, low culture.

703
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,680
Dragons and fishes jumbled together, all embracing each other.

704
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,440
The opportunities and risks coexist.

705
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,440
Come.

706
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,880
Brother Zhongfu.

707
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,720
This "New Youth"

708
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,520
is like the fire of today's winter day.

709
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,840
It ignited the light of hope of revitalizing China.

710
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,960
We are all followers of this torch.

711
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,920
This time Duxiu comes to Beijing

712
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
to pay his respects to all of you,

713
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,680
to help "New Youth"

714
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
to make its fire burn brighter.

715
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,280
An unshirkable responsibility.

716
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,200
Come.

717
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,560
Only, Brother Zhongfu, have you thought about

718
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,788
having "New Youth" move to Beijing.

719
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:13,557
Beijing.

720
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:16,071
Can "New Youth" gain a footing in Beijing?

721
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,880
Of course.

722
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,240
More than gain a footing,

723
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,880
to be based in Beijing, we can look at the whole country and develop it.

724
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,920
Come, today we are not going home until we're drunk!

725
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,720
Okay! Cheers. Come. 

726
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,440
Excuse me, may I ask

727
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,880
Is the guest home?

728
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,320
Yes. However, he came home pretty late last night.

729
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,680
It seems like he drank a little too much.

730
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,200
I reckon he's still not up at this time.

731
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,480
Let me call for you

732
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,480
Don't wake him up too loudly.

733
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,840
Let him sleep a while more.

734
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,880
Continue.

735
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,840
Alright. 

736
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,480
Cabinet minister Cai.

737
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,840
I am Cai Yuanpei.

738
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,280
It's really you!

739
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,960
Y-you, what is this you are doing?

740
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
Zhongfu is resting.

741
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,480
I am waiting for him here.

742
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,480
How can this be allowed?

743
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,440
How can we allow you to be so condescending to simple men like this?

744
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,560
I'll call him, I'll call him.

745
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,400
Zhongfu!

746
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:16,960
Don't, don't, don't.

747
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,600
Zhongfu!

748
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,960
Don't, don't wake him up.

749
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,560
Let him sleep a while more.

750
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,520
I can't, I can't.

751
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,800
I see that you look very familiar.

752
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,720
Cabinet minister Cai, your humble servant Wang Mengzou.

753
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,880
Wang Mengzou... I know.

754
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,560
Scholar of Anhui province's Jixi county.

755
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,080
Director of Yadong county's library.

756
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,600
That library of yours is taken care of really well.

757
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,040
You overpraise.

758
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,080
Zhongfu.

759
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,120
Brother Jiemin.

760
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,560
Zhongfu, Zhongfu, the floor below has people.

761
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,080
I apologize, Brother Jiemin.

762
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,280
I drank too much yesterday.

763
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,160
Quick, enter the room.

764
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,560
Come, come, come.

765
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,920
Enter quickly, don't catch a cold.

766
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,200
Forgive me, forgive me.

767
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,520
Don't catch a cold.

768
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,720
Forgive me, sir.

769
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,600
Please sit, sir.

770
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,320
You sit, you sit.

771
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,280
I'll offer tea to you.

772
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,920
You take a seat first.

773
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,800
You guys chat first, I'm going to handle some matters.

774
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,840
Cabinet minister Cai, it was nice to meet you, nice to meet you.

775
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,800
Sir, drink tea.

776
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,480
No need, I'm eating peanuts.

777
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,240
Boldly paid a visit, disturbed your rest. 

778
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,520
Where? 

779
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,520
I just wanted to tell you

780
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,240
Me and Cabinet Minister of Education Fan Yuanlian,

781
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,920
as well as colleagues of Peking University, 

782
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,840
after the negotiations feel 

783
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,600
you are able to have "New Youth"

784
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,640
brought to Peking University to manage. 

785
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,960
At the same time,

786
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,960
"New Youth" can also

787
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,680
implement a lecture on editing for colleagues at Peking University.

788
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,040
If this happens then,

789
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,760
"New Youth" can have Peking University

790
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,400
treated as something to give publicity to Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy,

791
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,160
an exceptionally good platform.

792
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,320
With this, we will promote and spread the New Culture Movement.

793
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,960
I still need to tell you,

794
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,600
the head of humanities course's monthly income is three hundred silver dollars.

795
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
Your whole family can go up north,

796
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,760
settle down in Beijing.

797
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,080
Make up your mind. Come to Peking University.

798
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,520
I sincerely need your help.

799
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,000
Honorable Cai, inviting me so kindly like this,

800
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,560
Duxiu is endlessly grateful.

801
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,560
Speaking truthfully, these two days have been a rush of excitement.

802
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
Cannot sleep soundly at night.

803
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,400
After drinking some wine yesterday night,

804
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,160
only then have I felt I had a good sleep.

805
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,000
It's just that, the matter of "New Youth" entering Beijing,

806
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,520
its implications are profound.

807
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,520
It involves all aspects,

808
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
so I don't dare agree rashly.

809
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,320
How about, 

810
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,120
I recommend you someone to be the dean of liberal arts.

811
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,880
For sure, more outstanding than me.

812
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,800
But this dean of liberal arts,

813
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,000
how can it be possible for another person to take it?

814
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,600
Only you can do it.

815
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,240
Zhongfu, Zhongfu.

816
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,440
Please enter.

817
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,120
Zhongfu.

818
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,600
Yihan.

819
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:36,855
Greetings, sir.

820
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:37,594
Sir.

821
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,600
Bailan, Xingang, you're all here.

822
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,000
Come. Quickly, Come meet Mr. Cai Jiemin.

823
00:39:43,157 --> 00:39:44,565
[Gao Yihan, editor of "The Tiger Daily"]

824
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,440
Honorable Cai, it's an honor to meet you at last.

825
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,920
Greetings, Mr. Jiemin.

826
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,560
Greetings everybody.

827
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,760
What brings you here?

828
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,800
Brother Zhongfu.

829
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
You are able to arrive in Beijing, it's really too good.

830
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,640
Hearing you already arrived in Beijing,

831
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,360
Mr. Zhang Shizhao specially sent me a telegram.

832
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Let me be sure to invite you

833
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,200
to our "The Tiger Daily" editing department,

834
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,080
to take a look,

835
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,200
and give guidance.

836
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,120
If he doesn't invite me, I would go by myself.

837
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,960
"Jiayin" is my old magazine.

838
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,800
How come Shouchang didn't come?

839
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,120
Shouchang isn't here because he's visiting his family.

840
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,160
In a moment, he will

841
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,200
directly hurry to the editing department.

842
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,960
Alright, then why don't go over right now.

843
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,640
Brother Jiemin

844
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,640
Then... You are--

845
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
How about you-- Go over together with us.

846
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,760
It's alright, I'm busy.

847
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,160
I'll come over again next time.

848
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:41,040
Okay, okay, okay.

849
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,600
Mr. Cai, it's really nice to meet you.

850
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,480
You--

851
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,480
Brother Zhongfu.

852
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,680
About the matter of coming to Peking University,

853
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,200
I am still asking you to carefully think it over again.

854
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,440
I have been sincere.

855
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,480
These peanuts are really delicious.

856
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,080
Take care.

857
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,640
Sir. I'll send you.

858
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,520
Take care, sir.

859
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,320
No need to send me out. I can do it.

860
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,920
Mr. Cai, walk well.

861
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,520
Come. Please enter, please enter.

862
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,800
Brother Zhongfu, you're welcome to look around.

863
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,040
"The Tiger Daily" editing department.

864
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,720
This is Mr. Xingyan's great work.
