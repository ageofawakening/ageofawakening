lie in education.

If you, Cai Yuanpei,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,840
can use the treasure of Peking University to reform and innovate

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
in order to revive our Chinese nation,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
you will have our support and hope.

The words of Brother Botang

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,560
are exactly what I, Cai Yuanpei, want.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,600
Okay, I'm going to reply to Li Yuanhong

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,080
to take up his post at Peking University as soon as possible.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
Hold on, Brother Jiemin.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,920
and make a career out of it.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,880
It's going to take a lot of work!

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,400
Please teach me, Brother Botang.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
I know you have a well-developed idea

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,760
of how to revolutionize education,

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,720
but in order to achieve your ambition,

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,760
you have to meet the conditions set by Li Yuanhong:

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
sufficient funds,

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
abundance of talented people,

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,720
transfer of power to lower level.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,080
Without these three demands,

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
no matter how good your plans are

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
as the old Beijing saying goes

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,760
it will be "a blind waste of time".

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
With Brother Botang's help, I, Yuanpei,

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,880
am certain to become the president of Peking University.

Didn't we agree?

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,560
The first issue will publish Hu Shi's eight vernacular poems.

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
You can't make it a special issue.

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,840
Besides, he's a nobody,

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,200
few people in China know him.

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
If he does not sell, we can not afford the loss.

53
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,280
Put the vernacular poem further back.

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
This article "A Preliminary Discussion of Language Reform" is more influential.

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
Wait, why has it changed to "Reform?"

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
Isn't it a revolution?

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,120
This carries a lot less weight.

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,560
It's understandable that young people have their worries.

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,760
If he wants "Reform" so be it.

61
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll write him an editor's note on this one,

62

This "New Youth" is becoming more and more influential

72

and about you, Chen Duxiu,

77
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,320

If the New Culture Movement is not active in Beijing,

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
could it be even called a movement?

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
If no one in Beijing shows up to support "New Youth",

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,840
does it have any influence?

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,200

When I got up in the morning,

115
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
there was no one at home.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was late when no one asked me to go to school.

117
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,640
So I was in a bad mood that day.

118
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
My attitude was naturally bad.

119
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
So I kicked you all out in a rage.

Don't take it personally.

To tell the truth,

197
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,520
I've repeatedly weighted the pros and cons before coming

198

and listened to the views of many people.

199
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,520
The fact I am in Beijing should make my true feelings self-evident. 

200
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,840
I don't need to say too many of these polite words.

201
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
It's that, Jingsheng,

202
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,320
if President Li approves of my prelminary agreement,

203

Brother Jiemin.

208
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,160
Well, this precedent you're setting is a bit too ambitious.

How much does it cost to pay the head fee for a year?

220

It is equivalent to dozens of times the current Peking University.

Such a big country

229
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040

This way!

349
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,840

Why are you in Beijing?

355
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,960
After Shanghai,

356
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640
we both came to Beijing to study.

357

But now Peking University doesn't accept female students.

360
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
So Bailan worked as a tutor in Dongjiaominxiang

361
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560
tutoring French at the same time,

362
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,640
to work and study in France in the future.

363
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,800
Today, she just got paid.

364
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,320
The two of us planned to come here to have a nice meal.

365
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,840
I didn't expect to meet you, sir.

366
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
