238
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,840


239
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320


240
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,000


241
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,520


242
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600


243
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,600


244
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,400


245
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,680


246
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,520


247
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,720


248
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:14,320


249
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,520


250
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,640


251
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,920


252
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,680


253
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,360


254
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,480


255
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720


256
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,360


257
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,640


258
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,040


259
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,240


260
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,360


261
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,520


262
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,240


263
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,320


264
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:36,400


265
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,720


266
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,240


267
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,040


268
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160


269
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,280


270
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,960


271
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560


272
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160


273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440


274
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,520


275
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:55,600


276
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:55,680


277
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,320


278
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,400


279
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,480


280
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,560


281
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,480


282
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,720


283
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160


284
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200


285
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800


286
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240


287
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,640


288
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,360


289
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,320


290
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,680


291
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,240


292
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680


293
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,840


294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920


295
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,280


296
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200


297
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120


298
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,320


299
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,360


300
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,360


301
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,720


302
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,360


303
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,120


304
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,160


305
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,120


306
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160


307
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,840


308
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,080


309
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,240


310
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,600


311
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,240


312
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,840


313
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,480


314
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,400


315
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,600


316
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,320


317
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,600


318
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,840


319
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,400


320
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,440


321
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,480


322
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,760


323
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,960


324
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,080


325
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,640


326
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,840


327
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,240


328
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,520


329
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,320


330
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,680


331
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,960


332
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640


333
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,760


334
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,200


335
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,280


336
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360


337
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560


338
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,640


339
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,800


340
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,320


341
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,840


342
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360


343
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,120


344
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,280


345
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,960


346
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,760
Of course, sir.

347
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,560
You don't know it,

348
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,160
but you're a celebrity at Peking Univesity.

349
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
Many students and teachers are all reading

350
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,280
that "New Youth" magazine you founded.

351
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,400
So admirable!

352
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,240
Server!

353
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:10,800
Coming!

354
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
Remove the hotpot separator.

355
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,200
We'll eat from the same pot.

356
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,760
Sure.

357
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
And add another two plates of mutton.

358
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,480
Will do.

359
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,120
Anyone can tell at a glance that you're birds of a feather,

360
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
dipping your food next to each other.

361
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,320
Have a nice meal.

362
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,360
Yes.

363
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,920
Here, eat.

364
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Go ahead, eat.

365
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,080
Thank you, sir.

366
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,640
Eat.

367
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
Zhongfu,

368
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
You've frightened the kids.

369
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,360
Mr. Zhongfu,

370
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,880
have you not eaten for several days?

371
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,920
This is a method I've just learned from the labouring masses.

372
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,000
It's exceptionally delightful.

373
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,440
An absolute delight!

374
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,320
Hurry up and eat. Gotta pick up a fare.

375
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
What fare?

376
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,800
Are you pulling a rickshaw?

377
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
Pulling in shareholders! Hurry.

378
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,240
Alright!

379
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,400
Brother Jiemin,

380
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,840
from today on, you will be the principal of Peking University.

381
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,480
Master Cai,

382
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,520
this is a heavy responsibility to shoulder.

383
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,120
Please.

384
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,360
Jingshen,

385
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,360
this is hard to come by. I will cherish it.

386
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,800
I thank everyone for their help.

387
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,720
I will certainly fulfil the mission.

388
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,720
Master Cai, when do you plan to assume office?

389
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
And where will you start?

390
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
It is for you to decide when.

391
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,720
And as for where to start,

392
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,560
I think the first step

393
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
is to recruit talent.

394
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,680
First of all, those from the liberal arts.

395
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,520
I would like to find someone

396
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,240
who can raise the banner of innovation to be the dean of liberal arts.

397
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,560
Everyone present, please help me think

398
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
who is able to take on this important task.

399
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
This liberal arts dean

400
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,400
must be sympatico with you,

401
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,480
but also be of noble character and high prestige.

402
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,320
Must be a learned academic,

403
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,640
but also with the ability to charge through enemy lines.

404
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,560
Such a person is not easy to find.

405
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,480
I've thought of someone.

406
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
Chen Zhongfu, or Chen Duxiu.

407
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,920
This is a person who is leading the trends of today's China.

408
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,880
He is certain to be able to take on this important task.

409
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,960
I also thought of Chen Duxiu.

410
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,800
Are you know Chen Duxiu well?

411
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,320
I only know of him.

412
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,720
But I've read every issue

413
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,320
of his magazine "New Youth."

414
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,080
Yes, his magazine "New Youth."

415
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,960
I also read it.

416
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Brother Zhongfu and I are old friends.

417
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,240
Qian Xuantong said that

418
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,920
Chen Duxiu has come to Beijing.

419
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,160
He's asked for a meeting to commission an article.

420
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
Where is he living? Do you know?

421
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,160
I will ask around.

422
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,640
Yes. Please.

423
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Zhongfu, listen to me. Zhongfu.

424
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,040
That's one hundred thousand shares acquired in one go.

425
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,480
Zhongfu.

426
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
It's great. Several hundred thousand shares.

427
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,240
We've done it this time.

428
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,560
This time, we can go all out.

429
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,480
It seems like in Beijing our "New Youth"

430
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,360
has a lot of influence.

431
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,920
That's for sure.

432
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,720
Huge potential market.

433
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,760
Definitely.

434
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,480
Now I believe the words you spoke last year.

435
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,680
Which words?

436
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,440
You said, give you ten years.

437
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And you will change the thinking of our compatriots.

438
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
Now it looks like it won't take ten years.

439
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
We must set up a banquet.

440
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,320
To celebrate.

441
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,800
Yes.

442
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
I will ask Xingang and Bailan to come.

443
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,120
Quickly.

444
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,520
Yes.

445
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,880
Dropped a seed and sprouted a shoot.

446
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,200
What branch, what leaf, what flower will bloom?

447
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,480
Bear what kind of fruit? Grind -

448
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,560
Brother Jiemin.

449
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,800
Brother Zhongfu.

450
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
How did you find me here?

451
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,800
I will always be able to find you.

452
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,800
Come this way, sir.

453
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,400
Please come inside.

454
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,520
In here.

455
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,120
Please sit, sir.

456
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,360
Alright. Please sit.

457
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,640
Have a seat.

458
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,840
Yes.

459
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,880
Sir, sit.

460
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,080
Brother Zhongfu.

461
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,360
I have the impression...

462
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,440
that I am a few years your senior.

463
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,460
I was born in the year of the rabbit，

464
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
in the fifth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu (1879)

465
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,440
We have the same zodiac sign.

466
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,120
I was born in the sixth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi. (1867)

467
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,120
You see, I remembered I am a cycle older than you.

468
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,040
Do you still remember when we were in Shanghai twenty years ago?

469
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,840
Together on an assassination squad,

470
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,680
prototyping a bomb?

471
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,200
How could I forget?

472
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,240
Couldn't manufacture it, narrowly escaped with our lives.

473
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,080
Even now, I often see it in my dreams.

474
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,120
True, true.

475
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,000
At the time, if you hadn't given that shove...

476
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
I would not be sitting in front of you today.

477
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,640
Dead as a doornail, long ago.

478
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Brother Zhongfu,

479
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
you saved my life.

480
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
I have to properly thank you.

481
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,160
You're too kind. You're overstating it.

482
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,960
Twelve years ago,

483
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,360
I was the age you are now.

484
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
At that time,

485
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,840
there was nothing I was afraid of doing, nothing I was afraid of saying. 

486
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,520
I was brave and unyielding.

487
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,360
But now I am old.

488
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,360
No longer have that edge.

489
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,640
And not as driven as times gone by.

490
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,440
You're not doing so bad.

491
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,200
Nowadays, you, Chen Duxiu,

492
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,680
has raised in China the two big banners 

493
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
of science and democracy.

494
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,200
And what have you brought the country?

495
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,360
A breath of fresh air.

496
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,560
I read every issue of your magazine "New Youth."

497
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,480
With each reading, there's always something to be gained.

498
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,560
Sir, if you would like to submit a manuscript,

499
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,400
I would be extremely grateful.

500
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,240
That is a matter of course. Naturally I will contribute.

501
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,400
I came here today

502
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
to ask you for some help.

503
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,640
Please go on, sir.

504
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,600
Starting yesterday, I have been

505
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
formally appointed the president of Peking Univesity.

506
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,480
Take a look. Letter of appointment.

507
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
Congratulations, sir.

508
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,960
I would like you to come to Peking University to be the Dean of Liberal Arts.

509
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,280
Lend me a hand.

510
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
Lend Peking University a hand.

511
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,880
I hope Brother Zhongfu would not decline.

512
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
I would like to thank Brother Jiemin for the support.

513
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,080
But this is very sudden.

514
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm not mentally prepared.

515
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,280
Zhongfu,

516
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,920
the Dean of Liberal Arts is equivalent to the Deputy President of Peking University,

517
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,080
leading the various disciplines of the humanities and social science.

518
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,840
Aren't you currently advocating and calling for

519
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,440
democratic science?

520
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
I think this would be your best stage to do so.

521
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
Precisely because it's a serious responsibility,

522
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,440
I don't want to rashly accept an appointment.

523
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,120
After all, I haven't properly gone to university.

524
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,000
And have no experience teaching or educating others.

525
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,680
An incompetent person who pretends to be competent

526
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
will only hinder the progress of their students.

527
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
If I actually got in the way of your grand undertaking,

528
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
there would be no greater crime.

529
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,240
Don't decline in such a rush.

530
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,360
It's true that this is very abrupt.

531
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,000
You can discuss this at your leisure

532
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
with friends and family and then make a decision.

533
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,720
I am indeed eager in my search for talent.

534
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,040
I am determined to invite you

535
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,520
to Peking University and work together.

536
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,200
For China. For education in China.

537
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,560
For Master Cai to show such high regard for me,

538
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,480
I am truly moved to tears.

539
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,280
If Peking University is to become China's highest educational institution,

540
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,240
it will be the best platform to advocate for science and democracy.

541
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,880
If there is an opportunity to follow Brother Jiemin

542
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
to Peking University and collaborate on this endeavour,

543
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
it would be the blessing of three lifetimes, exactly what I've been looking for.

544
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,160
But to be quite honest,

545
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,960
in my heart,

546
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,280
I can't let go of my "New Youth."

547
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
This magazine is still a fledgling

548
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,040
that has just started picking up.

549
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,400
I came to Beijing this time

550
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,040
precisely because of the magazine. Looking for investors and resources.

551
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,040
A successful harvest.

552
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,880
Only just today, I've discussed

553
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
an investment of over a hundred thousand shares.

554
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,560
At a time like this,

555
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,400
if I leave "New Youth" behind without a care

556
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
to take a position at Peking University,

557
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,520
wouldn't I be letting down

558
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,600
everyone's deep regard?

559
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,800
It's true. I understand.

560
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,960
What you are saying is not without reason.

561
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,680
If the result of you coming to Peking University

562
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,800
is the stoppage of the publication of "New Youth."

563
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,520
That's unacceptable.

564
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,360
Alright. I will now hurry back

565
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,720
to discuss how to solve the problem of "New Youth."

566
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Zhongfu, my thinking is this.

567
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,560
Peking University must exist. "New Youth" must keep running.

568
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,680
I will definitely find a way to satisfy both requirements.

569
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,440
Alright. I'm leaving.

570
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
Brother Jiemin.

571
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,640
Brother Zhongfu.

572
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,960
Let's just call today my first of three humble visits to plead my case.

573
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
Ok. I will get going.

574
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
Brother Mengzou,

575
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,080
I beg of you to handle the matter of signing the contracts.

576
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
I have nothing to say to those business men.

577
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
I would only get in the way.

578
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,320
What? What do you mean?

579
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,080
You're not going?

580
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,200
Zhongfu, everyone is coming to see you.

581
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,720
Signing the contract is such an important thing.

582
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,960
If you don't show up, how will I explain it to them?

583
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Just say I have an important meeting.

584
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,360
And it's the truth.

585
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,760
I need to go to Taoran Pavilion to see Quan Xuantong.

586
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,400
You're a really strange person.

587
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,920
It's snowing so hard.

588
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,040
And it's so cold.

589
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,120
What are you doing meeting someone at Taoran Pavilion?

590
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,720
To sample the northwesterly wind?

591
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,320
You don't understand.

592
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,000
Heavy snow is romantic.

593
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,960
This is the difference between a reader of books and a seller of books.

594
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
To make joy amidst misery is the essence of a scholar.

595
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,920
Not many people these days can keep in tune with such highbrow sentiments.

596
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480
I surmise

597
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,720
Master Qian will not be singing the same tune.

598
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
And I surmise

599
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,720
at this very moment Qian Xuantong is already on his way there.

600
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,600
Zhongfu. Zhongfu.

601
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,280
Don't, Zhongfu.

602
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,920
No, if you leave, what do I do?

603
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Brother Zhongfu!

604
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,440
Deqian, is that you?

605
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,960
I've been looking forward to meeting you. Your reputation preceeds you. 

606
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,240
Today, I finally see your face in person.

607
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,480
Myriad entities have different forms, but they are the same in essence.

608
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,720
Though in the corners of the world, we have never met,

609
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,240
we have long since been alike in spirit.

610
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,120
This is true.

611
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,640
I am a faithful reader of "New Youth"
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian: Peking University professor]

612
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,200
and a die-hard supporter of you, Chen Duxiu.

613
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,440
Deqian, you are too modest.

614
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,160
How is it?

615
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,640
To meet at Taoran pavilion in the snow today.

616
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,840
You don't find it odd?

617
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,040
To see Taoran in the snow?

618
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,240
'Elegant' is the only word for it.

619
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,280
How can it be odd?

620
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,560
You don't find it cold?

621
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,640
To meet brother Zhongfu is to be bathed in spring wind. 

622
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,240
Any chill is entirely absent.

623
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,000
We are indeed fellow travellers.

624
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
We have another fellow traveller.

625
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,400
Let me introduce you.

626
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
This is Liu Bannong.

627
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,960
Literary translator.

628
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,840
and famed writer of the "Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies" school of fiction.

629
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
Bannong,

630
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,840
I've read many of your translations of European fiction.

631
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,580
It has benefited me a great deal.

632
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,040
Compared to you, sir,

633
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,520
I am but a handful of soil next to Mount Tai.

634
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,440
Why are the people in Beijing

635
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,040
all so modest?

636
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,440
Brother Zhongfu, let's talk in the pavilion.

637
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,400
Certainly.

638
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,240
Speaking of Taoran Pavilion,

639
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,380
among the most famous of its associations

640
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,440
is the composition by Jiang Zao, "Taoran Pavilion."

641
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Reportedly, he often invited

642
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,360
scholars and literati, colleagues and close friends

643
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,040
to come here to feast and compose poetry.

644
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,760


645
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
