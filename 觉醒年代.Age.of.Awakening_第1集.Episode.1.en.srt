00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,120
[Episode One]

3
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,160
In 1915,

4
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,520
World War I

5
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,000
entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

6
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:51,080
While Germany was distracted in Europe,

7
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:54,120
Japan stepped up its expansion in China.

8
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:56,520
Before and after,

9
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,600
since the failure of the Second Revolution,

10
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:01,480
Sun Yat-sen and other were forced into exile overseas.

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,520
Bourgeois revolutionaries

12
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,000
were unable to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end.

13
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,440
With political chaos at home,

14
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:13,080
the suffering of the people,

15
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,040
and internal and external troubles,

16
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,760
China was once again thrown into a tumultuous situation.

17
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,400
Mr President,

18
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,880
Japanese Minister Hijiyoshi has sent an ultimatum

19
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:26,040
to be replied within 48 hours.

20
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:29,000
[Yuan Shikai, President of the Republic of China]
What does the ultimatum say?

21
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:30,720
[Liang Shiyi, courtesy name Yifu, Premier of the Republic of China]
If we do not reply within the time limit,

22
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,640
[Liang Shiyi, courtesy name Yifu, Premier of the Republic of China]
nor accept the Twenty-One Demands,

23
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:35,760
[Cao Rulin, courtesy name Yuntian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China]
then Japan will take necessary measures.

24
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:37,680
What does he want?

25
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:38,880
Hijiyoshi said:

26
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:41,640
Japan is to take over Shandong in the northeast

27
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:51,800
Japanese... Over my dead body!

28
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,920
In the afternoon, the Ministry of the Armed Forces reported that

29
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:55,596
the Japanese navy

30
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,640
is appearing to head to our southeast coast.

31
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,840
What?

32
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,000
Does he want a war?

33
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:04,960
Make no mistake:

34
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,840
I am Yuan Shikai,

35
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,160
not Li Hongzhang.

36
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,120
For a long time, there has been discussions in Japan

37
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:12,360
advocating Japanese intervention

38
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:15,200
in our country's Yangtze River Basin activities as soon as possible.

39
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,080
Wimp... Wimp...

40
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,280
You didn't tell Hijikata that

41
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,350
it's not that I, Yuan Shikai, who disagreed with the Twenty-One demands.

42
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:27,680
It's the people who are rebelling so much.

43
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,800
It was them who they hid Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing in Japan.

44
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:33,520
Didn't they also say they should respect public opinion?

45
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,360
The big talk about the unification of the trick worked

46
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:37,840
The Japanese agreed to the demands in Article 5,

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,040
we can discuss it later.

48
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:42,383
But... the treaty must be signed immediately.

49
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,960
What is your Foreign Ministry's response?

50
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,960
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs obeys the orders of the President.

51
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,160
Nicely said.

52
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,800
Then accept the Japanese terms.

53
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:11,800
Now Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and the others will make trouble again.

54
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,080
All these people went out on their knees

55
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,160
It won't be a big deal.

56
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:16,600
Right.

57
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,680
Yuntian, tell the Japanese:

58
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,480
the treaty will be signed,

59
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:25,840
but Article 5 of the demands will not be accepted.

60
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:27,880
This is the bottom line.

61
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
I gave him respect,

62
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:31,960
he should also give me some.

63
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,560
Respectfully yours, Mr President.

64
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,360
What is the deadline for the Japanese?

65
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:37,520
Nine days.

66
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:39,640
Then wait until the night of the ninth day

67
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:41,360
to screw the Japanese.

68
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:43,960
Extra! Extra!

69
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,280
Today's extra is really strange!

70
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,320
President Yuan Shikai

71
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:50,560
is selling out the country!

72
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,760
What a disgrace! Buy! Buy! Buy!

73
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:55,320
His back is not afraid to straighten up,

74
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,600
but the people of the country do not agree!

75
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,600
His anger is nowhere to be seen!

76
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:02,703
Look at this woman! So angry, she steps on the extra!

77
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:06,360
Look at this man! So angry, he breaks his crutch!

78
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,920
7th May, 1915

79
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:13,720
By order of Yuan Shikai,

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,120
an agreement is signed with Japan:

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,560
the Twenty-One Demands which humiliated the country.

82
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:18,880
According to this treaty,

83
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:21,000
China recognized Japan's inheritence of

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,480
all German rights and interests in Shandong.

85
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,200
Japan in southern Manchuria and eastern Mongolia in China

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,680
enjoyed special rights.

87
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:29,520
Japan gets in China

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,800
various railway construction rights, and so on.

89
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,520
The Beiyang government's sell-out

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,280
was strongly opposed by the nation.

91
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:38,440
All major cities in China,

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,960
like Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan,

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,120
Qingdao, and other places

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,880
all held huge demonstrations.

95
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:47,320
Shanghai dockers went on strike

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,640
announcing a boycott of Japanese goods.

97
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,120
Workers in Hankow, Zhenjiang, Hanyang, Changsha,

98
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,480
Fuzhou and other places

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
held various protests one after another.

100
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Refusing to recognise the Twenty-One Demands

101
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,600
and vowing to avenge national humiliation

102
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,400
demonstrates a strong anti-imperialist stance

103
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
and a strong patriotic passion.

104
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:07,754
Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and others in exile overseas

105
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:11,040

114

Big deal.

Let's take it easy, let's eat first.

117

there is no longer any fear to speak out.

Are you still Chinese?

Do you have any patriotism left in you?

China is now in this state,

153
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,240
has been for much more than a day or two ago.

We won't go along with this accusation.

If it weren't for those stupid revolutionaries.

161
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,440
Had they not wanted to copy the American republican system,

162
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:41,080
China would have been a constitutional monarchy.

163
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,560

the grotesque situation we find ourselves in today.

165

Yuan Shikai's attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy

166
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,080
was a real return to the right track.

The idea of a democratic republic

172
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:58,920
is already well established.

Yeah! That's right! Driving backwards!

00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,760
We are the ones driving backwards in history?

Or is it you revolutionaries?
