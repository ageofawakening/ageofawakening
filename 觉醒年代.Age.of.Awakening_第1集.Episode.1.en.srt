00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,120
[Episode One]

3
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,160
In 1915,

4
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,520
World War I

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,760
entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

6
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:51,080
While Germany was distracted in Europe,

7
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:54,120
Japan stepped up its expansion in China.

8
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:56,520
Before and after,

9
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,600
since the failure of the Second Revolution,

10
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:01,480
Sun Yat-sen and others were forced into exile overseas.

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,520
Bourgeois revolutionaries

12
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,000
were unable to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end.

13
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,440
With political chaos at home,

14
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:13,080
the suffering of the people,

15
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,040
and internal and external troubles,

16
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,760
China was once again thrown into a tumultuous situation.

17
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,400
Mr President,

18
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,880
Japanese Minister Hijiyoshi has sent an ultimatum

19
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:26,040
to be replied within 48 hours.

20
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:29,000
[Yuan Shikai, President of the Republic of China]
What does the ultimatum say?

21
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:30,720
[Liang Shiyi, courtesy name Yifu, Premier of the Republic of China]
If we do not reply within the time limit,

22
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,640
[Liang Shiyi, courtesy name Yifu, Premier of the Republic of China]
nor accept the Twenty-One Demands,

23
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:35,760
[Cao Rulin, courtesy name Yuntian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China]
then Japan will take necessary measures.

24
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:37,680
What does he want?

25
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:38,880
Hijiyoshi said:

26
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:41,640
Japan is to take over Shandong in the northeast.

27
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:51,800
Japanese... They still want us dead.

28
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,920
In the afternoon, the Ministry of the Armed Forces reported that

29
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:55,596
there are signs that the Japanese navy

30
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,640
is heading to our southeast coast.

31
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,840
What?

32
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,000
Does he want a war?

33
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:04,960
Make no mistake:

34
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,840
I am Yuan Shikai,

35
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,160
not Li Hongzhang.

36
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,120
For a long time, there has been discussions in Japan

37
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:12,360
advocating for Japanese intervention

38
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:15,200
in our country's Yangtze River Basin activities as soon as possible.

39
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,080
Wimp... Wimp...

40
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,280
You didn't tell Hijikata that

41
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,350
it's not that I, Yuan Shikai, who disagreed with the Twenty-One demands.

42
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:27,680
It's the people who are rebelling so much.

43
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,800
It was them who hid Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing in Japan.

44
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:33,520
Didn't they also say they should respect public opinion?

45
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,360
The big talk about the unification of the trick worked

46
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:37,840
The Japanese agreed to our demands in Article 5,

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,040
we can discuss it later.

48
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:42,383
But... the treaty must be signed immediately.

49
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,960
What is your Foreign Ministry's response?

50
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,960
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs obeys the orders of the President.

51
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,160
Nicely said.

52
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,800
Then accept the Japanese terms.

53
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:11,800
Now Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and the others will make trouble again.

54
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,080
All these people went out on their knees

55
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,160
It won't be a big deal.

56
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:16,600
Right.

57
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,680
Yuntian, tell the Japanese:

58
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,480
the treaty will be signed,

59
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:25,840
but Article 5 of the demands will not be accepted.

60
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:27,880
This is the bottom line.

61
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
I gave him respect,

62
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:31,960
he should also give me some.

63
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,560
Respectfully yours, Mr President.

64
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,360
What is the deadline for the Japanese?

65
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:37,520
Nine days.

66
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:39,640
Then wait until the night of the ninth day

67
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:41,360
to screw the Japanese.

68
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:43,960
Extra! Extra!

69
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,280
Today's extra is really strange!

70
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,320
President Yuan Shikai

71
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:50,560
is selling out the country!

72
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,760
This disgrace! Sells, sells, sells!

73
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:55,320
His back is not afraid to straighten up,

74
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,600
but the people of the country do not agree!

75
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,600
His anger is nowhere to be seen!

76
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:02,703
Look at this woman! So angry, she steps on the extra!

77
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:06,360
Look at this man! So angry, he breaks his crutch!

78
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,920
9th May, 1915

79
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:13,720
By order of Yuan Shikai,

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,120
an agreement is signed with Japan:

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,560
the Twenty-One Demands which humiliated the country.

82
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:18,880
According to this treaty,

83
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:21,000
China recognized Japan's inheritence of

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,480
all German rights and interests in Shandong.

85
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,200
Japan in southern Manchuria and eastern Mongolia in China

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,680
enjoyed special rights.

87
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:29,520
Japan gets in China

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,800
various railway construction rights, and so on.

89
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,520
The Beiyang government's sell-out

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,280
was strongly opposed by the nation.

91
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:38,440
All major cities in China,

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,960
like Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan,

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,120
Qingdao, and other places

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,880
all held huge demonstrations.

95
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:47,320
Shanghai dockers went on strike

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,640
announcing a boycott of Japanese goods.

97
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,120
Workers in Hankow, Zhenjiang, Hanyang, Changsha,

98
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,480
Fuzhou and other places

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
held various protests one after another.

100
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Refusing to recognise the Twenty-One Demands

101
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,600
and vowing to avenge national humiliation

102
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,400
demonstrates a strong anti-imperialist stance

103
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
and a strong patriotic passion.

104
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:07,754
Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and others in exile overseas

105
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:11,040

Let's take it easy, let's eat first.

117
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,120
In a time of national tragedy, there is no time to eat.

there is no longer any fear to speak out.

Are you still Chinese?

150

Do you have any patriotism left in you?

China is now in this state,

153
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,240
has been for much more than a day or two ago.

If it weren't for those stupid revolutionaries.

Had they not wanted to copy the American republican system,

162
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:41,080
China would have been a constitutional monarchy.

163
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,560

165

Yuan Shikai's attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy

166
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,080
was a real return to the right track.

167

172
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:58,920
is already well established.

Aren't you driving backwards in history?

Yeah! That's right! Driving backwards!

175
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,760
We are the ones driving backwards in history?

Or is it you revolutionaries?

00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,000
eighty years of turmoil and bloodshed of millions.

183
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,360
Furthermore, the Chinese people are not yet open-minded.

184
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:26,880
In this case,

185
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:28,760
the forced imposition of a republican system

186
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,400
will be like a floating duck on water, with no roots.

187
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:34,360
Zhang Fengzai, what you just said

188
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,040
is absolutely absurd!

189
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:38,000
The words of Kang Youwei

190
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:40,600
Many revolutionary martyrs have already refuted the fact that

191
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:42,520
the revolution would shed blood.

192
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,400
But I would like to ask you:

193
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:48,040
if the monarch comes first, will there be no bloodshed?

194
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:48,800
Right!

195
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,442
[Zhang Tuzhao, courtesy name Xing Yan, prominent social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

196
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,000
[Zhang Tuzhao, courtesy name Xing Yan, prominent social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Yeah! That's right!

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,520
[Zhang Tuzhao, courtesy name Xing Yan, prominent social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy.

198
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:55,440
Which country has not experienced this?

199
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,760
How many times has this changed?

200
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,360
The sacrifices that have been made

201
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:01,400
to achieve real social progress.

202
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:03,200
Another thing I want to ask you is,

203
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:05,000
what did you just say?

204
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:09,040
Our country is not yet open-minded?

205
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,040
That's demonstrably false!

206
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,160
Since the Xinhai Revolution,

207
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,960
the mindset of the entire population

208
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:18,154
has changed dramatically.

209
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:21,120
Judging from the unanimous rejection of Yuan at home and abroad,

210
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,640
this is hard evidence.

211
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,960
The more the nation is at stake,

212
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:28,000
the more the people should become aware of the situation.

213
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:29,880
To revive the national spirit

214
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,480
and if the idea of republicanism is to be put into practice

215
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:33,560
for the people,

216
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:36,600
it is necessary to overthrow the feudal ideology

217
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:39,880
Zhang Fengzai, those who go against the tide of history

218
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,720
will be drowned by the torrent of the times.

219
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,280
For the love of our country,

220
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,200
we want to save our country. Down with Yuan.

221
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:50,000
For the sake of our Chinese nation,

222
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:53,455
we must save our country. Down with Yuan!

223
00:11:53,821 --> 00:12:01,920
Save the country! Down with Yuan!

224
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:02,880
Well said!

225
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:04,720
Well said!

226
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
Professor Xing Yan.

227
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:09,360
Hello students.

228
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:10,920
The usual words:

229
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,800
well-reasoned, from the heart,

230
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:16,760
passionate, engaging.

231
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,960
Very good.

232
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:21,040
Zhongfu, what do you think?

233
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:23,040
Zhongfu? Chen Duxiu?

234
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:25,200
It's Chen Duxiu!

235
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,400
Chen Duxiu!

236
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,720
Is it Chen Duxiu?

237
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,200
Why does he look like that?

238
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,400
[Chen Duxiu, courtesy name Zhongfu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

239
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,720
[Chen Duxiu, courtesy name Zhongfu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Could it be Chen Duxiu?

240
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,200
[Chen Duxiu, courtesy name Zhongfu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
It can't be.

241
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:37,000
[Chen Duxiu, courtesy name Zhongfu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
If you say so.

242
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:39,080
A young man of great insight:

243
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,120
Chen Duxiu.

244
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:42,840
Why are you eating here?

245
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,920
I was just passing by

246
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:45,600
seeing them bickering.

247
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:46,520
No one was eating.

248
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,080
One should never waste food at any time.

249
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,720
It's shameful to waste food

250
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:54,120
What time is it? You're still eating here?

251
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,040
Are you Chen Duxiu?

252
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:01,600
I am, yes.

253
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:02,320
He really is!

254
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,400
You are Chen Duxiu.

255
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:06,320
He is! He's Chen Duxiu!

256
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:07,480
Quiet, everyone!

257
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:09,240
Quiet!

258
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:11,920
Since Mr. Zhongfu is here,

259
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:13,400
we would like to ask you:

260
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,280
what do you think should be done to save China?

261
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:17,800
I think that

262
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,880
such a country is irredeemable.

263
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,880
What did you say?

264
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,400
Are you Chinese? How can you say that?

265
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:27,960
Chen Duxiu, are you talking about human beings?

266
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:29,600
Simply shameless!

267
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:31,560
Shameless!

268
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:32,840
What are you doing?

269
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,560
You've gone too far!

270
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:37,800
Mr. Zhongfu, what you just said,

271
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,560
do you really believe that?

272
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,320
Yes, of course.

273
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,080
But yeah, I meant to say...

274
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
You see?!

275
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,880
Students! You have seen it!

276
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,080
This is what you call a revolutionary party!

277
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:50,880
Behold, the great revolutionary!

278
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:52,720
Do you know what he said?

279
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:55,120
He said he was sorry for his country's subjugation.

280
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,120
What else?

281
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:59,360
What is the horror of being a slave to a fallen nation?

282
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,864
A country of a brutalized people, where is the love for it?

283
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,760
This is the real traitor, the traitor to the nation!

284
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,120
Sell-out! Traitor!

285
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
Traitor!

286
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,440
Get out of the way!

287
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,200
Don't do it!

288
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:16,560
Let's have a good chat!

289
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:17,440
Don't do it!

290
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,160
Stop!

291
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Don't do it!

292
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,720
Don't do it!

293
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,000
Mr Zhongfu, go!

294
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't do it!

295
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:27,400
Let's have a good chat! Don't do it!

296
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:29,360
Come on, this way!

297
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,400
Don't do it, people, don't do it!

298
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,280
Listen to me for a moment!

299
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,240
Mr. Xing Yan has a message for everyone!

300
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,720
Mr. Xing Yan has a message for everyone!

301
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,200
Come on, everyone, let me tell you something!

302
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
Come on, come on!

303
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,120
Alright.

304
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,120
Alright, alright, no one is following.

305
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:56,640
Take a break, take a break.

306
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:21,120
Not like Chen Duxiu, right?

307
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,520
I just imagined

308
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,760
something a little different.

309
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:29,120
So what do you imagine it should be like?

310
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:30,800
Are you okay?

311
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:34,560
I apologise for the situation.

312
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,981
It's okay, I've seen a lot of these.

313
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:41,702
Your article

314
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:44,520
"Patriotism and Self-consciousness", I've read it.

315
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:47,040
But there are many doubts and unanswered questions.

316
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:49,120
I would like to ask you some, is that okay?

317
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,960
I know that you, Li Dazhao, are from Hebei.

318
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:55,345
Yanzhao is a land of compassion and tragedy, I must confess. (?)

319
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,800
But now in China

320
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,640
there is a shortage of real men who believe in the truth.

321
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,960
Ask.

322
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,840
You said that patriotism should have a stand

323
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,560
and not be willing to be Yuan Shikai's obedient people

324
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,400
in the name of patriotism,

325
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,080
according to you,

326
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:10,760
as long as Yuan Shikai is in power.

327
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,040
People should not be patriotic.

328
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,160
You misunderstood the reasoning behind it.

329
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,000
I meant to say:

330
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,200
patriotism should have a position.

331
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,240
You can't link patriotism with loyalty to Yuan Shikai.

332
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:24,320
You can't confuse

333
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,840
patriotism with loyalty to Yuan Shikai

334
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,640
to cover up Yuan Shikai's theft of the country.

335
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,280
This is similar to what you just said,

336
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,440
doesn't it match?

337
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:32,880
That Yuan Shikai

338
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:35,720
claims that he represents the country.

339
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,840
He is confusing the emotion.

340
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,000
If patriotism has no position,

341
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,240
then we simply have no reason

342
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,000
to defeat Yuan Shikai.

343
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:46,480
I agree.

344
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:48,480
I think the first priority today is

345
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:51,160
to inspire the people to be truly patriotic.

346
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:54,320
Right now China is being divided up by the Western powers.

347
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:55,840
If we are not patriotic,

348
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
then the country will die.

349
00:16:57,915 --> 00:16:59,960
Shou Chang, I ask you:

350
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,229
What did the Western powers rely on to carve up China?

351
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:04,320
Gunboats.

352
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:04,960
No.

353
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:07,454
You are talking about the Opium War and the Sino-Japanese War.

354
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:11,235
Now the powers are dividing China by borrowing money.

355
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:13,170
The Chinese government

356
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:16,550
borrows foreign debt from Western countries every year.

357
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,808
More than half of the treasury's revenue,

358
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,087
in a country without productivity.

359
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,510
The state can only be maintained

360
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,390
by borrowing against the national tax railroad.

361
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:29,782
What do you expect from a country like this?

362
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:32,270
That's why we're going to overthrow Yuan,

363
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,192
overthrow this corrupt government,

364
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:35,544
and build a new nation.

365
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:36,080
No!

366
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,027
China can be saved by political revolution.

367
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,920
China's problems are accumulating.

368
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:44,469
Can we solve the problem by changing people and governments?

369
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:47,509
So, according to you,

370
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,262
China has no way out?

371
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,184
Yes, but the way out is not the old way.

372
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,032
The way out is a new way.

373
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:56,845
China will not die.

374
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:57,950
What is the old way?

375
00:17:58,425 --> 00:17:59,383
The dynastic cycle:

376
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:00,640
the overthrow of an old dynasty,

377
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,643
the establishment of a new dynasty.

378
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,246
The cycle repeats itself. It's the old way.

379
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,388
And what is the new way?

380
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,193
Don't know.

381
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,382
That's what I'm looking for.

382
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,262
Shou Chang, I appreciate your knowledge and talent.

383
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,317
Will you look for it with me?

384
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,520
To find a way to save China

385
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:24,062
is my life's work.

386
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:25,719
I will.

387
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:27,716
Good.

388
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,474
Zhongfu!

389
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,915
You both came here!

390
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:39,707
Let's make it easy to find.

391
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:41,746
Tickets... we have the tickets.

392
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:43,889
Tomorrow we can go back home.

393
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:47,631
Excellent. Finally we can go back.

394
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:50,481
Zhongfu, before I go back,

395
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,189
I finally got to see Shou Chang.

396
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,913
It's not in vain that you have been charged 

397
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,626
with being a traitor to your country.

398
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,187
Not in vain... not in vain...

399
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,199
See me.

400
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:01,902
Yeah.

401
00:19:02,469 --> 00:19:04,266
He's here to see you today.

402
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:06,601
Ever since he was on the "Kaiyin",

403
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,170
and read your article,

404
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,229
he's been wanting to see you.

405
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:11,305
It was worth the trip.

406
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:14,399
A great harvest, a great treasure.

407
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:18,582
You... You are always bored in the room writing articles

408
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:19,555
not letting us control

409
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:20,425
nor letting us ask,

410
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,186
making yourself like a beggar.

411
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:23,039
I've got lice all over my body.

Don't scare Junman when you return home

00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:26,621
[Yi Baisha, courtesy name Yue Chuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Hurry back

Cut your hair, take a bath and change your clothes

419
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:28,548
Cut your hair, take a bath and change your clothes

420
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:29,843
You can take a bath

421
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,710
There's only one dress that hasn't been changed

422
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:32,654
Alright

423
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,539
Zhongfu, wait!

424
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,107
It's windy at sea. Take care of yourself.

425
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,334
Okay, then I'll be happy to do so.

426
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:53,832
Shou Chang, I owe you three favours today.

427
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,339
In the future, you must remember to ask for it

428
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,320
What are they?

429
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:59,135
One is to help me get out of trouble.

430
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,591
Second is to lend me clothes

431
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:01,896
And the third?

432
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:03,495
I ate your food.

433
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:07,980
But I had enough to eat before

434
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,175
they knocked me off my feet.

435
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:10,820
Then keep rubbing it in

436
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,370
Can I buy you all dinner?

437
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,415
We haven't even eaten yet

438
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:14,904
Then we'll follow the rub

439
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:16,334
Good! Zhongfu, this way!
