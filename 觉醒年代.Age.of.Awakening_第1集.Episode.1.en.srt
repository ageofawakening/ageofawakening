00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,120
[Episode One]

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,880
In 1915,

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,360
World War I

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,600
entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,920
While Germany was distracted in the European theater,

7
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,960
Japan stepped up its expansion in China.

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
During this time period,

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,440
since the Second Revolution's failure,
(The Second Revolution refers to a 1913 revolt by the governors of several southern Chinese provinces as well as supporters of Sun Yat Sen and the Kuomintang against the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China led by Yuan Shikai.)

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,240
Sun Yat-sen and others were forced into exile overseas.

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,280
Bourgeois revolutionaries

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,880
were unable to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
Domestic political chaos,

14
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,920
the unbearable suffering of the people,

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,920
internal trouble and external aggression

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,640
had once again thrown China into a tumult.

17
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,280
Mr. President,

18
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Japanese diplomat Hioki Eki has sent an ultimatum

19
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,960
to be answered within forty-eight hours.

20
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,920
[Yuan Shikai, President of the Republic of China]
What does the ultimatum say?

21
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,520
If the Twenty-One Demands
[Liang Shiyi, styled Yifu, Secretary General of the Presidential Office of the Republic of China]

22
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,480
are not accepted within the time frame,

23
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,560
then Japan will take necessary measures.
[Cao Rulin, styled Runtian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China]

24
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,560
What does he want?

25
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
Hioki Eki said

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,480
Japan is to take over Shandong as they took over the northeast.

27
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,640
The Japanese... They still want us dead.

28
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,800
This afternoon, the Ministry of War reported

29
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
that Japanese naval formations

30
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,520
are heading for our southeast coast.

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,640
What?

32
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,840
Does he still want another Jiawu War (First Sino-Japanese War)?

33
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,840
Make no mistake.

34
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,760
I am Yuan Shikai,

35
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
not Li Hongzhang (politician, general and diplomat of the late Qing dynasty, who directed Chinese forced during the First Sino-Japanese War).

36
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
For a long time, there have been discussions in Japan

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,280
advocating for Japanese intervention

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,080
in our country's Yangtze River basin as soon as possible.

39
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,960
Useless... Useless...

40
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,120
Didn't you tell Hioki Eki that

41
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,240
it's not that I, Yuan Shikai, who disagreed with the Twenty-One Demands?

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
It's the people who are rebelling so much.

43
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,680
When they (the Japanese) hid Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing in Japan,

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,400
didn't they say we should respect public opinion?

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
Mr. President, our appeal has worked.

46
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,720
The Japanese agree that the articles in Section 5 (which will give Japan decisive voice in China's financing, policing and governmental affairs)

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,920
can be discussed later.

48
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,360
But... the treaty must be signed immediately.

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,880
What's the response of Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

50
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,880
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs obeys the orders of the President.

51
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,080
How cunning!

52
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
Then just accept the terms of the Japanese.

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,640
Now Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and the others will make trouble again.

54
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,880
All these people have gone overseas.

55
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,000
It won't be a big deal.

56
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:16,600
Right.

57
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Runtian, tell the Japanese

58
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
the treaty will be signed,

59
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,640
but the articles in Section 5 cannot be accepted.

60
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,800
This is the bottom line.

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
I gave him face,

62
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
he should also give me some.

63
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,400
Understood, Mr. President.

64
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Which day is the deadline proposed by the Japanese?

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,320
The ninth.

66
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,480
Then wait until the evening of the ninth

67
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,240
to inform the Japanese.

68
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,880
Extra! Extra!

69
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,120
Today's extra is very strange!

70
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
President Yuan Shikai

71
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,440
is selling out the country!

72
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,680
The wastrel, sells, sells, sells!

73
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,160
His backbone simply has no strength.

74
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,480
But the common masses won't say yes,

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,480
they were seized with fury and wrath.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,600
Look at this woman! So angry, she stomps on the extra!

77
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,200
Look at this man! So angry, he breaks his crutch!

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,800
On May 9th, 1915,

79
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,640
Yuan Shikai ordered the

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,920
signing with Japan a treaty of national betrayal and humiliation --

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
the Twenty-One Demands.

82
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
According to this treaty,

83
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,840
China will recognize Japan's inheritance of

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,240
all German rights and interests in Shandong.

85
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,120
Japan will enjoy special privileges

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,560
in southern Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia.

87
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,400
Japan will acquire, in China,

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,720
various railway construction rights, and so on.

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,360
The Beiyang government's treasonous acts

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,160
were strongly opposed by the nation.

91
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,360
All major cities in China,

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,840
such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan,

93
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,960
Qingdao, and etc.,

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,680
had held large-scale demonstrations.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,080
Shanghai dockers went on strike

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,520
announcing a boycott of Japanese goods.

97
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,880
Workers in Hankow, Zhenjiang, Hanyang, Changsha,

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,400
Fuzhou and other places

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,800
held various protests one after another,

100
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,120
refusing to recognize the Twenty-One Demands

101
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,400
and vowing to avenge national humiliation,

102
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,280
which demonstrated a firm anti-imperialist stance

103
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,440
and a strong patriotic passion.

104
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,640
Exiles like Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and their followers

105
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,920
call for revolutionaries to return to China to oppose Yuan.

only to gain this type of result.
[Gao Yihan, Student at Waseda University]

Do we really have no way out?

This kind of big event

114
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,320
is not something you and I can control.

115

Let's take it easy, and eat first.

116
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
Faced with such national crisis, nobody is in the mood to eat.

117
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,520
We all vowed to share weal and woe with our country,

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,680
how... how can you still eat?

119
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,960
You can't do anything without eating!

Heaven kills, the war clouds fly.

122

The Wa peoplen (i.e., the Japanese) seize their chance, and pressing upon our Xiayu (i.e.,Chinese territory).

looking back at Shenzhou (i.e., China), and looking up to heaven, sorrowful and enraged!

125

Now that our country has fallen and our people have died,

126
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,000
there is no need to hold back from taking actions against the evildoer for fear of involving good people.

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,360
We should have the determination to press ahead.

128

The arch-usurper Yuan Shikai

129
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,400
wants to restore the imperial system and become the emperor.

130
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,920

Return home!

140
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,640
Overthrow Yuan!

141
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Okay, stop yelling.

142
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,080
How do you guys have the power to overthrow Yuan?

143
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,840
Just don't make trouble for the country.

144
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,600
What did you say?

145
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,760
Zhang Fengzai,

146
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,640
now that our country is in crisis and the Republic is perishing,

147
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,640
yet you guys are behaving rather peculiar here.

148
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,720
Can you still regard yourselves as Chinese?

149
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,720
Do you have any patriotism left in you?

150
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,640
That's right! Are you Chinese?!

151
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,600
China has been in this state

152
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,120
for much more than a day or two.

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
Can you save the country like this?

154
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,280
It's all because of you apathetic people,

155
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,760
China has now fallen into such an abyss.

156
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,240
Yeah! It is because of you!

157
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,520
Because of us?

158
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,120
We won't go along with this accusation.

159
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,320
If it weren't for those stupid revolutionaries.

160
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,360
Had they not tried to copy the American republican system,

161
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,000
China would have been a constitutional monarchy.

162
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,440
It wouldn't have turned out to be

163
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,120
the grotesque situation we find ourselves in today.

164
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,760
Yuan Shikai's attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy

165
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,920
was essentially a return to the correct path.

166
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,400
This is the way to save China,

167
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,680
and the foundation of prosperity.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,800
Nonsense!

169
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,800
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!

170
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,160
The idea of a democratic republic

171
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,760
is already well established.

172
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,440
Aren't you driving backwards in history?

173
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,640
Yeah! That's right! Driving backwards!

174
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,520
We are the ones driving backwards in history?

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,520
Or is it you revolutionaries,

176
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,680
who ignored China's national conditions?

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,080
Students! Countrymen!

178
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,400
Kang Youwei has long said

179
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,640
a revolution is not a good thing for a country.

180
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,320
The French Revolution,

181
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,880
eighty years of turmoil and bloodshed of millions.

182
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,240
Furthermore, the Chinese people are not yet enlightened.

183
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
In this case,

184
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,600
the forced imposition of a republican system

185
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,240
will be like duckweed floating on water, with no roots!

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Zhang Fengzai, what you just said

187
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,040
is absolutely absurd!

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Kang Youwei's words

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
have been refuted by many revolutionary martyrs.

190
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
The revolution will certainly shed blood.

191
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
But I would like to ask you,

192
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,880
will the constitutional monarchy not shed any blood?

193
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,840
Right!

194
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,840
Yeah! Good point!

Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy,
[Zhang Shizhao, styled Xingyan, famous social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

196
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,240
which one of these countries has not experienced

197
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,600
many changes

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
and made great sacrifices,

199
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,320
before it has achieved real social progress?

200
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,080
Another thing I want to ask you is,

201
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,920
what did you mean when you just said

202
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,840
our people are not yet enlightened?

203
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,840
That's demonstrably false!

204
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Since the Xinhai Revolution,

205
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
the entire population's thinking

206
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,040
has already undergone earth-shaking changes.

207
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,000
The unanimous rejection of Yuan at home and abroad

208
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,520
is the solid evidence of that!

209
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,840
The more the nation is in peril,

210
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,880
the more it should awaken people's consciousness

211
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,720
and invigorate the national spirit.

212
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,360
And if the idea of republicanism

213
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,480
is to be instilled in the people,

214
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,440
it is necessary to overthrow the feudal ideology.

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Zhang Fengzai, those who go against the tide of history

216
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,600
will be drowned by the torrent of the times.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,120
For the love of country,

218
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,000
we must save our country and overthrow Yuan.

219
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
For our Chinese nation,

220
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,320
we must save our country and overthrow Yuan!

221
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:01,880
Save the country! Overthrow Yuan!

222
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,748
Well said!

223
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:04,720
Well said!

224
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,000
Mr. Xingyan. Mr. Xingyan.

225
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,240
Hello students.

226
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
Shouchang's words

227
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,640
not only were on just grounds, but also came from the bottom of his heart,

228
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,600
impassioned, engaging and on point.

229
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,800
Excellent!

230
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,920
Zhongfu, what do you think?

231
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,920
Zhongfu? Chen Duxiu?

232
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,000
This is Chen Duxiu?

233
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,384
Chen Duxiu!

234
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,720
Is this Chen Duxiu?

235
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
Why does he look like that?

236
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,520
Could it be Chen Duxiu?

It can't be.
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, famous revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

238
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,840
As you said,
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, famous revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

239
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
he is a very intelligent young man.

240
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,960
Chen Duxiu.

241
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,600
Why are you eating here?

242
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,800
I was just passing by

243
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,480
seeing them bickering.

244
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,440
No one was eating.

245
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,920
Food should not be wasted at any time.

246
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,520
It's shameful to waste food.

247
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,880
What time is it? You're still eating here?

248
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,840
Are you Chen Duxiu?

249
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,320
I am, yes.

250
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,200
He really is!

251
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,160
I am Chen Duxiu.

252
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,200
He is! He's Chen Duxiu!

253
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,320
Quiet, everyone!

254
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,080
Quiet!

255
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,800
Since Mr. Zhongfu is here,

256
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,240
we would like to ask you,

257
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,120
what should be done to save China in your opinion?

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,640
I think that

259
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
such a country is beyond saving.

260
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,680
What did you say?

261
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,240
Are you a Chinese? How dare you say that?

262
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,800
Chen Duxiu. Are you talking in human language?

263
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Simply shameless!

264
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,400
Shameless!

265
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,680
What are you doing?

266
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,400
You've gone too far!

267
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,720
Mr. Zhongfu, is what you just said

268
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
really what you think?

269
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,080
Yes, of course.

270
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,920
But, what I meant to say...

271
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
You see?!

272
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,880
Students! You have seen it!

273
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,920
This is your so called revolutionary!

274
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,760
A great revolutionary!

275
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,600
Do you know what he once said?

276
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,920
He said he didn't care for his country's subjugation!

277
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,960
What else?

278
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,160
What's terrible of being a slave to a subjugated country?

279
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,840
What's lovable about a country of brutalized people?

280
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,640
This is the real traitor! A big collaborator!

281
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
Traitor! Collaborator!

282
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
Collaborator!

283
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,280
Get out of the way!

284
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,040
Don't strike

285
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
Let's just talk!

286
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,240
Don't do it!

287
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,000
Stop!

288
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,868
Don't strike

289
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,630
Don't do it!

290
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,840
Mr. Zhongfu, go!

291
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,440
Don't do it!

292
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,240
Let's just talk! Don't strike!

293
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,160
Come on, this way!

294
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,240
Don't do it, people, calm down!

295
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,120
Listen to me for a moment!

296
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,225
Mr. Xingyan has a message for everyone!

297
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,720
Mr. Xingyan has a message for everyone!

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,120
Come on, everyone, allow me to say something here.

299
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Come on, come on!

300
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,920
Alright.

301
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,920
Alright, alright, no one is following.

302
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,520
Take a break, take a breather.

303
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm nothing like Chen Duxiu, right?

304
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,320
Just a little different from

305
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,520
my imagination.

306
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
So what do you imagine I should be?

307
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,680
Are you okay?

308
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,440
I apologize for the situation.

309
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,880
It's okay, I've seen a lot of these.

310
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,560
Your article

311
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,360
"Self Consciousness on Patriotism", I've read it.

312
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,840
But I have many doubts and questions.

313
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
I would like to seek you explanation, is that okay?

314
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,800
I know that you, Li Dazhao, are from Hebei.

315
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,320
Yanzhao (Hebei in Warring State period) is known for its fervent and sorrowful people, they insist relentlessly.

316
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,600
But China nowadays

317
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,520
is in need of real heroes who insist relentlessly.

318
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,880
Please ask your questions.

319
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,680
You said that patriotism should have a position,

320
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,440
and that we should not, under the pretext of patriotism,

321
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,280
be one of Yuan Shikai's obedient subjects.

322
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,920
Then according to you,

323
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,600
as long as Yuan Shikai is in power,

324
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,880
people should not be patriotic.

325
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,960
You stubborn man, you misunderstood.

326
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,800
I meant to say,

327
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,040
patriotism should have a position,

328
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,080
and patriotism should not be confused

329
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,200
with loyalty to Yuan Shikai,

330
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,640
or covering up Yuan Shikai's usurp of state power,

331
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,520
under the pretext of patriotism.

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,120
This is similar to what the statements you made earlier,

333
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
is it not?

334
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,760
That Yuan Shikai

335
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,640
keeps saying that he represents the country.

336
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
He is deliberately confusing different concepts.

337
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,840
If patriotism has no position,

338
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,160
then we simply have no reason

339
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,280
to overthrow Yuan Shikai.

340
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,280
I completely agree.

341
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,360
I think the top priority today is

342
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,000
to inspire the people to be truly patriotic.

343
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,040
Right now, China is being divided up by the Western powers.

344
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
If everyone is not patriotic,

345
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,240
then the country will definitely perish.

346
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,800
Shouchang, let me I ask you,

347
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,160
what are the Western powers relying on to carve up China?

348
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,120
Their powerful navies and strong weaponry.

349
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,840
No!

350
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,400
You are talking about the Opium War and naval failure of the Jiawu War.

351
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,160
Now the foreign powers are dividing China by giving loans.

352
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,080
The Chinese government

353
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,440
borrows foreign debt from Western countries every year,

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,760
accounting for more than half of the treasury's revenue.

355
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
In a country without productivity,

356
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,400
it relies exclusively on putting up its national tax and railways as collaterals,

357
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,320
and taking loans to maintain its political power.

358
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,640
What do you expect from a country like this?

359
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,120
That's exactly why we're going to overthrow Yuan,

360
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,040
overthrow this corrupt government,

361
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,400
and build a new nation.

362
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,040
No!

363
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,880
Can China be saved by political revolution?

364
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,800
China's problems are ingrained habits that are hard to break.

365
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,440
Can we solve the problems simply by changing the leaders or governments?

366
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,400
So according to you,

367
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
our China has no way out?

368
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,040
There is a way, but the way out is not the old way.

369
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,920
Only when we find a new way out,

370
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
China will not perish.

371
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,880
What is the old way?

372
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,240
The succession of political regimes,

373
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,600
the replacing of an old dynasty

374
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
with a new dynasty.

375
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,160
The cycle repeats itself.This is the old way.

376
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,200
And what is the new way?

377
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,080
I don't know yet.

378
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,280
That's what I'm looking for.

379
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,200
Shouchang, I appreciate your insights and your talent.

380
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,280
Will you look for this new path with me?

381
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,480
To find a way to save China

382
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
is my life's work.

383
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,560
I will.

384
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,640
Good.

385
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,320
Zhongfu!

386
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
You've both come here

387
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,560
and made us look for you!

388
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,640
Tickets... we have the tickets.

389
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,800
Tomorrow we can go back home.

390
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,480
Excellent. Finally we can go back.

391
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,440
Zhongfu, before you head back,

392
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,120
you finally got to see Shouchang.

393
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
It's not in vain that you took

394
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,520
the crime of being a traitor.

395
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,108
Not in vain... not in vain...

396
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,040
See me?

397
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,800
Yeah.

398
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,200
He's here to see you today.

399
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,440
Ever since he read from the "The Tiger",

400
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,120
your article,

401
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,120
he's been wanting to see you.

402
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,160
Was it worth the trip?

403
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,280
The harvest is rich, like a heaven-sent gift!

404
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,520
You... you always stay indoors to write articles

405
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,400
not allowing us to care for you,

406
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,360
or ask questions,

407
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,040
making yourself like a beggar.

408
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,960
With you unkempt hair, dirty face, and body-full of lice,

You'll definitely scare Junman when you get back home!

410
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,600
Hurry back!
[Yi Baisha, styled Yuecun, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

411
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,440
Cut your hair, take a bath, and change your clothes.

412
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,800
I can take a bath,

413
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,560
but I only have one set of clothes. There's nothing else to change into.

414
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,520
Alright.

415
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,440
Brother Zhongfu. Wait.

416
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,000
It's going to be windy at sea. Take care of yourself.

417
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,320
Okay, then I'll accept your gift.

418
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,720
Shouchang, I owe you three favors today.

419
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,200
In the future, you must remember to ask my return of favors.

420
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,160
What are they?

421
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
One is to help me get out of trouble.

422
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,520
Second is to lend me clothes.

423
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,800
And the third?

424
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,320
I scrounged your meal.

425
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,880
But before I had enough to eat,

426
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,080
I got chased away.

427
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,680
Then keep scrounging!

428
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,280
Can I buy you all a meal?

429
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,320
None of us has eaten yet.

430
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,840
Then we'll all scrounge along.

431
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
Good, Brother Zhongfu, this way.

432
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,440
Zhongfu, what time is it already, you're still not going to bed?

433
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,640
What is worth seeing outside?

434
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,280
The ship just passed Shandong.

435
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,400
I feel apprehensive as I come near home.

436
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,360
The ship just passed Shandong.

437
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,040
There's anger in my heart. I want to scold someone.

438
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,840
I want to scold Yuan Shikai.

439
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,280
I also want to scold this Big Head Yuan (homophone for "squanderer").

440
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,400
I don't know what he's thinking,

441
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,800
he had the guts give away Qingdao to Japan.

442
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
What would you say, did this guy take the wrong medicine (meaning, lose his mind)?

443
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,480
Yuan Shikai did not take the wrong medicine.

444
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,560
It's our country

445
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,480
that is already incurable.

446
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,720
Why do you say that?

447
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,160
Think about it.

448
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,120
Since Lin Zexu banned opium in the Daoguang era,

449
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,280
it's been seventy-five years.

450
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,600
Throughout this entire time, how many people

451
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,800
thought of different ways

452
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,720
but still couldn't save the Great Qing dynasty.

453
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,480
Sun Yat-sen introduced the Republic from the West,

454
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,560
our compatriots all thought that this

455
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,080
was a remedy to save the country and enrich the people.

456
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,360
Who would have thought, the republic works in other countries,

457
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,520
but inside of China, it does not work anymore.

458
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,760
After three or four years of the Republic,

459
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,400
the country is somehow even worse than it used to be.

460
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,720
Since there is no cure,

461
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,560
then isn't it easier to take the old way.

462
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,280
This type of sentiments is not shared just by one or two people.

463
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,320
Baisha.

464
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,520
Isn't it the case?

465
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,840
You know what, that Liang Shiyi's gang is now

466
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,880
jumping up and down in tandem everywhere.

467
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Even Yang Hugong (Yang Du, politician), Yan Jidao (Yan Fu, military officer, newspaper editor, translator and writer, known for introducing western ideas to China)

468
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
also serving their tiger master to make a scene.

469
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,600
Preposterous.

470
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,680
Yang Du, Yan Fu.

471
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,960
They are the wisest who can have a momentary lapse in judgment.

472
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,760
Whereas that Liang Shiyi group

473
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,720
are political hooligans with no moral bottom line.

474
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,800
I made up a name for them

475
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
called Li Yilian.
(lit. propriety, righteousness, honesty)

476
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,160
Li Yilian, what does this mean?

477
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,480
Li Yilian -- lacking shame!
(lit. propriety, righteousness, honesty, and a sense of shame; upheld as the "four social bonds" in ancient China)

478
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,640
Extremely shameless! Most shameless of all!

479
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,840
Brilliant! What a good Li Yilian!

480
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,600
Zhongfu, your thinking is clearly extraordinary!

481
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,760
Baisha, I'm ashamed.

482
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,000
For more than ten years,

483
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,640
I, Chen Duxiu, first learned after Kang Liang (Kang Youwei & Liang Qichao),

484
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,320
followed by [Sun] Yat-sen,

485
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,240
committed to the political revolution,

486
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
rushing about, escaping death many times.

487
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,880
I have escaped to Japan alone for five times.

488
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,160
As a result, however,

489
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,920
nothing is achieved still, right?

490
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
In terms of the future of China,

491
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,520
political revolution alone

492
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,840
won't solve the fundamental problem.

493
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,440
To get to the bottom of this, we must change our way of thinking.

494
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,920
Do you have any new ideas?

495
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,440
I wouldn't dare to call them new ideas.

496
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,880
but on my return this time,

497
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,880
I've made up my mind.

498
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,080
For twenty years, I'm not going to touch upon politics.

499
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,720
If you're not going to touch upon politics, then what do you want to do?

500
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,040
Be reborn. Change the body, change the mind.

501
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,720
It's late now.

502
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,120
Hurry up and go to sleep.

503
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,960
Zhongfu, what time is it already?

504
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
What are you still sitting there for?

505
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,080
It's so dark out there,

506
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,960
you can't see anything at all.

507
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,040
Go to bed now. Turn off the lights, okay?

508
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,960
I do see.

Students of our generation,

510
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,240
[Waseda University dormitory]
especially among the people, should bear great responsibilities.

[Waseda University dormitory]
Those who research the spiritual realms (i.e., liberal arts and social science)

512
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,400
should produce beautiful literature

513
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,400
and noble thinking

514
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,360
to contribute to the spiritual development of our nation.

515
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,960
Those who research material realms (i.e., natural science)

516
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,400
should frequently express their profound thinking

517
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,640
and apply them exquisitely in real life

518
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,080
to seek the development of our country's military technology and instruments.

519
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,400
The power of spirit is omnipotent,

520
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,680
and if held with sincerity and perseverance,

521
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,480
one will lead a magnificent and meaningful endeavor.

Brother Fengzai, I say, you are really capable.

527

You have everything prepared here!

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,200
If we were in the fourth class cabin,

533
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,240
next to the pauper,

534
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
It would have been so boring!

535
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,080
Right! So boring!

536
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,440
All of these are not worth mentioning.

537
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,200
My second uncle said

538
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
When Yuan Shikai becomes the emperor,

539
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,960
he will be the head of imperial palace affairs.

540
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
When you return home, help us with more publicity.

541
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,120
When the time comes, I will give you your due.

542
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,800
No problem!

543
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,600
West wind (mah-jong tile name).

544
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,640
I say, Brother Fengzai,

545
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,800
for the sake of Yuan Shikai,

546
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,640
we've already given up our opportunities go study abroad.

547
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,760
You have to tell your second uncle about it, right?

548
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,400
Let me guess,

549
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,720
you're all having the same doubts?

550
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,840
Of course!

551
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,080
Okay!

552
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,400
Then let me help you all clear these doubts.

553
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,320
My second uncle says,

554
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,800
as long as the work is done,

555
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,040
we can all go study at Peking University.

556
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,320
Are you serious?

557
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,320
Then we will have boundless prospects.

558
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,160
This is great! Peking University!

559
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,240
I was just waiting for this promise from you!

560
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,840
Zhongfu!

561
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,120
Somebody made way for you,

562
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,240
why didn't you acknowledge them?

563
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,320
This is unreasonable.

564
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,760
Who is this person?

565
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,160
He is a famous Chinese United League (Tongmenghui) veteran,

566
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,040
General Zou Yongcheng, commander of the Third Army of Hunan-Henan Coalition Forces.

567
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,400
You need to give him an apology.

568
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,360
I've always been uninterested in bureaucrats.

569
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,640
Look at you!

Greetings General Zou.

Mr. Zhongfu
[Zou Yongcheng, styled Qizhi, Chinese United League member]

575
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:09,080
Mr. Zhongfu

576
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,360
General Zou isn't just any official.

577
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,360
In the second year or the Republic, when Song Jiaoren (political leader and a founder of KMT) was assassinated,

578
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,320
General Zou deeply felt that the Republic would fall apart.

579
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,760
He left a suicide poem,

580
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,000
jumped into the Huangpu River in anger to commit suicide.

581
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,000
"After more than ten years of vigorous revolution,

582
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,920
Hu Lu (initially referring to Xiongnu, later extended to general northern invading nomads such as the ruling Manchus of Qing) was expelled with their ancestral whip.

583
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,520
Only to find that the ape (homophone of Yuan) somersaulted out,

584
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,680
the Republic becomes a dream and I shall return to Heaven."

585
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,200
How noble and majestic!

586
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,440
Not really, I'm ashamed of the being an incompetent.

587
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,280
Jumping into Huangpu River to commit suicide.

588
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,440
Just an attempt?

589
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,440
Indeed, it was an attempt.

590
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,120
Luckily I was rescued by fishermen.

591
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,360
If so,

592
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,000
I actually think you are a fool.

593
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,320
How can a revolutionary kill himself so easily?

594
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,560
I, Chen Duxiu, in this life,

595
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,320
would never do anything stupid to kill myself and alienate myself from the revolution.

596
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,880
Zhongfu!

597
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,000
General Zou, I apologize.

598
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,280
It's alright.

599
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,142
Zhongfu!

600
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:10,825
Zhongfu!

601
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,840
You were too overbearing.

602
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
Being ruthless does not make you a true hero.

603
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Maybe one day,

604
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,440
I will also be like Qu Yuan (poet and politician during the Warring State period, known for his patriotism),

605
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,320
jumping into a river to commit suicide for my country.

606
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,080
At that time, will you also come ridicule me?

607
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,560
Sorry, Baisha.

608
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm not in a good mood, I forgot my manners.

609
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,720
Forgive me.

611

Yannian, Qiaonian, those two unfilial sons

613
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,360
were not at home taking care of their mother

614
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,080
but recently came to Shanghai as well.

615
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,200
Poor woman, she is both an aunt and a stepmother,

616
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,480
She's sick with no money,

617
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,480
and has to take care of a family with five to six people.

618
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,000
I really don't know

619
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,960
how they would survive.

620
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,560
You... This way of managing the family is questionable.

621
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,680
I heard you insist on not covering

622
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,200
living expenses for the two brothers, Yannian and Qiaonian,

623
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,560
and instead, leaving them to work while studying,

624
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,680
providing for themselves.

625
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,360
At such a young age,

626
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,880
who can take this kind of suffering?

627
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,560
Why can't they take this kind of suffering?

628
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,240
If I had money I still wouldn't give it to them.

629
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,720
Not to mention, I don't have any money.

711
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,320
Don't move, alright.

712
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,720
What are you messing around for? Quickly!

713
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,120
Take your legs out.

714
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,160
Put on your shoes.

715
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,560
You don't even want your shoes on now, huh?

716
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,840
Let go! Let go!

717
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,720
Let go of me.

718
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,543
What's going on?

719
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:47,615
What's going on?

720
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,920
Let go of me!

721
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,640
You guys can't be like this!

722
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,480
Stop right now! What do you guys want to do!

723
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,320
Let go. Let go of me!

724
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,200
Get your hands off of me!

725
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,000
What are you guys doing!

726
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,640
You can't be like this!

727
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,200
Let go of me!

728
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,360
What are you doing

729
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,560
Let go of me!

730
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,000
They're hurting someone!

731
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,120
That's a girl!

732
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,880
What are you doing?

733
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,960
Let go! Let go!

734
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,640
Hands off! Take your hands off right now!

735
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,320
What the heck is going on down there?

736
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,520
A live performance of "Romance of the Western Chamber" on board!

737
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,480
Let me go!

738
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,840
Out of the way!

739
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,720
Stop fighting!

740
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,840
Who!

741
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,367
Who did it?

742
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:29,229
Who did it?

743
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,000
Who threw it?

744
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,400
What are you guys doing?

745
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,400
Do you want to steal money or jump into the sea and escape?

746
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,680
Our boat tickets were stolen!

747
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,120
That's why we came on the deck!

748
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,240
Don't strike!

749
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,800
Just forget it!

750
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,000
Let go!

751
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,640
Just forget it!

752
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,865
Stop fighting!

753
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:58,571
Stop fighting!

754
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,000
Great!

755
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,960
Stop the ruckus!

756
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,240
You are supposed to be quiet and courteous here.

757
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,520
We are on the ocean.

758
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,440
This boat belongs to Japan.

759
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,120
People who don't have a boat ticket must buy one.

760
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,680
So, everyone, please understand that

761
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,240
we conducted a secret investigation

762
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,800
and found out that those two originally did not have boat tickets.

763
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,920
Therefore

764
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,360
these two must buy boat tickets.

765
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,320
Let these two youths off.

766
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,240
As for the boat tickets, I'll pay for them.

767
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Okay, as long as the tickets are purchased.

768
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,600
It's not okay! You guys...

769
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,200
You have to apologize to the young Chinese couple.

770
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,240
This is our Japanese ocean liner,

771
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,520
we are carrying out official business.

772
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,840
There is no reason to apologize, you guys better not go too far.

773
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,680
Is beating people part of carrying out official business?

774
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,080
Is humiliating a woman part of carrying out official business?

775
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Is taking off a girl's clothes part of carrying out official business?

776
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm telling you guys...

777
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,280
you Japanese people are abusing your power,

778
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,800
willfully insulting us Chinese people.

779
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,320
This is an insult to our China!

780
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,840
This is the high seas!

781
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,560
This matter

782
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,720
is big enough to cause an international incident.

783
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,600
Are you trying to

784
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,280
cause enough troubles out of hand?

785
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,529
Apologize!

786
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,372
Apologize!

787
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,000
Apologize! Apologize!

788
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,628
Apologize!

789
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:19,829
Apologize!

790
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,275
Apologize! Apologize!

791
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,640
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Bad guys, apologize!

792
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,937
Apologize! Apologize!

793
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,640
Apologize! Apologize!

794
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,320
Apologize! Apologize!

795
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,880
Okay! I got it!

796
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,600
You two quickly apologize.

797
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,520
Sorry. Sorry.

798
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,800
Hey, let's go!

799
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,625
We won!

800
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,840
We won!

801
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
We won!

802
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,480
This is the victory? What did you win?

803
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,160
Just three words "I am sorry", and it's over?

804
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,200
That's right!

805
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,400
Does this count as victory?

806
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,920
Keep fighting!

807
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,280
Come back and keep fighting!

808
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,640
What are you saying!

809
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,760
Are you still human?

810
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,360
Seeing your fellow citizen being bullied...

811
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,240
not coming out to lend a hand...

812
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,520
instead, you are on the side making sarcastic remarks.

813
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,640
Are you still Chinese?

814
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,400
Do you still know what shame is?

815
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,880
You know what shame is,

816
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,960
what's the point of showing off here?

817
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,040
If you are so capable, go join the battle in Europe,

818
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,800
go exterminate the Eight-Nation Alliance.

819
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,440
That's right!

820
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,240
That's what is called capability.

821
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,800
You!

822
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,080
What do you want to do?

823
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,520
A Chinese person beating another Chinese?

824
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,720
Come.

825
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,720
Let all the foreigners see clearly...

826
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,960
how Chinese people bully each other.

827
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,840
Come.

828
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,640
Do you see it?

829
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,480
Chinese people are bullying each other!

830
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,760
Come!  Everyone, come and see!

831
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,800
Stop quarreling, all of you go back now!

832
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,400
Go away.

833
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,425
All of you go back.

834
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:43,177
Back to your cabin.

835
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,200
Don't be angry, don't lower yourself to their level.

836
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,560
Step aside.

837
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,520
Raise your foot a little.

838
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,720
You are stepping on my tile.

839
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,000
What tile?

840
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,840
Little... Little chick it seems like.

841
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,400
You eyesight seems pretty poor.

842
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,520
It's a cake.

843
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,360
Play often?

844
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,480
Why did you throw away the tile!

845
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,560
Fellow countrymen being insulted

846
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,640
is far less important

847
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,520
than your mah-jong game, right?

848
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,360
What the hell does this have to do with playing Mah-jong!

849
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,240
What did you throw away my tile for?

850
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,920
How can they be justified for sneaking on board without tickets?

851
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,240
The reason why our country is not prospering...

852
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,800
is that the people are not enlightened.

853
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,200
Do you have to go that far?!

854
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,880
Playing mah-jong...

855
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,560
has nothing to be with either he prosperity of the nation or the enlightenment of the people!

856
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,760
What did you throw away my tile for?

857
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,960
You guys still want to lose more face?

858
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,880
Us Chinese people arguing amongst ourselves here,

859
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,160
turning into laughing stocks to the foreigners.

860
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,800
Everybody, go back to your own cabin. Right now!

861
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,760
Let's go.

862
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Mr. Zhongfu, are you alright?

863
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm alright.

864
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,440
General Yongcheng,

865
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,440
Please accept my formal apology to you for 

866
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,120
my lack of manners from earlier.

867
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,680
You are a brave fellow!

868
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:05,646
That's too much of a compliment.

869
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,800
Thank you sirs!

870
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,280
Sir,

871
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,400
For the money for boat tickets

872
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,920
we will for sure repay you as soon as possible.

873
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,880
No need, no need.

874
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,320
We are all Chinese people

875
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,680
We're supposed to help each other.

876
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,640
Thank you!

877
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,320
Mr. Zhongfu.

878
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,480
You helped us, despite what happened yesterday.

879
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,160
I wholeheartedly am grateful to you.

880
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,760
What about the events of yesterday?

881
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,400
You forgot,

882
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
At Waseda,

883
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,760
I spit on you.

884
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,720
How about if I didn't forget?

885
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,840
Should I spit back at you?

886
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,600
You spit on me

887
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,120
out of your courage and uprightness.

888
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,320
Today we helped to defend you

889
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,360
out of our courage and uprightness.

890
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,960
But relying merely on courage and uprightness,

891
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,800
when will this fight ever end?

892
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,240
Do you understand the reasoning behind this?

893
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,160
I am all ears for our instructions.

894
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,200
Good.

895
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,400
Then let's go back to our cabin to chat.

896
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,320
General Yongcheng, please.

897
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Let's go.  Come on.

898
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,240
Qiaonian,

899
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,640
All set. Now I won't be afraid that it's gonna fall.

900
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:40,840
Here.

901
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,320
Brother Yannian, Brother Qiaonian!

902
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,320
What are you doing here?

903
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,280
What tasty food are you eating?

904
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,055
I also want to eat!

905
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:47,160
[Chen Zimei, daughter of Chen Duxiu]
I also want to eat!

906
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,810
[Chen Zimei, daughter of Chen Duxiu]

907
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,160
Aunt!

908
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,040
Yannian, Qiaonian.

909
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,345
[Gao Junman, wife of Chen Duxiu]

910
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,240
So hard to eat!

911
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,680
What's wrong Zimei?

912
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Don't eat this anymore.

913
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,120
Aunt brought over some buns for you guys.

914
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,880
They just came out of the boiler.

915
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,560
Eat the buns.

916
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,080
Aunt, we won't eat these.

917
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,720
Aunt is not an stranger.

918
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,160
What is it that you can't eat these?

919
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,000
You can take them.

920
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,760
Thank you aunt!

921
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,960
I brought you guys some egg soup too.

922
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,640
Here.

923
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,760
Fresh out of the pot.

924
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,800
Thank you aunt!

925
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,520
Yannian. Come, eat some buns!

926
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,240
Aunt, we did buy these naans.

927
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
It's true that they don't look good. But they're actually quite tasty! 

928
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,680
Where's Henian?

929
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,680
He's not feeling very well.

930
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,200
I had a neighbor help look after him.

931
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,560
Yannian, Qiaonian,

932
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Aunt has come here many times to convince you guys.

933
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,600
But you are always stubbornly not willing to come home with me.

934
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,960
Now that our father is about to come back,

935
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,560
come home with me.

936
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,040
We won't go back.

937
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,800
We don't have anything to do with that person.

938
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,560
But you guys working outside like this...

939
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,800
is truly onerous!

940
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,560
You can't even get a bite of something warm.

941
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,600
Come home with me please.

942
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,120
You'd after all be able to have some warm food.

943
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,320
Is that okay?

944
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,200
Aunt, please don't try to persuade us anymore.

945
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,800
We will rely on ourselves.

946
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,320
This is our principle.

947
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,400
Zimei,

948
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,480
your brothers are going to go to work.

949
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,680
This time we can't play with you.

950
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,720
Next time, okay?

951
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,160
Let's go!

952
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,000
Goodbye, aunt.

953
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,240
Wait a minute!

954
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,720
Here.

955
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,560
Take all of these buns with you!

956
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,160
Older brother, you promised that you will get me some grasshoppers!

957
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,760
It's a deal! As your brother I will keep my promises for sure!
