In 1915,

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,360
World War I

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,600
entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,920
While Germany was distracted in Europe,

7
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,960
Japan stepped up its expansion in China.

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
During the period

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,440
of the Second Revolution's failure,

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,240
Sun Zhongshan and others were forced into exile overseas.

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,280
Bourgeois revolutionaries

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,880
were unable to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end.

China was once again thrown into a tumultuous situation.

17
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,280
Mr. President,

18
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Japanese diplomat Hioki Eki has sent an ultimatum

19
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,960
to be answered within forty-eight hours.

What does he want?

28
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
Hioki Eki said:

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,480
Japan is to take over Shandong in the northeast.

30
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,640
Japanese... They still want us dead.

31
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,800
This afternoon, the Ministry of War have reported

32
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
signs that the Japanese navy

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,520
is heading to our southeast coast.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,640
What?

Does he want a war?

36
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,840
Make no mistake:

37
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,760
I am Yuan Shikai,

38
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
not Li Hongzhang.

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
For a long time, there have been discussions in Japan

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,280
advocating for Japanese intervention

41

Stupid... Stupid...

43
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,120
You didn't tell Hioki Eki that

44
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,240
it's not that I, Yuan Shikai, who disagreed with the Twenty-One Demands.

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
It's the people who are rebelling so much.

46
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,680
It was them who hid Sun Zhongshan and Huang Xing in Japan.

47
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,400
Didn't they also say they should respect public opinion?

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
Mr. President, our strategy has worked.

49
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,720
The Japanese agree that the articles in Section 5

50
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,920
can be discussed in the future.

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,360
But... the treaty must be signed immediately.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,880
What is your Foreign Ministry's response?

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,880
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs obeys the orders of the President.

54
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,080
How cunning.

55
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
Then accept the Japanese terms.

56
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,640
Now Sun Zhongshan, Huang Xing and the others will make trouble again.

57
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,880
All these people are overseas.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,000
It won't be a big deal.

59

Right.

60
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Yuntian, tell the Japanese:

61
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
the treaty will be signed,

62
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,640
but Section 5 of the demands will not be accepted.

63
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,800
This is the bottom line.

65
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
he should also give me some.

Nine days.

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,480
Then wait until the night of the ninth day

70
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,240
to inform the Japanese.

77

but the common masses do not agree

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,480
to be angry and not fight!

the grotesque situation we find ourselves in today.

169
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,760
Yuan Shikai's attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy

170
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,920
was a real return to the right track.

171
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,400
This is the way to save China.

172
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,680
The foundation of prosperity.

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,800
Nonsense!

174
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,800
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!

175
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,160
The idea of a democratic republic

176
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,760
is already well established.

177
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,440
Aren't you driving backwards in history?

178
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,640
Yeah! That's right! Driving backwards!

179
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,520
We are the ones driving backwards in history?

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,520
Or is it you revolutionaries?

181
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,680
Ignoring China's national conditions!

182
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,080
Students! Countrymen!

183
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,400
Kang Youwei has long said:

184
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,640
a revolution is not a good thing for a country.

185
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,320
The French Revolution:

186
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,880
eighty years of turmoil and bloodshed of millions.

187
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,240
Furthermore, the Chinese people are not yet open-minded.

188
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
In this case,

189
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,600
the forced imposition of a republican system

190
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,240
will be like a floating duck on water, with no roots.

191
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Zhang Fengzai, what you just said

192
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,040
is absolutely absurd!

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
The words of Kang Youwei

194
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
have been refuted by many revolutionary martyrs.

195
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
Of course the revolution will shed blood.

196
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
But I would like to ask you:

197
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,880
if a monarch is established first, will there be no bloodshed?

198
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,840
Right!

199
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,400
[Zhang Tuzhao, styled Xingyan, prominent social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Yeah! That's right!

201
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,400
Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy.

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,240
Which country has not experienced this?

203
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,600
How many times has this happened?

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
The sacrifices that have been made

205
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,320
to achieve real social progress.

206
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,080
Another thing I want to ask you is,

207
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,920
what did you just say?

208
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,840
Our country is not yet open-minded?

209
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,840
That's demonstrably false!

210
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Since the Xinhai Revolution,

211
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
the mindset of the entire population

212
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,040
has changed dramatically.

213
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,000
Judging from the unanimous rejection of Yuan at home and abroad,

214
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,520
this is hard evidence.

215
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,840
The more the nation is at stake,

216
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,880
the more the people should become aware of the situation

217
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,720
and the spirit of the nation should be revived.

218
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,360
If the idea of republicanism is to be put into practice

219
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,480
for the people,

220
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,440
it is necessary to overthrow the feudal ideology

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Zhang Fengzai, those who go against the tide of history

222
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,600
will be drowned by the torrent of the times.

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,120
For the love of our country,

224
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,000
we want to save our country. Down with Yuan.

225
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
For the sake of our Chinese nation,

226
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,320
we must save our country. Down with Yuan!

227
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:01,880
Save the country! Down with Yuan!

228
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,748
Well said!

229
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:04,720
Well said!

230
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,000
Mr. Xingyan.

231
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,240
Hello students.

232
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
What Shouchang said

233
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,640
is well-reasoned, from the heart,

234
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,600
passionate, and engaging.

235
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,800
Very good.

236
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,920
Zhongfu, what do you think?

237
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,920
Zhongfu? Chen Duxiu?

238
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,000
It's Chen Duxiu!

239
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,384
Chen Duxiu!

240
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,720
Is it Chen Duxiu?

241
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
Why does he look like that?

242
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,840
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

243
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,520
Could it be Chen Duxiu?

244
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,120
It can't be.

245
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,840
As you said,

246
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
he is a very knowledgeable young man.

247
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,960
Chen Duxiu.

248
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,600
Why are you eating here?

249
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,800
I was just passing by

250
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,480
seeing them bickering.

251
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,440
No one was eating.

252
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,920
One should never waste food at any time.

253
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,520
It's shameful to waste food

254
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,880
What time is it? You're still eating here?

255
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,840
Are you Chen Duxiu?

256
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,320
I am, yes.

257
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,200
He really is!

258
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,160
I am Chen Duxiu.

259
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,200
He is! He's Chen Duxiu!

260
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,320
Quiet, everyone!

261
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,080
Quiet!

262
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,800
Since Mr. Zhongfu is here,

263
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,240
we would like to ask you:

264
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,120
what do you think should be done to save China?

265
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,640
I think that

266
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
such a country is irredeemable.

267
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,680
What did you say?

268
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,240
Are you Chinese? How can you say that?

269
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,800
Chen Duxiu, are you talking about people?

270
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Simply shameless!

271
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,400
Shameless!

272
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,680
What are you doing?

273
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,400
You've gone too far!

274
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,720
Mr. Zhongfu, what you just said,

275
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
do you really believe that?

276
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,080
Yes, of course.

277
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,920
But yeah, I meant to say...

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
You see?!

279
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,880
Students! You have seen it!

280
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,920
This is what you call a revolutionary!

281
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,760
A great revolutionary!

282
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,600
Do you know what he said?

283
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,920
He said he didn't care for his country's subjugation!

284
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,960
What else?

285
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,160
What's terrible of being a slave to a subjugated country?

286
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,840
Where is the love for a country of a brutalized people?

287
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,640
This is the real traitor! a hanjian!

288
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
Traitor! Hanjian!

289
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
Hanjian!

290
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,280
Get out of the way!

291
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,040
Don't do it!

292
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
Let's have a good chat!

293
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,240
Don't do it!

294
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,000
Stop!

295
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,868
Don't do it!

296
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,720
Don't do it!

297
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,840
Mr. Zhongfu, go!

298
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,440
Don't do it!

299
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,240
Let's have a good chat! Don't do it!

300
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,160
Come on, this way!

301
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,240
Don't do it, people, don't do it!

302
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,120
Listen to me for a moment!

303
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,225
Mr. Xingyan has a message for everyone!

304
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,720
Mr. Xingyan has a message for everyone!

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,120
Come on, everyone, let me tell you something!

306
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Come on, come on!

307
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,920
Alright.

308
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,920
Alright, alright, no one is following.

309
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,520
Take a break, take a break.

310
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,000
Not like Chen Duxiu, right?

311
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,320
I just imagined

312
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,520
something a little different.

313
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
So what do you imagine it should be like?

314
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,680
Are you okay?

315
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,440
I apologise for the situation.

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,880
It's okay, I've seen a lot of these.

317
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,560
Your article

318
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,360
"Patriotism and Self-consciousness", I've read it.

319
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,840
But there are many doubts and unanswered questions.

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
I would like to ask you some, is that okay?

321
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,800
I know that you, Li Dazhao, are from Hebei.

322
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,320
Yanzhao is full of generous and sorrowful people, they insist endlessly.

323
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,600
But now in China

324
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,520
there is a shortage of real men who believe in the truth.

325
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,880
Ask.

326
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,680
You said that patriotism should have a stand

327
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,440
and not be willing to be Yuan Shikai's obedient people

328
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,280
in the name of patriotism.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,920
According to you,

330
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,600
as long as Yuan Shikai is in power,

331
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,880
people should not be patriotic.

332
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,960
You stubborn man, you misunderstood.

333
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,800
I meant to say,

334
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,040
patriotism should have a position.

335
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,080
You can't link patriotism with loyalty to Yuan Shikai.

336
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,200
You can't confuse

337
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,640
patriotism with loyalty to Yuan Shikai

338
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,520
to cover up Yuan Shikai's theft of the country.

339
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,120
This is similar to what you just said,

340
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
is it not?

341
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,760
This Yuan Shikai

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,640
claims that he represents the country.

343
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
He is confusing different concepts.

344
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,840
If patriotism has no position,

345
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,160
then we simply have no reason

346
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,280
to defeat Yuan Shikai.

347
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,280
I agree.

348
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,360
I think the first priority today is

349
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,000
to inspire the people to be truly patriotic.

350
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,040
Right now China is being divided up by the Western powers.

351
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
If we are not patriotic,

352
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,240
then the country will die.

353
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,800
Shouchang, I ask you:

354
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,160
What did the Western powers rely on to carve up China?

355
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,120
Gunboats.

356
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,840
No.

357
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,400
You are talking about the Opium War and the Sino-Japanese War.

358
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,160
Now the powers are dividing China by borrowing money.

359
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,080
The Chinese government

360
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,440
borrows foreign debt from Western countries every year,

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,760
accounting for more than half of the treasury's revenue

362
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
in a country without productivity.

363
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,400
Only be relying on the national tax railway as collateral

364
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,320
can we borrow money to maintain political power.

365
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,640
What do you expect from a country like this?

366
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,120
That's why we're going to overthrow Yuan,

367
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,040
overthrow this corrupt government,

368
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,400
and build a new nation.

369
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,040
No!

370
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,880
China can be saved by political revolution.

371
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,800
China's problems are accumulating.

372
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,440
Can we solve the problem by changing people and governments?

373
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,400
So, according to you,

374
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
China has no way out?

375
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,040
Yes, but the way out is not the old way.

376
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,920
The way out is a new way.

377
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
China will not die.

378
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,880
What is the old way?

379
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,240
The dynastic cycle:

380
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,600
the overthrow of an old dynasty,

381
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
the establishment of a new dynasty.

382
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,160
The cycle repeats itself. It's the old way.

383
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,200
And what is the new way?

384
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,080
Don't know.

385
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,280
That's what I'm looking for.

386
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,200
Shouchang, I appreciate your knowledge and talent.

387
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,280
Will you look for this new path with me?

388
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,480
To find a way to save China

389
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
is my life's work.

390
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,560
I will.

391
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,640
Good.

392
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,320
Zhongfu!

393
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
You've both come here

394
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,560
and made us look for you!

395
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,640
Tickets... we have the tickets.

396
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,800
Tomorrow we can go back home.

397
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,480
Excellent. Finally we can go back.

398
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,440
Zhongfu, before I go back,

399
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,120
I finally got to see Shouchang.

400
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
It's not in vain that you took

401
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,520
the crime of being a traitor.

402
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,108
Not in vain... not in vain...

403
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,040
See me?

404
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,800
Yeah.

405
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,200
He's here to see you today.

406
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,440
Ever since he was on the "The Tiger",

407
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,120
and read your article,

408
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,120
he's been wanting to see you.

409
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,160
It was worth the trip.

410
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,280
We have reaped the harvest, and we have found our treasure.

411
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,520
You... You are always bored in the room writing articles

412
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,400
not letting us care for you,

413
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,360
letting us ask questions,

414
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,040
making yourself like a beggar.

415
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,960
I've got lice all over my body.

416
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,440
[Yi Baisha, styled Yuechuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

417
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
You'll scare Junman back home!

418
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,600
Hurry back!

419
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,440
Cut your hair, take a bath and change your clothes.

420
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,800
There's a bath

421
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,560
and there is only one change of clothes.

422
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,520
Alright.

423
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,440
Zhongfu, wait!

424
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,000
It's windy at sea. Take care of yourself.

425
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,320
Okay, I'll be glad to do so.

426
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,720
Shouchang, I owe you three favours today.

427
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,200
In the future, you must remember to ask for it.

428
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,160
What are they?

429
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
One is to help me get out of trouble.

430
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,520
Second is to lend me clothes.

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,800
And the third?

432
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,320
I ate your food.

433
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,880
But I had enough to eat before

434
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,080
before it knocked me off my feet.

435
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,680
So keep rubbing it in.

436
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,280
Can I buy you all dinner?

437
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,320
We haven't even eaten yet.

438
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,840
Then we'll follow the trail.

439
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
Good, Brother Zhongfu, this way.

440
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,440
Zhongfu, what time is it already, you're still not going to sleep?

441
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,640
What is there worth seeing outside?

442
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,280
The boat passed Shandong.

443
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,400
I feel apprehensive as I near home.

444
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,360
The boat passed Shandong.

445
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,040
There's anger in my heart. I want to scold someone.

446
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,840
I want to scold Yuan Shikai.

447
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,280
I also want to scold this "Big-head" Yuan.

448
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,400
I don't know what he's thinking,

449
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,800
he dared to give Qingdao to Japan.

450
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
You say, did this guy take the wrong medicine?

451
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,480
Yuan Shikai did not take the wrong medicine.

452
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,560
It's our country

453
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,480
that is already incurable.

454
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,720
Why do you say that?

455
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,160
Think about it.

456
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,120
From years ago, when Lin Zexu forbid opium.

457
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,280
It's been a whole seventy-five years already.

458
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,600
In the middle of this, how many people

459
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,800
thought of different ways

460
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,720
but still couldn't save the Great Qing dynasty.

461
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,480
Sun Zhongshan introduced the republic from the West,

462
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,560
people of the country all thought that this

463
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,080
was a remedy to save the country and enrich the people.

464
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,360
Who would have thought, the republic works in other countries

465
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,520
but inside of China it does not work anymore.

466
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,760
After three or four years of the Republic,

467
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,400
the country is not as good as it used to be.

468
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,720
Since there is no cure,

469
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,560
then isn't taking the old way better.

470
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,280
These aren't just the thoughts of one or two people.

471
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,320
Baisha.

472
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,520
Isn't it?

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,840
Right now Liang Shiyi and his group

474
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,880
are establishing connections everywhere, moving up and down,

475
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
joining Yang Hugong, Yan Jidao

476
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
and making a big fuss.

477
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,600
Unreasonable.

478
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,680
Yang Du, Yan Fu.

479
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,960
(idiom) They are the wisest who can have a momentary lapse in judgement,

480
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,760
whereas that Liang Shiyi group

481
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,720
are political hooligans with no moral bottom line.

482
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,800
I made up a name for them

483
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
called "justice and integrity" (Li Yilian)

484
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,160
Li Yilian, what does this mean?

485
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,480
Justice and integrity, are shameless.

486
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,640
Extremely shameless! Especially shameless!

487
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,840
Good! What a good courtesy!

488
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,600
Zhongfu, your thinking is clearly unusual!

489
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,760
Baisha, I'm ashamed.

490
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,000
It's been more than ten years.

491
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,640
Chen Duxiu first learned Kang Liang,

492
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,320
followed by Zhongshan,

493
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,240
committed to the political revolution,

494
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
running this way and that way escaping death many times.

495
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,880
Five trips to Japan alone.

496
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,160
The results until now,

497
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,920
they still haven't achieved anything right?

498
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
China's matters,

499
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,520
by relying on political revolution,

500
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,840
doesn't solve the fundamental problem.

501
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,440
To get to the bottom of this, we must change our way of thinking.

502

Do you have any new ideas?

503
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,440
I don't dare to say my new ideas.

504
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,880
On my return this time,

505
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,880
I've made up my mind.

506
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,080
For twenty years, I'm not going to touch politics.

507
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,720
If you're not going to touch politics, then what do you want to do?

508
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,040
Transform myself. Replace the person, replace the brain.

509

It's not early anymore.

510
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,120
Hurry up and go to sleep.

511
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,960
Zhongfu, what time is it already?

512

What are you still sitting there for?

513
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,080

520
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,120
The study of spiritual knowledge

521
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,400
should always produce a beautiful literature,

522
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,400
to produce a noble thought,

523
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,360
to contribute to the spiritual development of our nation.

524
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,960
Those who study the material sciences

525
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,400
should always set forth their profound thoughts,

526

to the development of our military arts and instruments.

528
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,400
The spirit of the world is an all-powerful force

529
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,680
that will lead to great endeavours

if it is held with sincerity and perseverance.

Based on the slightest thought of conscience,

Cao Mo will be humiliated,

533
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,960

534
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,640
when the time comes.

535
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,840
Brother Fengzai, I say, you are really capable.

536

Things are prepared so well!

you unexpectedly got everyone ship tickets for a second class cabin.

541

At the fourth class cabin, we

That was so boring!

Right! So boring!

545

All of this doesn't mean much

My second uncle said

547
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
Yuan Shikai wants to become an emperor.

548
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,960
He's just the head of palace affairs.

549
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
When you return home, help us to do more publicity.

550
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,120
In the future, I will surely not treat everyone unfairly.

For the sake of Yuan Shikai,

555
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,640
we don't even want to go study abroad.

556
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,760
You have to tell Second Uncle about it, right?

557
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,400
I say

558
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,720
do all of you have this doubt?

559
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,840
Of course

560
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,080
Okay!

561
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,400
Then let me help you all dispel these doubts

562
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,320
My second uncle says

563
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,800
as long as work is done

564
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,040
we can all go to study at Peking University.

565
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,320
Are you serious?

566
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,320
Then we will have boundless prospects.

567
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,160
This is great! Peking University!

568

I was waiting for this sentence from you!

Somebody made way for you,

571
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,240
why did you not acknowledge them?

572
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,320
This is unreasonable.

Who is this person?

574
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,160
He is the famous senior from Tongmenghui (Sun Zhongshan's alliance for democracy).

575
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,040
General Yu Yongcheng, commander of the Third army of Xiangyu coalition.

576

You need to give him an apology.

General Yu isn't an ordinary official.

In the second year or the Republic, Song Jiaoren was killed.

585

General Yu deeply felt that the Republic would fall apart.

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,960
Isn't it fine if it's picked up

670
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,480
What the fuck does his injury have to do with me!

671
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,160
You have to take responsibility for delaying business!

672
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,120
But you still can't beat someone up!

673
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,000
I just did. So what?

674
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,280
Believe it or not I'll beat both of you together

675
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,080
What are you doing?

676
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,960
What are you doing?

677
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,480
Don't hit!

678
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,360
You can't fight!

679
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,276
Want to rebel, is that right?

680
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,229
Want to rebel, is that right!

681
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,440
You are quite a righteous brat, huh?

682
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,160
Fine, today I'll let you handle this first issue.

683
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,840
Old Jia's life, you take care of.

684
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,200
All of you can't get involved.

685
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,320
Whoever comes out will do it themselves.

686
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,040
Come!

687
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,400
I'll do it.

688
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,120
Me too.

689
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,720
Count me in!

690
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,800
Since you two volunteered, you two do it.

691
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,600
Come!

692
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,960
No more nonsense!

693
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,880
Come!

694
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,160
Who's next? Break it up!

695
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,840
What are you still looking at? Scatter!

696
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,240
Turn over these two.

697
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,280
It's nothing, all of you go back to work!

698
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,680
Grab here.

699
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,320
Okay.

700
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,080
Here!

701
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:42,583
Lift

702
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:46,257
Lift

703
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,320
All right all right. Go do your job.

704
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,600
What are you being distracted for!

705
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,960
Pick up those beans cleanly for me.

706
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,480
If you miss even one grain, I'll kill you.

707
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,840
Quickly!

708
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,560
Hurry up!

709
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:01,960
Older brother.

710
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,080
I can't hold on anymore.

711
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,520
Hurry and put it down! Don't injure your waist.

712
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,520
That's not it, my waistband broke.

713
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,960
Well then...

714
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,400
Put your legs together!

715
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,320
Don't move, alright.

716
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,720
What are you messing around for? Quickly!

717
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,120
Take your legs out.

718
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,160
Put on your shoes.

719
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,560
You don't even want your shoes on now, huh?

720
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,840
Let go! Let go!

721
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,720
Let go of me.

722
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,543
What's going on?

723
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:47,615
What's going on?

724
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,920
Let go of me!

725
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,640
You guys can't be like this!

726
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,480
Stop right now! What do you guys want to do!

727
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,320
Let go. Let go of me

728
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,200
Get your hands off of me!

729
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,000
What are you guys doing!

730
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,640
You can't be like this!

731
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,200
Let go of me!

732
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,360
What are you doing

733
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,560
Let go of me!

734
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,000
They're hurting someone!

735
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,120
That's a girl!

736
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,880
What are you doing?

737
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,960
Let go! Let go!

738
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,640
Hands off! Take your hands off right now!

739
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,320
What the heck is going on down there?

740
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,520
Throw them overboard at portside!

741
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,480
Let me go!

742
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,840
Out of the way

743
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,720
Stop fighting

744
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,840
Who!

745
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,367
Who did it?

746
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:29,229
Who did it?

747
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,000
Who threw it?

748
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,400
What are you guys doing?

749
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,400
Do you want to steal money or jump into the sea and run away?

750
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,680
Our boat tickets were stolen!

751
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,120
We just arrived on deck!

752
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,240
Don't hit!

753
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,800
Just forget it!

754
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,000
Let go!

755
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,640
Just forget it!

756
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,865
Stop fighting!

757
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:58,571
Stop fighting!

758
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,000
Good!

759
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,960
Stop the ruckus!

760
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,240
It's forbidden to make a ruckus here.

761
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,520
We are on the ocean.

762
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,440
This boat belongs to Japan.

763
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,120
People who don't have a boat ticket must buy one.

764
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,680
So, everyone don't misunderstand

765
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,240
We conducted an investigation in secret

766
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,800
and found out that those two originally did not have boat tickets,

767
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,920
therefore

768
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,360
these two must buy boat tickets.

769
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,320
Let these two youths off

770
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,240
The boat tickets, I'll pay for.

771
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Okay as long as the tickets are purchased, it's fine.

772
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,600
It's not okay! You guys...

773
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,200
You have to apologize to these two Chinese youngsters.

774
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,240
This is our Japanese ocean liner

775
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,520
we are carrying out official business.

776
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,840
There is no reason to apologize, you guys better not go too far.

777
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,680
Is beating people carrying out official business?

778
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,080
Is humiliating a woman carrying out official business?

779
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Is taking off a girl's clothes carrying out official business?

780
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm telling you guys...

781
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,280
you Japanese people are abusing your power,

782
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,800
wantonly insulting us Chinese people.

783
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,320
This is an insult to our China!

784
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,840
This is international waters!

785
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,560
This is

786
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,720
a big matter that is enough to cause an international incident.

787
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,600
Will you stop

788
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,280
messing around before this matter gets out of hand?

789
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,529
Apologize!

790
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,372
Apologize!

791
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,000
Apologize! Apologize!

792
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,628
Apologize!

793
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:19,829
Apologize!

794
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,275
Apologize!  Apologize!

795
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,640
Apologize!  Apologize!  Apologize!  Bad guys, apologize!

796
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,937
Apologize!   Apologize!

797
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,640
Apologize!   Apologize!

798
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,320
Apologize!   Apologize!

799
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,880
Okay! I got it

800
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,600
You two quickly apologize

801
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,520
Sorry   Sorry

802
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,800
Hey Let's go

803
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,625
We won!

804
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,840
We won!

805
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
We won!

806
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,480
This is the victory?  What was the victory?

807
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,160
The three words "I am sorry", and it's over?

808
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,200
That's right!

809
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,400
Does this count as victory?

810
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,920
Keep fighting!

811
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,280
Come back and keep fighting

812
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,640
What are you saying!

813
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,760
Are you still human?

814
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,360
Seeing your fellow citizen being bullied...

815
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,240
not coming out to lend a hand...

816
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,520
instead, you are on the side making sarcastic remarks

817
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,640
Are you still Chinese?

818
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,400
Do still know what shame is?

819
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,880
You know what shame is,

820
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,960
what's the point of showing off here?

821
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,040
If you have the ability fight a battle in Europe,

822
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,800
you would exterminate the Eight-Nation Alliance.

823
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,440
That's right!

824
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,240
That's what is called ability

825
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,800
You!

826
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,080
What do you want to do?

827
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,520
A Chinese people fighting each other

828
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,720
Come

829
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,720
Let foreigners properly see...

830
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,960
how Chinese people bully each other

831
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,840
Come

832
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,640
Do you see it?

833
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,480
Chinese people are bullying each other!

834
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,760
Come  Everyone come see

835
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,800
Stop quarrelling, all of you go back for me

836
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,400
Let's go

837
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,425
All of you go back

838
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:43,177
All of you go back

839
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,200
Don't be angry, don't lower yourself to their level

840
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,560
Make way

841
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,520
Raise your feet a little

842
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,720
You stepped on my tile

843
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,000
What tile?

844
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,840
Little... Little chick it seems like

845
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,400
This eyesight of yours is not good

846
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,520
It's a cake

847
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,360
Play often?

848
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,480
Why did you throw the tile!

849
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,560
Fellow citizens being insulted 

850
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,640
is far less important

851
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,520
than your mahjong game, is it?

852
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,360
What does this hell does have to do with playing Mahjong!

853
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,240
What did you throw my tile for?

854
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,920
How can they be justified in taking tickets?

855
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,240
The reason why the country is not prospering...

856
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,800
is that the people's wisdom is not yet open.

857
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,200
Meaning?!

858
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,880
Playing mahjong...

859
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,560
What does it matter whether the people are open or not?

860
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,760
What did you throw my tiles for?

861
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,960
You guys still want to lose face?

862
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,880
Us Chinese people arguing amongst ourselves here...

863
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,160
We let the foreigners see a joke

864
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,800
Everyone else, go back to your cabin. Right now

865
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,760
Let's go

866
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Mr. Zhongfu, are you alright? 

867
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm alright

868
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,440
General Yongcheng

869
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,440
My discourteousness from before

870
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,120
I formally apologize to you

871
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,680
You are a fellow 

872
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:05,646
I'm ashamed

873
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,800
Thank you sirs

874
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,280
Sir,

875
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,400
The boat ticket money...

876
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,920
We will for sure return it to you as soon as possible

877
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,880
No need no need

878
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,320
We are all Chinese people

879
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,680
Helping each other is what we should do

880
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,640
Thank you

881
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,320
Mr. Zhongfu.

882
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,480
Your help, despite what happened yesterday,

883
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,160
I wholeheartedly thank you

884
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,760
What about the events of yesterday?

885
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,400
You forgot

886
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
At Waseda,

887
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,760
I spit a mouthful on you

888
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,720
How about if I didn't forget

889
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,840
spitting back at you

890
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,600
You spit a mouthful of phlegm on me

891
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,120
it's your bravery

892
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,320
Today's fight...

893
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,360
is our bravery

894
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,960
But it's only by bravery

895
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,800
This fight is going to last until when?

896
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,240
The principles in this, do you understand?

897
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,160
I will wholeheartedly listen to your instructions 

898
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,200
Good

899
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,400
Then let's go inside the cabins to chat

900
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,320
General Yongcheng, please

901
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Let's go.   Come.

902
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,240
Qiaonian

903
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,640
Good  Now I won't be afraid of it falling 

904
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:40,840
Here 

905
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,320
Brother Yannian, Brother Qiaonian!

906
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,320
What are you doing here?

907
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,280
What good food are you eating?

908
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,160
I also want to eat!

909
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:48,810
[Chen Zimei, daughter of Chen Duxiu]

910
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,160
Aunt!

911
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,040
Yannian, Qiaonian.

912
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,345
[Gao Junman, wife of Chen Duxiu]

913
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,240
So hard to eat!

914
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,680
What's wrong Zimei?

915
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Don't eat this anymore.

916
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,120
Aunt brought over some buns for you guys.

917
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,880
It just came out of the boiler.

918
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,560
Eat the buns.

919
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,080
Aunt, we won't eat it.

920
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,720
Aunt is not an foreigner.

921
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,160
What is it that you can't eat.

922
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,000
You eat it

923
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,760
Thank you aunt

924
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,960
I brought you guys egg soup 

925
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,640
Here

926
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,760
Fresh out of the pot

927
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,800
Thank you aunt

928
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,520
Yannian. Come, eat some buns

929
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,240
Aunt, money is used to buy this

930
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
When you look at it, it doesn't look good. Once you eat it, it's quite flavorful

931
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,680
Where's Henian

932
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,680
He's not feeling very well

933
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,200
I had a neighbour help look after him

934
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,560
Yannian, Qiaonian

935
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Aunt has come here many times to urge you guys...

936
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,600
You guys are always stubbornly not willing to come home with me

937
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,960
Your father is about to come back

938
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,560
Come home with aunt

939
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,040
We won't go back

940
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,800
We don't have anything to do with this person

941
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,560
But you guys working outside like this...

942
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,800
is truly a lot of hardship

943
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,560
Can't even get hot food to eat

944
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,600
Come home with me

945
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,120
Good or bad, you can eat something hot

946
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,320
Okay?

947
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,200
Aunt, don't try to persuade us anymore

948
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,800
We will rely on ourselves

949
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,320
This is our principle

950
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,400
Zimei

951
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,480
Your brothers are going to go to work

952
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,680
This time we can't accompany you to play

953
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,720
Next time, okay

954
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,160
Let's go

955
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,000
Goodbye aunt

956
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,240
Wait a minute

957
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,720
Here

958
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,560
Take these all of these buns

959
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,160
Older brother, you agreed that I would send you my grasshopper

960
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,760
Brother promised you, I will do it for sure
