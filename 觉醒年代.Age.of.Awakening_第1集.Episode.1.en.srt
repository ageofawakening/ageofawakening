[Episode One]

00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,880
In 1915,

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,360
World War I

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,600
entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,920
While Germany was distracted in the European theater,

7
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,960
Japan stepped up its expansion in China.

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
During this time period,

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,440
since the Second Revolution's failure,
(Second Revolution: 1913 revolt by the governors of several southern Chinese provinces as well as supporters of Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang against the Beiyang government of the Republic of China led by Yuan Shikai.)

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,240
Sun Yat-sen and others were forced into exile overseas.

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,280
Bourgeois revolutionaries

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,880
were unable to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end.

13

Domestic political chaos,

14

the unbearable suffering of the people,

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,920
internal trouble and external aggression

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,640
had once again thrown China into turmoil.

17
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,280
Mr. President,

18
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Japanese diplomat Hioki Eki has sent an ultimatum

19
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,960
to be answered within forty-eight hours.

20
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,920
What does the ultimatum say?

25
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,560
then Japan will take necessary measures.

What does he want?

28
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
Hioki Eki said

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,480
Japan is to take over Shandong as they took over the northeast.

30
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,640
The Japanese... They still want us dead.

31
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,800
This afternoon, the Ministry of War reported

32
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
that Japanese naval formations

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,520
are heading for our southeast coast.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,640
What?

35
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,840
Does he still want another Jiawu War (=First Sino-Japanese War)?

36
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,840
Make no mistake.

37
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,760
I am Yuan Shikai,

38
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
not Li Hongzhang.
(Li Hongzhang: politician, general and diplomat of the late Qing dynasty, who directed Chinese forced during the First Sino-Japanese War)

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
For a long time, there have been discussions in Japan

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,280
advocating for Japanese intervention

41
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,080

42

Useless... Useless...

43
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,120
Didn't you tell Hioki Eki that

44
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,240
it's not that I, Yuan Shikai, who disagreed with the Twenty-One Demands?

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
It's the people who are rebelling so much.

46
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,680
When they (the Japanese) hid Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing in Japan,

47
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,400
didn't they say we should respect public opinion?

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
Mr. President, our appeal has worked.

49
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,720
The Japanese agree that the articles in Section 5 (which will give Japan decisive voice in China's financing, policing and governmental affairs)

50
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,920
can be discussed later.

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,360
But... the treaty must be signed immediately.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,880
What's the response of Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,880
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs obeys the orders of the President.

54
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,080
How cunning!

55
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
Then just accept the terms of the Japanese.

56
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,640
Now Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and the others will make trouble again.

57
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,880
All these people have gone overseas.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,000
It won't be a big deal.

59
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:16,600
Right.

60
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Runtian, tell the Japanese

61
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
the treaty will be signed,

62
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,640
but the articles in Section 5 cannot be accepted.

63
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,800
This is the bottom line.

64
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
I gave him face,

65
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
he should also give me some.

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,400
Understood, Mr. President.

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Which day is the deadline proposed by the Japanese?

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,320
The ninth.

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,480
Then wait until the evening of the ninth

70
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,240
to inform the Japanese.

71
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,880
Extra! Extra!

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,120
Today's extra is very strange!

73

President Yuan Shikai

74
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,440
is selling out the country!

75
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,680
The wastrel, sells, sells, sells!

76
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,160
His backbone simply has no strength.

77
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,480
But the common masses won't say yes,

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,480
they were seized with fury and wrath.

79
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,600
Look at this woman! So angry, she stomps on the extra!

80
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,200
Look at this man! So angry, he breaks his crutch!

Yuan Shikai ordered the

83
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,920
signing with Japan a treaty of national betrayal and humiliation --

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
the Twenty-One Demands.

85
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
According to this treaty,

86
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,840
China will recognize Japan's inheritance of

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,240
all German rights and interests in Shandong.

88

90

Japan will acquire, in China,

91

various railway construction rights, and so on.

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,680
who ignored China's national conditions?

182
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,080
Students! Countrymen!

183
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,400
Kang Youwei has long said

184
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,640
a revolution is not a good thing for a country.

185
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,320
The French Revolution,

186
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,880
eighty years of turmoil and bloodshed of millions.

187
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,240
Furthermore, the Chinese people are not yet enlightened.

188
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
In this case,

189
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,600
the forced imposition of a republican system

190
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,240
will be like duckweed floating on water, with no roots!

191
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Zhang Fengzai, what you just said

192
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,040
is absolutely absurd!

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Kang Youwei's words

194
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
have been refuted by many revolutionary martyrs.

195
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
The revolution will certainly shed blood.

196
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
But I would like to ask you,

197
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,880
will the constitutional monarchy not shed any blood?

198
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,840
Right!

199
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,679
[Zhang Shizhao, styled Xingyan, famous social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Yeah! Good point!

201
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,400
Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy,

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,240
which one of these countries has not experienced

203
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,600
many changes

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
and made great sacrifices,

205
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,320
before it has achieved real social progress?

206
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,080
Another thing I want to ask you is,

207
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,920
what did you mean when you just said

208
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,840
our people are not yet enlightened?

209
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,840
That's demonstrably false!

210
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Since the Xinhai Revolution,

211
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
the entire population's thinking

212
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,040
has already undergone earth-shaking changes.

213
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,000
The unanimous rejection of Yuan at home and abroad

214
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,520
is the solid evidence of that!

215
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,840
The more the nation is in peril,

216
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,880
the more it should awaken people's consciousness

217
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,720
and invigorate the national spirit.

218
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,360
And if the idea of republicanism

219
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,480
is to be instilled in the people,

220
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,440
it is necessary to overthrow the feudal ideology.

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Zhang Fengzai, those who go against the tide of history

222
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,600
will be drowned by the torrent of the times.

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,120
For the love of country,

224
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,000
we must save our country and overthrow Yuan.

225
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
For our Chinese nation,

226
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,320
we must save our country and overthrow Yuan!

227
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:01,880
Save the country! Overthrow Yuan!

228
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,748
Well said!

229
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:04,640
Well said!

230
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,000
Mr. Xingyan. Mr. Xingyan.

231
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,240
Hello students.

232
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
Shouchang's words

233
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,640
not only were on just grounds, but also came from the bottom of his heart,

234
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,600
impassioned, engaging and on point.

235
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,800
Excellent!

236
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,920
Zhongfu, what do you think?

237
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,920
Zhongfu? Chen Duxiu?

238
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,000
This is Chen Duxiu?

239
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,384
Chen Duxiu!

240
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,720
Is this Chen Duxiu?

241
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
Why does he look like that?

242
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:37,009
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, famous revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

243
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,520
Could it be Chen Duxiu?

244
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,120
It can't be.

245
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,840
As you said,

246
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
he is a very intelligent young man.

247
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,960
Chen Duxiu.

248
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,600
Why are you eating here?

249
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,800
I was just passing by

250
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,480
seeing them bickering.

251
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,440
No one was eating.

252
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,920
Food should not be wasted at any time.

253
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,520
It's shameful to waste food.

254
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,880
What time is it? You're still eating here?

255
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,840
Are you Chen Duxiu?

256
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,320
I am, yes.

257
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,200
He really is!

258
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,160
I am Chen Duxiu.

259
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,200
He is! He's Chen Duxiu!

260
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,320
Quiet, everyone!

261
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,080
Quiet!

262
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,800
Since Mr. Zhongfu is here,

263
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,240
we would like to ask you,

264
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,120
what should be done to save China in your opinion?

265
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,640
I think that

266
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
such a country is beyond saving.

267
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,680
What did you say?

268
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,240
Are you a Chinese? How dare you say that?

269
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,800
Chen Duxiu. Are you talking in human language?

270
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Simply shameless!

271
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,400
Shameless!

272
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,680
What are you doing?

273
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,400
You've gone too far!

274
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,720
Mr. Zhongfu, is what you just said

275
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
really what you think?

276
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,080
Yes, of course.

277
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,920
But, what I meant to say...

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
You see?!

279
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,880
Students! You have seen it!

280
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,920
This is your so called revolutionary!

281
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,760
A great revolutionary!

282
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,600
Do you know what he once said?

283
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,920
He said he didn't care for his country's subjugation!

284
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,960
What else?

285
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,160
What's terrible of being a slave to a subjugated country?

286
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,840
What's lovable about a country of brutalized people?

287
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,640
This is the real traitor! A hanjian!

288
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
Traitor! Hanjian!

289
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
Hanjian!

290
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,280
Get out of the way!

291
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,040
Don't strike

292
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
Let's just talk!

293
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,240
Don't do it!

294
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,000
Stop!

295
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,868
Don't strike

296
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,720
Don't do it!

297
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,840
Mr. Zhongfu, go!

298
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,440
Don't do it!

299
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,240
Let's just talk! Don't strike!

300
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,160
Come on, this way!

301
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,240
Don't do it, people, calm down!

302
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,120
Listen to me for a moment!

303
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,225
Mr. Xingyan has a message for everyone!

304
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,720
Mr. Xingyan has a message for everyone!

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,120
Come on, everyone, allow me to say something here.

306
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Come on, come on!

307
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,920
Alright.

308
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,920
Alright, alright, no one is following.

309
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,520
Take a break, take a breather.

310
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm nothing like Chen Duxiu, right?

311
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,320
Just a little different from

312
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,520
my imagination.

313
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
So what do you imagine I should be?

314
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,680
Are you okay?

315
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,440
I apologize for the situation.

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,880
It's okay, I've seen a lot of these.

317
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,560
Your article

318
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,360
"Self Consciousness on Patriotism", I've read it.

319
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,840
But I have many doubts and questions.

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
I would like to seek you explanation, is that okay?

321
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,800
I know that you, Li Dazhao, are from Hebei.

322
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,320
Yanzhao (=Hebei in Warring States period) is known for its fervent and sorrowful people, they insist relentlessly.

323
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,600
But China nowadays

324
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,520
is in need of real heroes who insist relentlessly.

325
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,880
Please ask your questions.

326
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,680
You said that patriotism should have a position,

327
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,440
and that we should not, under the pretext of patriotism,

328
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,280
be one of Yuan Shikai's obedient subjects.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,920
Then according to you,

330
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,600
as long as Yuan Shikai is in power,

331
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,880
people should not be patriotic.

332
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,960
You stubborn man, you misunderstood.

333
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,800
I meant to say,

334
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,040
patriotism should have a position,

335
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,080
and patriotism should not be confused

336
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,200
with loyalty to Yuan Shikai,

337
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,640
or covering up Yuan Shikai's usurp of state power,

338
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,520
under the pretext of patriotism.

339
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,120
This is similar to what the statements you made earlier,

340
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
is it not?

341
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,760
That Yuan Shikai

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,640
keeps saying that he represents the country.

343
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
He is deliberately confusing different concepts.

344
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,840
If patriotism has no position,

345
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,160
then we simply have no reason

346
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,280
to overthrow Yuan Shikai.

347
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,280
I completely agree.

348
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,360
I think the top priority today is

349
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,000
to inspire the people to be truly patriotic.

350
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,040
Right now, China is being divided up by the Western powers.

351
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
If everyone is not patriotic,

352
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,240
then the country will definitely perish.

353
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,800
Shouchang, let me I ask you,

354
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,160
what are the Western powers relying on to carve up China?

355
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,120
Their powerful navies and strong weaponry.

356
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,840
No!

357
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,400
You are talking about the Opium War and naval failure of the Jiawu War.

358
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,160
Now the foreign powers are dividing China by giving loans.

359
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,080
The Chinese government

360
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,440
borrows foreign debt from Western countries every year,

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,760
accounting for more than half of the treasury's revenue.

362
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
In a country without productivity,

363
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,400
it relies exclusively on putting up its national tax and railways as collaterals,

364
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,320
and taking loans to maintain its political power.

365
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,640
What do you expect from a country like this?

366
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,120
That's exactly why we're going to overthrow Yuan,

367
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,040
overthrow this corrupt government,

368
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,400
and build a new nation.

369
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,040
No!

370
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,880
Can China be saved by political revolution?

371
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,800
China's problems are ingrained habits that are hard to break.

372
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,440
Can we solve the problems simply by changing the leaders or governments?

373
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,400
So according to you,

374
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
our China has no way out?

375
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,040
There is a way, but the way out is not the old way.

376
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,920
Only when we find a new way out,

377
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
China will not perish.

378
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,880
What is the old way?

379
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,240
The succession of political regimes,

380
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,600
the replacing of an old dynasty

381
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
with a new dynasty.

382
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,160
The cycle repeats itself. This is the old way.

383
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,200
And what is the new way?

384
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,080
I don't know yet.

385
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,280
That's what I'm looking for.

386
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,200
Shouchang, I appreciate your insights and your talent.

387
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,280
Will you look for this new path with me?

388
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,480
To find a way to save China

389
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
is my life's work.

390
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,560
I will.

391
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,640
Good.

392
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,320
Zhongfu!

393
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
You've both come here

394
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,560
and made us look for you!

395
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,640
Tickets... we have the tickets.

396
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,800
Tomorrow we can go back home.

397
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,480
Excellent. Finally we can go back.

398
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,440
Zhongfu, before you head back,

399
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,120
you finally got to see Shouchang.

400
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
It's not in vain that you took

401
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,520
the crime of being a traitor.

402
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,108
Not in vain... not in vain...

403
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,040
See me?

404
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,800
Yeah.

405
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,200
He's here to see you today.

406
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,440
Ever since he read from the "The Tiger",

407
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,120
your article,

408
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,120
he's been wanting to see you.

409
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,160
Was it worth the trip?

410
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,280
The harvest is rich, like a heaven-sent gift!

411
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,520
You... you always stay indoors to write articles

412
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,400
not allowing us to care for you,

413
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,360
or ask questions,

414
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,040
making yourself like a beggar.

415
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,960
With you unkempt hair, dirty face, and body-full of lice,

416
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,440
[Yi Baisha, styled Yuecun, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

417
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
You'll definitely scare Junman when you get back home!

418
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,600
Hurry back!

419
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,440
Cut your hair, take a bath, and change your clothes.

420
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,800
I can take a bath,

421
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,560
but I only have one set of clothes. There's nothing else to change into.

422
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,520
Alright.

423
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,440
Brother Zhongfu. Wait.

424
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,000
It's going to be windy at sea. Take care of yourself.

425
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,320
Okay, then I'll accept your gift.

426
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,720
Shouchang, I owe you three favors today.

427
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,200
In the future, you must remember to ask my return of favors.

428
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,160
What are they?

429
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
One is to help me get out of trouble.

430
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,520
Second is to lend me clothes.

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,800
And the third?

432
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,320
I scrounged your meal.

433
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,880
But before I had enough to eat,

434
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,080
I got chased away.

435
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,680
Then keep scrounging!

436
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,280
Can I buy you all a meal?

437
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,320
None of us has eaten yet.

438
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,840
Then we'll all scrounge along.

439
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
Good, Brother Zhongfu, this way.

440
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,440
Zhongfu, what time is it already, you're still not going to bed?

441
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,640
What is worth seeing outside?

442
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,280
The ship just passed Shandong.

443
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,400
I feel apprehensive as I come near home.

444
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,360
The ship just passed Shandong.

445
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,040
There's anger in my heart. I want to scold someone.

446
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,840
I want to scold Yuan Shikai.

447
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,280
I also want to scold this Big Head Yuan (homophone for "squanderer").

448
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,400
I don't know what he's thinking,

449
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,800
he had the guts give away Qingdao to Japan.

450
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
What would you say, did this guy take the wrong medicine (meaning, lose his mind)?

451
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,480
Yuan Shikai did not take the wrong medicine.

452
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,560
It's our country

453
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,480
that is already incurable.

454
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,720
Why do you say that?

455
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,160
Think about it.

456
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,120
Since Lin Zexu banned opium in the Daoguang era,

457
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,280
it's been seventy-five years.

458
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,600
Throughout this entire time, how many people

459
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,800
thought of different ways

460
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,720
but still couldn't save the Great Qing dynasty.

461
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,480
Sun Yat-sen introduced the Republic from the West,

462
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,560
our compatriots all thought that this

463
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,080
was a remedy to save the country and enrich the people.

464
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,360
Who would have thought, the republic works in other countries,

465
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,520
but inside of China, it does not work anymore.

466
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,760
After three or four years of the Republic,

467
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,400
the country is somehow even worse than it used to be.

468
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,720
Since there is no cure,

469
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,560
then isn't it easier to take the old way.

470
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,280
This type of sentiments is not shared just by one or two people.

471
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,320
Baisha.

472
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,520
Isn't it the case?

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,840
You know what, that Liang Shiyi's gang is now

474
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,880
jumping up and down in tandem everywhere.

475
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Even Yang Hugong (Yang Du, politician), Yan Jidao (Yan Fu, military officer, newspaper editor, translator and writer, known for introducing western ideas to China)

476
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
also serving their tiger master to make a scene.

477
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,600
Preposterous.

478
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,680
Yang Du, Yan Fu.

479
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,960
They are the wisest who can have a momentary lapse in judgment.

480
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,760
Whereas that Liang Shiyi group

481
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,720
are political hooligans with no moral bottom line.

482
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,800
I made up a name for them

483
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
called Li Yilian.
(lit. propriety, righteousness, honesty)

484
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,160
Li Yilian, what does this mean?

485
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,480
Li Yilian -- lacking shame!
(lit. propriety, righteousness, honesty, and a sense of shame; upheld as the "four social bonds" in ancient China)

486
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,640
Extremely shameless! Most shameless of all!

487
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,840
Brilliant! What a good Li Yilian!

488
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,600
Zhongfu, your thinking is clearly extraordinary!

489
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,760
Baisha, I'm ashamed.

490
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,000
For more than ten years,

491
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,640
I, Chen Duxiu, first learned after Kang Liang (Kang Youwei & Liang Qichao),

492
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,320
followed by [Sun] Yat-sen,

493
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,240
committed to the political revolution,

494
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
rushing about, escaping death many times.

495
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,880
I have escaped to Japan alone for five times.

496
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,160
As a result, however,

497
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,920
nothing is achieved still, right?

498
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
In terms of the future of China,

499
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,520
political revolution alone

500
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,840
won't solve the fundamental problem.

501
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,440
To get to the bottom of this, we must change our way of thinking.

502
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,920
Do you have any new ideas?

503
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,440
I wouldn't dare to call them new ideas.

504
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,880
but on my return this time,

505
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,880
I've made up my mind.

506
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,080
For twenty years, I'm not going to touch upon politics.

507
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,720
If you're not going to touch upon politics, then what do you want to do?

508
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,040
Be reborn. Change the body, change the mind.

509
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,720
It's late now.

510
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,120
Hurry up and go to sleep.

511
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,960
Zhongfu, what time is it already?

512
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
What are you still sitting there for?

513
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,080
It's so dark out there,

514
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,960
you can't see anything at all.

515
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,040
Go to bed now. Turn off the lights, okay?

516
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,960
I do see.

517
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,480
Students of our generation,

518
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,975
[Waseda University dormitory]

519
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,240
especially among the people, should bear great responsibilities.

520
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,120
Those who research the spiritual realms (i.e., liberal arts and social science)

521
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,400
should produce beautiful literature

522
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,400
and noble thinking

523
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,360
to contribute to the spiritual development of our nation.

524
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,960
Those who research material realms (i.e., natural science)

525
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,400
should frequently express their profound thinking

526
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,640
and apply them exquisitely in real life

527
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,080
to seek the development of our country's military technology and instruments.

528
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,400
The power of spirit is omnipotent,

529
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,680
and if held with sincerity and perseverance,

530
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,480
one will lead a magnificent and meaningful endeavor.

531
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,640
Based on even the fainted glow of conscience,

532
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,040
Cao Mo will avenge shame
(cf. legend of Lu General Cao Mo forcing Duke Huan of Qi to return Lu's territory after three defeats)

533
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,960
and Goujian will take revenge,
(cf. King Goujian of Yue's conquering of Wu, after Goujian was captured and enslaved by the Wu king)

534
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,640
Times like those will eventually come.

535
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,840
Brother Fengzai, I say, you are really capable.

536
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,760
You have everything prepared here!

537
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,520
This mah-jong game, I love it the most!

538
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,560
I also love playing mah-jong!

539
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,480
Brother Fengzai, you are truly wise and brilliant.

540
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,360
You managed to get everyone tickets for a second class cabin.

541
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,200
If we were in the fourth class cabin,

542
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,240
next to the pauper,

543
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
It would have been so boring!

544
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,080
Right! So boring!

545
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,440
All of these are not worth mentioning.

546
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,200
My second uncle said

547
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
When Yuan Shikai becomes the emperor,

548
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,960
he will be the head of imperial palace affairs.

549
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
When you return home, help us with more publicity.

550
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,120
When the time comes, I will give you your due.

551
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,800
No problem!

West wind (mah-jong tile name).

553
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,640
I say, Brother Fengzai,

554
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,800
for the sake of Yuan Shikai,

555
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,640
we've already given up our opportunities go study abroad.

556
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,760
You have to tell your second uncle about it, right?

557
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,400
Let me guess,

558
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,720
you're all having the same doubts?

559
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,840
Of course!

560
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,080
Okay!

561
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,400
Then let me help you all clear these doubts.

562
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,320
My second uncle says,

563
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,800
as long as the work is done,

564
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,040
we can all go study at Peking University.

565
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,320
Are you serious?

566
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,320
Then we will have boundless prospects.

567
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,160
This is great! Peking University!

568
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,240
I was just waiting for this promise from you!

569
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,840
Zhongfu!

570
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,120
Somebody made way for you,

571
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,240
why didn't you acknowledge them?

572
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,320
This is unreasonable.

573
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,760
Who is this person?

574
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,160
He is a famous Chinese United League (Tongmenghui) veteran,

575
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,040
General Zou Yongcheng, commander of the Third Army of Hunan-Henan Coalition Forces.

576
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,400
You need to give him an apology.

577
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,360
I've always been uninterested in bureaucrats.

578
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,640

579
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,560
Greetings Mr. Yi Baisha.

[Zou Yongcheng, styled Qizhi, Chinese United League member]

581
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,280
Greetings General Zou.

582
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,080
Mr. Zhongfu.

583
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,360
General Zou isn't just any official.

584
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,360
In the second year or the Republic, when Song Jiaoren (political leader and a founder of KMT) was assassinated,

585
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,320
General Zou deeply felt that the Republic would fall apart.

586
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,760
He left a suicide poem,

587
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,000
jumped into the Huangpu River in anger to commit suicide.

588
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,000
"After more than ten years of vigorous revolution,

589
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,920
Hu Lu (initially referring to Xiongnu, later extended to general northern invading nomads such as the ruling Manchus of Qing) was expelled with their ancestral whip.

590
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,520
Only to find that the ape (homophone of Yuan) somersaulted out,

591
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,680
the Republic becomes a dream and I shall return to Heaven."

592
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,200
How noble and majestic!

593
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,440
Not really, I'm ashamed of the being an incompetent.

Jumping into Huangpu River to commit suicide.

595
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,440
Just an attempt?

596
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,440
Indeed, it was an attempt.

597
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,120
Luckily I was rescued by fishermen.

598
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,360
If so,

599
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,000
I actually think you are a fool.

600
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,320
How can a revolutionary kill himself so easily?

601
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,560
I, Chen Duxiu, in this life,

602
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,320
would never do anything stupid to kill myself and alienate myself from the revolution.

603
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,880
Zhongfu!

604
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,000
General Zou, I apologize.

605
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,280
It's alright.

606
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,142
Zhongfu!

607
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:10,825
Zhongfu!

608
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,840
You were too overbearing.

609
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
Being ruthless does not make you a true hero.

610
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Maybe one day,

611
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,440
I will also be like Qu Yuan (poet and politician during the Warring State period, known for his patriotism),

612
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,320
jumping into a river to commit suicide for my country.

613
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,080
At that time, will you also come ridicule me?

614
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,560
Sorry, Baisha.

615
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm not in a good mood, I forgot my manners.

616
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,720
Forgive me.

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,080
but recently came to Shanghai as well.

622
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,200
Poor woman, she is both an aunt and a stepmother,

She's sick with no money,

624
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,480
and has to take care of a family with five to six people.

625
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,000
I really don't know

626
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,960
how they would survive.

627
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,560
You... This way of managing the family is questionable.

628
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,680
I heard you insist on not covering

629
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,200
living expenses for the two brothers, Yannian and Qiaonian,

630
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,560

631
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,680
providing for themselves.

632
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,360
At such a young age,

633
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,880
who can take this kind of suffering?

634
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,560
Why can't they take this kind of suffering?

Let go! Let go!

721
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,720
Let go of me.

722
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,543
What's going on?

723
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:47,615
What's going on?

724
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,920
Let go of me!

725
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,640
You guys can't be like this!

726
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,480
Stop right now! What do you guys want to do!

727
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,320
Let go. Let go of me!

728
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,200
Get your hands off of me!

729
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,000
What are you guys doing!

730
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,640
You can't be like this!

731
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,200
Let go of me!

732
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,360
What are you doing

733
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,560
Let go of me!

734
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,000
They're hurting someone!

735
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,120
That's a girl!

736
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,880
What are you doing?

737
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,960
Let go! Let go!

738
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,640
Hands off! Take your hands off right now!

739
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,320
What the heck is going on down there?

740
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,520
A live performance of "Romance of the Western Chamber" on board!

741
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,480
Let me go!

742
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,840
Out of the way!

743
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,720
Stop fighting!

744
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,840
Who!

745
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,367
Who did it?

746
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:29,229
Who did it?

747
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,000
Who threw it?

748
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,400
What are you guys doing?

749
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,400
Do you want to steal money or jump into the sea and escape?

750
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,680
Our boat tickets were stolen!

751
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,120
That's why we came on the deck!

752
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,240
Don't strike!

753
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,800
Just forget it!

754
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,000
Let go!

755
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,640
Just forget it!

756
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,865
Stop fighting!

757
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:58,571
Stop fighting!

758
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,000
Great!

759
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,960
Stop the ruckus!

760
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,240
You are supposed to be quiet and courteous here.

761
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,520
We are on the ocean.

762
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,440
This boat belongs to Japan.

763
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,120
People who don't have a boat ticket must buy one.

764
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,680
So, everyone, please understand that

765
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,240
we conducted a secret investigation

766
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,800
and found out that those two originally did not have boat tickets.

767
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,920
Therefore

768
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,360
these two must buy boat tickets.

769
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,320
Let these two youths off.

770
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,240
As for the boat tickets, I'll pay for them.

771
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Okay, as long as the tickets are purchased.

772
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,600
It's not okay! You guys...

773
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,200
You have to apologize to the young Chinese couple.

774
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,240
This is our Japanese ocean liner,

775
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,520
we are carrying out official business.

776
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,840
There is no reason to apologize, you guys better not go too far.

777
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,680
Is beating people part of carrying out official business?

778
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,080
Is humiliating a woman part of carrying out official business?

779
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Is taking off a girl's clothes part of carrying out official business?

780
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm telling you guys...

781
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,280
you Japanese people are abusing your power,

782
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,800
willfully insulting us Chinese people.

783
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,320
This is an insult to our China!

784
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,840
This is the high seas!

785
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,560
This matter

786
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,720
is big enough to cause an international incident.

787
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,600
Are you trying to

788
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,280
cause enough troubles out of hand?

789
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,529
Apologize!

790
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,372
Apologize!

791
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,000
Apologize! Apologize!

792
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,628
Apologize!

793
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:19,829
Apologize!

794
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,275
Apologize! Apologize!

795
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,640
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Bad guys, apologize!

796
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,937
Apologize! Apologize!

797
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,640
Apologize! Apologize!

798
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,320
Apologize! Apologize!

799
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,880
Okay! I got it!

800
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,600
You two quickly apologize.

801
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,520
Sorry. Sorry.

802
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,800
Hey, let's go!

803
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,625
We won!

804
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,840
We won!

805
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
We won!

806
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,480
This is the victory? What did you win?

807
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,160
Just three words "I am sorry", and it's over?

808
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,200
That's right!

809
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,400
Does this count as victory?

810
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,920
Keep fighting!

811
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,280
Come back and keep fighting!

812
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,640
What are you saying!

813
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,760
Are you still human?

814
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,360
Seeing your fellow citizen being bullied...

815
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,240
not coming out to lend a hand...

816
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,520
instead, you are on the side making sarcastic remarks.

817
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,640
Are you still Chinese?

818
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,400
Do you still know what shame is?

819
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,880
You know what shame is,

820
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,960
what's the point of showing off here?

821
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,040
If you are so capable, go join the battle in Europe,

822
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,800
go exterminate the Eight-Nation Alliance.

823
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,440
That's right!

824
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,240
That's what is called capability.

825
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,800
You!

826
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,080
What do you want to do?

827
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,520
A Chinese person beating another Chinese?

828
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,720
Come.

829
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,720
Let all the foreigners see clearly...

830
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,960
how Chinese people bully each other.

831
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,840
Come.

832
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,640
Do you see it?

833
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,480
Chinese people are bullying each other!

834
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,760
Come!  Everyone, come and see!

835
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,800
Stop quarreling, all of you go back now!

836
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,400
Go away.

837
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,425
All of you go back.

838
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:43,177
Back to your cabin.

839
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,200
Don't be angry, don't lower yourself to their level.

840
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,560
Step aside.

841
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,520
Raise your foot a little.

842
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,720
You are stepping on my tile.

843
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,000
What tile?

844
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,840
Little... Little chick it seems like.

845
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,400
You eyesight seems pretty poor.

846
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,520
It's a cake.

847
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,360
Play often?

848
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,480
Why did you throw away the tile!

849
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,560
Fellow countrymen being insulted

850
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,640
is far less important

851
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,520
than your mah-jong game, right?

852
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,360
What the hell does this have to do with playing Mah-jong!

853
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,240
What did you throw away my tile for?

854
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,920
How can they be justified for sneaking on board without tickets?

855
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,240
The reason why our country is not prospering...

856
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,800
is that the people are not enlightened.

857
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,200
Do you have to go that far?!

858
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,880
Playing mah-jong...

859
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,560
has nothing to be with either he prosperity of the nation or the enlightenment of the people!

860
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,760
What did you throw away my tile for?

861
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,960
You guys still want to lose more face?

862
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,880
Us Chinese people arguing amongst ourselves here,

863
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,160
turning into laughing stocks to the foreigners.

864
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,800
Everybody, go back to your own cabin. Right now!

865
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,760
Let's go.

866
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Mr. Zhongfu, are you alright?

867
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm alright.

868
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,440
General Yongcheng,

869
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,440
Please accept my formal apology to you for 

870
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,120
my lack of manners from earlier.

871
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,680
You are a brave fellow!

872
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:05,646
That's too much of a compliment.

873
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,800
Thank you sirs!

874
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,280
Sir,

875
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,400
For the money for boat tickets

876
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,920
we will for sure repay you as soon as possible.

877
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,880
No need, no need.

878
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,320
We are all Chinese people

879
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,680
We're supposed to help each other.

880
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,640
Thank you!

881
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,320
Mr. Zhongfu.

882
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,480
You helped us, despite what happened yesterday.

883
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,160
I wholeheartedly am grateful to you.

884
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,760
What about the events of yesterday?

885
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,400
You forgot,

886
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
At Waseda,

887
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,760
I spit on you.

888
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,720
How about if I didn't forget?

889
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,840
Should I spit back at you?

890
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,600
You spit on me

891
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,120
out of your courage and uprightness.

892
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,320
Today we helped to defend you

893
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,360
out of our courage and uprightness.

894
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,960
But relying merely on courage and uprightness,

895
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,800
when will this fight ever end?

896
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,240
Do you understand the reasoning behind this?

897
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,160
I am all ears for our instructions.

898
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,200
Good.

899
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,400
Then let's go back to our cabin to chat.

900
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,320
General Yongcheng, please.

901
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Let's go.  Come on.

902
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,240
Qiaonian,

903
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,640
All set. Now I won't be afraid that it's gonna fall.

904
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:40,840
Here.

905
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,320
Brother Yannian, Brother Qiaonian!

906
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,320
What are you doing here?

907
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,280
What tasty food are you eating?

908
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,160
I also want to eat!

909
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:48,810
[Chen Zimei, daughter of Chen Duxiu]

910
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,160
Aunt!

911
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,040
Yannian, Qiaonian.

912
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,345
[Gao Junman, wife of Chen Duxiu]

913
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,240
So hard to eat!

914
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,680
What's wrong Zimei?

915
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Don't eat this anymore.

916
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,120
Aunt brought over some buns for you guys.

917
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,880
They just came out of the boiler.

918
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,560
Eat the buns.

919
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,080
Aunt, we won't eat these.

920
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,720
Aunt is not an stranger.

921
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,160
What is it that you can't eat these?

922
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,000
You can take them.

923
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,760
Thank you aunt!

924
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,960
I brought you guys some egg soup too.

925
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,640
Here.

926
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,760
Fresh out of the pot.

927
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,800
Thank you aunt!

928
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,520
Yannian. Come, eat some buns!

929
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,240
Aunt, we did buy these naans.

930
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
It's true that they don't look good. But they're actually quite tasty! 

931
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,680
Where's Henian?

932
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,680
He's not feeling very well.

933
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,200
I had a neighbor help look after him.

934
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,560
Yannian, Qiaonian,

935
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Aunt has come here many times to convince you guys.

936
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,600
But you are always stubbornly not willing to come home with me.

937
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,960
Now that our father is about to come back,

938
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,560
come home with me.

939
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,040
We won't go back.

940
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,800
We don't have anything to do with that person.

941
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,560
But you guys working outside like this...

942
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,800
is truly onerous!

943
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,560
You can't even get a bite of something warm.

944
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,600
Come home with me please.

945
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,120
You'd after all be able to have some warm food.

946
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,320
Is that okay?

947
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,200
Aunt, please don't try to persuade us anymore.

948
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,800
We will rely on ourselves.

949
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,320
This is our principle.

950
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,400
Zimei,

951
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,480
your brothers are going to go to work.

952
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,680
This time we can't play with you.

953
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,720
Next time, okay?

954
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,160
Let's go!

955
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,000
Goodbye, aunt.

956
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,240
Wait a minute!

957
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,720
Here.

958
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,560
Take all of these buns with you!

959
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,160
Older brother, you promised that you will get me some grasshoppers!

960
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,760
It's a deal! As your brother I will keep my promises for sure!
