[Episode One]

3
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,160
In 1915,

4
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,520
World War I

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,760
entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

6
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:51,080
While Germany was distracted in Europe,

7
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:54,120
Japan stepped up its expansion in China.

8
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:56,520
Before and after

9
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,600
the failure of the Second Revolution,

10
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:01,480
Sun Zhongshan and others were forced into exile overseas.

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,520
Bourgeois revolutionaries

12
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,000
were unable to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end.

13
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,440
With political chaos at home,

14
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:13,080
the suffering of the people,

15
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,040
and internal and external troubles,

16
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,760
China was once again thrown into a tumultuous situation.

17
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,400
Mr President,

18
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,880
Japanese Minister Hijiyoshi has sent an ultimatum

19
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:26,040
to be replied within 48 hours.

20
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:29,000
[Yuan Shikai, President of the Republic of China]
What does the ultimatum say?

21
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:30,720
[Liang Shiyi, styled Yifu, Premier of the Republic of China]
If we do not reply within the time limit,

22
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,640
[Liang Shiyi, styled Yifu, Premier of the Republic of China]
nor accept the Twenty-One Demands,

23
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:35,760
[Cao Rulin, styled Yuntian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China]
then Japan will take necessary measures.

24
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:37,680
What does he want?

25
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:38,880
Hijiyoshi said:

26
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:41,640
Japan is to take over Shandong in the northeast.

27
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:51,800
Japanese... They still want us dead.

28
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,920
This afternoon, the Ministry of War have reported

29
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:55,596
signs that the Japanese navy

30
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,640
is heading to our southeast coast.

31
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,840
What?

32
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,000
Does he want a war?

33
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:04,960
Make no mistake:

34
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,840
I am Yuan Shikai,

35
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,160
not Li Hongzhang.

36
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,120
For a long time, there have been discussions in Japan

37
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:12,360
advocating for Japanese intervention

38
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:15,200
in our country's Yangtze River basin as soon as possible.

39
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,080
Stupid... Stupid...

40
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,280
You didn't tell Hijikata that

41
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,350
it's not that I, Yuan Shikai, who disagreed with the Twenty-One demands.

42
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:27,680
It's the people who are rebelling so much.

43
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,800
It was them who hid Sun Zhongshan and Huang Xing in Japan.

44
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:33,520
Didn't they also say they should respect public opinion?

45
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,360
Our plea attempts have worked.

46
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:37,840
The Japanese agreed to our demands in Article 5,

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,040
which we can discuss later.

48
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:42,383
But... the treaty must be signed immediately.

49
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,960
What is your Foreign Ministry's response?

50
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,960
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs obeys the orders of the President.

51
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,160
Nicely said.

52
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,800
Then accept the Japanese terms.

53
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:11,800
Now Sun Zhongshan, Huang Xing and the others will make trouble again.

54
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,080
These people all kneel overseas.

55
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,160
It won't be a big deal.

56
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:16,600
Right.

57
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,680
Yuntian, tell the Japanese:

58
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,480
the treaty will be signed,

59
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:25,840
but Article 5 of the demands will not be accepted.

60
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:27,880
This is the bottom line.

61
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
I gave him respect,

62
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:31,960
he should also give me some.

63
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,560
Understood, Mr President.

64
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,360
What is the deadline for the Japanese?

65
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:37,520
Nine days.

66
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:39,640
Then wait until the night of the ninth day

67
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:41,360
to screw the Japanese.

68
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,960
Extra! Extra!

69
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,280
Today's extra is really strange!

70
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,320
President Yuan Shikai

71
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:50,560
is selling out the country!

72
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,760
This disgrace! Sells, sells, sells!

73
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:55,320
His back is not afraid to straighten up,

74
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,600
but the people of the country do not agree!

75
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,600
His anger is nowhere to be seen!

76
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:02,703
Look at this woman! So angry, she steps on the extra!

77
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:06,360
Look at this man! So angry, he breaks his crutch!

78
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,920
9th May, 1915

79
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:13,720
By order of Yuan Shikai,

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,120
an agreement is signed with Japan:

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,560
the Twenty-One Demands which humiliated the country.

82
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:18,880
According to this treaty,

83
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:21,000
China recognized Japan's inheritence of

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,480
all German rights and interests in Shandong.

85
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,200
Japan in southern Manchuria and eastern Mongolia in China

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,680
enjoyed special rights.

87
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:29,520
Japan gets in China

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,800
various railway construction rights, and so on.

89
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,520
The Beiyang government's sell-out

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,280
was strongly opposed by the nation.

91
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:38,440
All major cities in China,

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,960
like Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan,

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,120
Qingdao, and other places

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,880
all held huge demonstrations.

95
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:47,320
Shanghai dockers went on strike

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,640
announcing a boycott of Japanese goods.

97
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,120
Workers in Hankow, Zhenjiang, Hanyang, Changsha,

98
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,480
Fuzhou and other places

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
held various protests one after another.

100
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Refusing to recognise the Twenty-One Demands

101
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,600
and vowing to avenge national humiliation

102
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,400
demonstrates a strong anti-imperialist stance

103
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
and a strong patriotic passion.

104
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:07,754
Sun Zhongshan, Huang Xing and others in exile overseas

105
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:11,040
call for revolutionaries to return to China to oppose Yuan.

Let's take it easy, let's eat first.

When the country's at stake, there is no time to eat.

now that the country is in trouble and the republic is dying

148

you're all being a bit sly here.

149
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:09,840
Are you still Chinese?

150
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:11,880
Do you have any patriotism left in you?

151
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:13,760
That's right! Are you Chinese?!

152
00:09:13,868 --> 00:09:14,800
China is now in this state,

153
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,240
has been for much more than a day or two ago.

154
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,720
Can you save the country with this?

155
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:20,520
It's all because of you knuckleheads!

156
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,960
China is in such a sorry state!

157
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,400
Yeah! The prisoners are you!

158

Prisoners? Us?

159
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:32,320
We won't go along with this accusation.

160

If it weren't for those stupid revolutionaries.

161
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,440
Had they not wanted to copy the American republican system,

162
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:41,080
China would have been a constitutional monarchy.

163
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,560
It wouldn't have turned out to be

164
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,240
the grotesque situation we find ourselves in today.

165
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,920
Yuan Shikai's attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy

166
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,080
was a real return to the right track.

167
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:51,600
This is the way to save China.

168
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:52,760
The foundation of prosperity.

169
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:53,960
Nonsense!

170
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,960
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!

171
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:57,320
The idea of a democratic republic

172
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:58,920
is already well established.

173
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,600
Aren't you driving backwards in history?

174
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:03,756
Yeah! That's right! Driving backwards!

175
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,760
We are the ones driving backwards in history?

176
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:08,600
Or is it you revolutionaries?

177
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,880
Ignoring China's national conditions!

178
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,320
Students! Countrymen!

179
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,520
Kang Youwei has long said:

180
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,760
a revolution is not a good thing for a country.

181
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,440
The French Revolution:

182
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,000
eighty years of turmoil and bloodshed of millions.

183
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,360
Furthermore, the Chinese people are not yet open-minded.

184
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:26,880
In this case,

185
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:28,760
the forced imposition of a republican system

186
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,400
will be like a floating duck on water, with no roots.

187
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:34,360
Zhang Fengzai, what you just said

188
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,040
is absolutely absurd!

189
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:38,000
The words of Kang Youwei

190
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:40,600
have been refuted by many revolutionary martyrs.

191
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:42,520
Of course the revolution will shed blood.

192
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,400
But I would like to ask you:

193
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:48,040
if a monarch is established first, will there be no bloodshed?

194
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:48,800
Right!

195
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,442
[Zhang Tuzhao, styled Xing Yan, prominent social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

196
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,000
[Zhang Tuzhao, styled Xing Yan, prominent social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Yeah! That's right!

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,520
[Zhang Tuzhao, styled Xing Yan, prominent social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy.

198
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:55,440
Which country has not experienced this?

199
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,760
How many times has this happened?

200
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,360
The sacrifices that have been made

201
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:01,400
to achieve real social progress.

202
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:03,200
Another thing I want to ask you is,

203
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:05,000
what did you just say?

204
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:09,040
Our country is not yet open-minded?

205
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,040
That's demonstrably false!

206
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,160
Since the Xinhai Revolution,

207
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,960
the mindset of the entire population

208
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:18,154
has changed dramatically.

209
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:21,120
Judging from the unanimous rejection of Yuan at home and abroad,

210
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,640
this is hard evidence.

211
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,960
The more the nation is at stake,

212
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:28,000
the more the people should become aware of the situation.

213
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:29,880
To revive the national spirit

214
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,480
and if the idea of republicanism is to be put into practice

215
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:33,560
for the people,

216
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:36,600
it is necessary to overthrow the feudal ideology

217
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:39,880
Zhang Fengzai, those who go against the tide of history

218
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,720
will be drowned by the torrent of the times.

219
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,280
For the love of our country,

220
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,200
we want to save our country. Down with Yuan.

221
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:50,000
For the sake of our Chinese nation,

222
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:53,455
we must save our country. Down with Yuan!

223
00:11:53,821 --> 00:12:01,920
Save the country! Down with Yuan!

224
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:02,880
Well said!

225
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:04,720
Well said!

226
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
Professor Xing Yan.

227
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:09,360
Hello students.

228
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:10,920
The usual words:

229
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,800
well-reasoned, from the heart,

230
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:16,760
passionate, engaging.

231
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,960
Very good.

232
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:21,040
Zhong Fu, what do you think?

233
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:23,040
Zhong Fu? Chen Duxiu?

234
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:25,200
It's Chen Duxiu!

235
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,400
Chen Duxiu!

236
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,720
Is it Chen Duxiu?

237
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,200
Why does he look like that?

238
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,400
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhong Fu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

239
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,720
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhong Fu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Could it be Chen Duxiu?

240
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,200
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhong Fu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
It can't be.

241
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:37,000
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhong Fu, revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
As you said,

242
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:39,080
a very knowledgeable young man.

243
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,120
Chen Duxiu.

244
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:42,840
Why are you eating here?

245
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,920
I was just passing by

246
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:45,600
seeing them bickering.

247
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:46,520
No one was eating.

248
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,080
One should never waste food at any time.

249
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,720
It's shameful to waste food

250
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:54,120
What time is it? You're still eating here?

251
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,040
Are you Chen Duxiu?

252
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:01,600
I am, yes.

253
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:02,320
He really is!

254
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,400
I am Chen Duxiu.

255
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:06,320
He is! He's Chen Duxiu!

256
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:07,480
Quiet, everyone!

257
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:09,240
Quiet!

258
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:11,920
Since Mr. Zhong Fu is here,

259
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:13,400
we would like to ask you:

260
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,280
what do you think should be done to save China?

261
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:17,800
I think that

262
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,880
such a country is irredeemable.

263
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,880
What did you say?

264
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,400
Are you Chinese? How can you say that?

265
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:27,960
Chen Duxiu, are you talking about people?

266
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:29,600
Simply shameless!

267
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:31,560
Shameless!

268
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:32,840
What are you doing?

269
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,560
You've gone too far!

270
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:37,800
Mr. Zhong Fu, what you just said,

271
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,560
do you really believe that?

272
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,320
Yes, of course.

273
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,080
But yeah, I meant to say...

274
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
You see?!

275
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,880
Students! You have seen it!

276
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,080
This is what you call a revolutionary party!

277
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:50,880
Behold, the great revolutionary!

278
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:52,720
Do you know what he said?

279
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:55,120
He said he was sorry for his country's subjugation.

280
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,120
What else?

281
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:59,360
What is the horror of being a slave to a fallen nation?

282
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,864
A country of a brutalized people, where is the love for it?

283
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,760
This is the real traitor, a hanjian!

284
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,120
Traitor! Hanjian!

285
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
Hanjian!

286
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,440
Get out of the way!

287
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,200
Don't do it!

288
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:16,560
Let's have a good chat!

289
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:17,440
Don't do it!

290
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,160
Stop!

291
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Don't do it!

292
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,720
Don't do it!

293
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,000
Mr Zhong Fu, go!

294
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't do it!

295
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:27,400
Let's have a good chat! Don't do it!

296
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:29,360
Come on, this way!

297
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,400
Don't do it, people, don't do it!

298
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,280
Listen to me for a moment!

299
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,240
Mr. Xing Yan has a message for everyone!

300
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,720
Mr. Xing Yan has a message for everyone!

301
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,200
Come on, everyone, let me tell you something!

302
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
Come on, come on!

303
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,120
Alright.

304
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,120
Alright, alright, no one is following.

305
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:56,640
Take a break, take a break.

306
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:21,120
Not like Chen Duxiu, right?

307
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,520
I just imagined

308
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,760
something a little different.

309
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:29,120
So what do you imagine it should be like?

310
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:30,800
Are you okay?

311
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:34,560
I apologise for the situation.

312
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,981
It's okay, I've seen a lot of these.

313
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:41,702
Your article

314
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:44,520
"Patriotism and Self-consciousness", I've read it.

315
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:47,040
But there are many doubts and unanswered questions.

316
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:49,120
I would like to ask you some, is that okay?

317
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,960
I know that you, Li Dazhao, are from Hebei.

318
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:55,345
Yanzhao is a land of compassion and tragedy, I must confess.

319
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,800
But now in China

320
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,640
there is a shortage of real men who believe in the truth.

321
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,960
Ask.

322
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,840
You said that patriotism should have a stand

323
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,560
and not be willing to be Yuan Shikai's obedient people

324
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,400
in the name of patriotism.

325
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,080
According to you,

326
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:10,760
as long as Yuan Shikai is in power,

327
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,040
people should not be patriotic.

328
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,160
You misunderstood the reasoning behind it.

329
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,000
I meant to say,

330
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,200
patriotism should have a position.

331
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,240
You can't link patriotism with loyalty to Yuan Shikai.

332
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:24,320
You can't confuse

333
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,840
patriotism with loyalty to Yuan Shikai

334
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,640
to cover up Yuan Shikai's theft of the country.

335
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,280
This is similar to what you just said,

336
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,440
is it not?

337
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:32,880
This Yuan Shikai

338
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:35,720
claims that he represents the country.

339
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,840
He is confusing the idea.

340
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,000
If patriotism has no position,

341
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,240
then we simply have no reason

342
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,000
to defeat Yuan Shikai.

343
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:46,480
I agree.

344
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:48,480
I think the first priority today is

345
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:51,160
to inspire the people to be truly patriotic.

346
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:54,320
Right now China is being divided up by the Western powers.

347
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:55,840
If we are not patriotic,

348
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
then the country will die.

349
00:16:57,915 --> 00:16:59,960
Shou Chang, I ask you:

350
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,229
What did the Western powers rely on to carve up China?

351
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:04,320
Gunboats.

352
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:04,960
No.

353
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:07,454
You are talking about the Opium War and the Sino-Japanese War.

354
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:11,235
Now the powers are dividing China by borrowing money.

355
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:13,170
The Chinese government

356
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:16,550
borrows foreign debt from Western countries every year.

357
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,808
More than half of the treasury's revenue,

358
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,087
in a country without productivity.

359
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,510
The state can only be maintained

360
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,390
by borrowing against the national tax railroad.

361
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:29,782
What do you expect from a country like this?

362
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:32,270
That's why we're going to overthrow Yuan,

363
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,192
overthrow this corrupt government,

364
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:35,544
and build a new nation.

365
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:36,080
No!

366
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,027
China can be saved by political revolution.

367
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,920
China's problems are accumulating.

368
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:44,469
Can we solve the problem by changing people and governments?

369
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:47,509
So, according to you,

370
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,262
China has no way out?

371
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,184
Yes, but the way out is not the old way.

372
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,032
The way out is a new way.

373
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:56,845
China will not die.

374
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:57,950
What is the old way?

375
00:17:58,425 --> 00:17:59,383
The dynastic cycle:

376
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:00,640
the overthrow of an old dynasty,

377
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,643
the establishment of a new dynasty.

378
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,246
The cycle repeats itself. It's the old way.

379
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,388
And what is the new way?

380
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,193
Don't know.

381
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,382
That's what I'm looking for.

382
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,262
Shou Chang, I appreciate your knowledge and talent.

383
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,317
Will you look for this new path with me?

384
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,520
To find a way to save China

385
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:24,062
is my life's work.

386
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:25,719
I will.

387
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:27,716
Good.

388
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,474
Zhong Fu!

389
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,915
You've both come here

390
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:39,707
and made us look for you!

391
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:41,746
Tickets... we have the tickets.

392
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:43,889
Tomorrow we can go back home.

393
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:47,631
Excellent. Finally we can go back.

394
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:50,481
Zhong Fu, before I go back,

395
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,189
I finally got to see Shou Chang.

396
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,913
It's not in vain that you have been charged

397
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,626
with being a traitor to the country.

398
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,187
Not in vain... not in vain...

399
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,199
See me?

400
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:01,902
Yeah.

401
00:19:02,469 --> 00:19:04,266
He's here to see you today.

402
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:06,601
Ever since he was on the "Kaiyin",

403
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,170
and read your article,

404
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,229
he's been wanting to see you.

405
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:11,305
It was worth the trip.

406
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:14,399
A great harvest, a great treasure.

407
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:18,582
You... You are always bored in the room writing articles

408
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:19,555
not letting us control

409
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:20,425
nor letting us ask,

410
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,186
making yourself like a beggar.

411
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:23,039
I've got lice all over my body.

412
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,978
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Chuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
I've got lice all over my body.

413
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:24,380
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Chuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

414
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,655
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Chuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
You'll scare Junman back home!

415
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:25,803
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Chuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

416
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:26,621
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Chuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Hurry back!

417
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:26,861
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Chuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

418
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,417
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Chuan, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]
Cut your hair, take a bath and change your clothes.

419
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:28,548
Cut your hair, take a bath and change your clothes.

420
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:29,843
There's a bath

421
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,710
and there is only one change of clothes.

422
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:32,654
Alright.

423
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,539
Zhong Fu, wait!

424
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,107
It's windy at sea. Take care of yourself.

425
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,334
Okay, I'll be glad to do so.

426
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:53,832
Shou Chang, I owe you three favours today.

427
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,339
In the future, you must remember to ask for it.

428
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,320
What are they?

429
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:59,135
One is to help me get out of trouble.

430
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,591
Second is to lend me clothes.

431
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:01,896
And the third?

432
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:03,495
I ate your food.

433
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:07,980
But I had enough to eat before

434
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,175
before it knocked me off my feet.

435
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:10,820
So keep rubbing it in.

436
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,370
Can I buy you all dinner?

437
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,415
We haven't even eaten yet.

438
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:14,904
Then we'll follow the trail.

439
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:16,334
Good, Brother Zhong Fu, this way.

440
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,486
Zhong Fu, what time is it already, you're still not going to sleep?

441
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,743
What is there worth seeing outside?

442
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,271
The boat passed Shandong.

443
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,543
I feel apprehensive as I near home.

444
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,429
The boat passed Shandong.

445
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,957
There's anger in my heart. I want to scold someone.

446
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:00,971
I want to scold Yuan Shikai.

447
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,371
I also want to scold this Yuan Datou.

448
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,371
I don't know what he's thinking,

449
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,800
he dared to give Qingdao to Japan.

450
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:14,529
You say, did this guy take the wrong medicine?

451
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,457
Yuan Shikai did not take the wrong medicine.

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
It's our country

453
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,586
that is already incurable.

454
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:25,843
Why do you say that?

455
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Think about it.

456
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:29,943
From guangnian, when Lin Zexu forbid opium.

457
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:32,471
It's been a whole 75 years already.

458
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:34,518
In the middle of this, how many people

459
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:35,900
thought of different ways

460
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,236
but still couldn't save the Great Qing Dynasty

461
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:41,400
Sun Zhongshan introduced the republic from the West,

462
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:43,557
people of the country all thought that this

463
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,171
was a remedy to save the country and enrich the people.

464
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:48,343
Who would have thought, the republic works in other countries

465
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,514
but inside of China it does not work anymore.

466
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:52,700
Three to four years of the republic later,

467
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:55,414
the country is not as good as it used to be.

468
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,771
Since there is no cure,

469
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,614
then isn't taking the old way better.

470
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,257
These aren't just the thoughts of one or two people.

471
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:03,357
Bai Sha

472
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,529
Isn't it?

473
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:08,900
Right now Liang Shiyi and his group

474
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:11,971
are establishing connections everywhere, moving up and down,

475
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:15,400
joining Yang Hugong, Yan Jidao

476
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,829
and helping a villain blindly create disturbances.

477
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,686
Unreasonable.

478
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,729
Yang Du, Yan Fu

479
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:28,043
(idiom) they are the wisest who can have a momentary lapse in judgement,

480
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:30,843
whereas that Liang Shiyi group

481
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,771
are political hooligans with no moral bottom line.

482
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,829
I made up a name for them

483
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,171
called "courtesy"

484
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,100
Li Yi Lian, what does it mean?

485
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,529
Courtesy: shameless

486
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,714
Extremely shameless! Especially shameless!

487
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,857
Good! What a good courtesy!

488
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:58,543
Zhong Fu, your thinking is clearly unusual!

489
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,757
Bai Sha, I'm ashamed.

490
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:07,114
It's been more than ten years.

491
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:09,714
Chen Duxiu first learned Kang Liang,

492
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:11,357
followed by Zhong Shan,

493
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,300
committed to the political revolution,

501

The study of spiritual knowledge

520
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:25,643
should always produce a beautiful literature,

Those who study the material sciences

524

For what reason...

661
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:40,149
Because I'm in charge here!

662
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,657
Hey! How come it's you again?

663
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:44,114
Did you want to take the whipping for him?

664
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,914
Get out of here for me!

665
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,871
His leg already had an injury

666
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,943
What's wrong if the things fell on the ground?

667
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,114
Isn't it fine if it's picked up

668
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:49,714
What the fuck does his injury have to do with me!

669
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,029
You have to take responsibility for delaying business!

670
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,243
But you still can't beat someone up!

671
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,880
I just did. So what?

672
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,411
Believe it or not I'll beat both of you together

673
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:01,529
Don't hit!

674
00:31:01,686 --> 00:31:02,400
You can't fight!

675
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:03,143
Want to rebel, is that right?

676
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,229
Want to rebel, is that right!

677
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,414
You are quite a righteous brat, huh?

678
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,063
Fine, today I'll let you handle this first issue

679
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:10,857
Old Jia's life, you take care of

680
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:12,103
All of you can't get involved

681
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,349
Whoever comes out will do it themselves

682
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:13,989
Come

683
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:15,394
I'll do it

684
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:15,954
Me too

685
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,686
Count me in!

686
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:19,646
Since you two volunteered, you two do it

687
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:20,643
Come

688
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:21,929
No more nonsense!

689
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,914
Come

690
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:27,051
Who's next? Break it up!

691
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,560
What are you still looking at? Scatter

692
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,171
Turn over these two

693
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,286
It's nothing, all of you go back to work

694
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:30,829
Grab here

695
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:35,234
Okay

696
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:41,086
Here!

697
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:42,583
Lift

698
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:46,257
Lift

699
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:51,200
All right all right. Go do your job

700
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:52,571
What are you being distracted for!

701
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:53,886
Pick up those beans cleanly for me

702
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:55,349
If you miss even one grain, I'll kill you

703
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:56,720
Quickly

704
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:57,686
Hurry up

705
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:01,742
Older brother

706
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:03,129
I can't hold on anymore

707
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,471
Hurry and put it down! Don't injure your waist

708
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:06,571
That's not it, my waistband broke

709
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:11,977
Well then..

710
00:32:12,543 --> 00:32:13,406
Put your legs together

711
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:17,129
Don't move, alright

712
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,646
What are you messing around for? Quickly!

713
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,014
Take your legs out

714
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:27,086
Put on your shoes

715
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:29,394
You don't even want your shoes on now, huh?

716
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,766
Let go! Let go!

717
00:32:44,966 --> 00:32:45,600
Let go of me

718
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,400
What's going on!

719
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:47,615
What are you doing?

720
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:48,811
Let go of me!

721
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:49,669
You guys can't be like this!

722
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,417
Stop right now! What do you guys want to do!

723
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,166
Let go. Let go of me

724
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:54,257
Get your hands off of me!

725
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:54,960
What are you guys doing!

726
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,657
You can't be like this!

727
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:56,263
Let go of me!

728
00:32:57,829 --> 00:32:58,357
What are you doing

729
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,679
Let go of me!

730
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,000
They're hurting someone!

731
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,143
That's a girl!

732
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:04,028
What are you doing

733
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:05,931
Let go! Let go!

734
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,611
Hands off! Take your hands off right now

735
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:13,357
What the heck is going on down there?

736
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,636
Throw them overboard at portside!

737
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:15,514
Let me go!

738
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:22,857
Out of the way

739
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:23,726
Stop fighting

740
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:26,834
Who!

741
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:28,171
Who did it?

742
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:29,229
Who did it?

743
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:30,994
Who threw it?

744
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,406
What are you guys doing?

745
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:35,360
Do you want to steal money or jump into the sea and run away?

746
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,588
Our boat tickets were stolen

747
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,149
We just arrived on deck

748
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:39,157
Don't hit

749
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:39,874
Just forget it

750
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:40,880
Let go

751
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,600
Just forget it

752
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:51,669
Stop fighting

753
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:58,571
Stop fighting

754
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:11,040
Good!

755
00:34:11,086 --> 00:34:12,014
Stop the ruckus

756
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:13,132
It's forbidden to make a ruckus here

757
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:14,492
We are on the ocean

758
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:16,286
This boat belongs to Japan

759
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:22,149
People who don't have a boat ticket must buy one

760
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:24,686
So, everyone don't misunderstand

761
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:27,214
We conducted an investigation in secret

762
00:34:27,229 --> 00:34:31,589
and found out that those two originally did not have boat tickets

763
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:32,777
therefore

764
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:36,446
these two must buy boat tickets

765
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:39,189
Let these two youths off

766
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,063
The boat tickets, I'll pay for

767
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,529
Okay as long as the tickets are purchased, it's fine

768
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:46,583
It's not okay! You guys...

769
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,206
You have to apologize to these two Chinese youngsters

770
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:49,329
This is our Japanese ocean liner

771
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,537
we are carrying out official business

772
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:52,443
There is no reason to apologize, you guys better not go too far

773
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:54,594
Is beating people carrying out official business?

774
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:56,892
Is humiliating a woman carrying out official business?

775
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,914
Is taking off a girl's clothes carrying out official business?

776
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:00,069
I'm telling you guys...

777
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:02,251
you Japanese people are abusing your power

778
00:35:02,252 --> 00:35:03,783
wantonly insulting us Chinese people

779
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:05,292
This is an insult to our China

780
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:06,674
This is international waters

781
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:07,634
This is

782
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:09,623
a big matter that is enough to cause an international incident

783
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:10,594
Will you stop

784
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:12,257
messing around before this matter gets out of hand?

785
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:14,366
Apologize!

786
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,372
Apologize!

787
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,029
Apologize! Apologize!

788
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:18,606
Apologize!

789
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:19,829
Apologize!

790
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:23,166
Apologize!  Apologize!

791
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:27,246
Apologize!  Apologize!  Apologize!  Bad guys, apologize!

792
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,937
Apologize!   Apologize!

793
00:35:28,938 --> 00:35:30,034
Apologize!   Apologize!

794
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:31,931
Apologize!   Apologize!

795
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:35,931
Okay! I got it

796
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,640
You two quickly apologize

797
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,114
Sorry   Sorry

798
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:45,760
Hey Let's go

799
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:48,514
We won!

800
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,840
We won!

801
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
We won!

802
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:55,474
This is the victory?  What was the victory?

803
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,311
The three words "I am sorry", and it's over?

804
00:35:57,309 --> 00:35:58,183
That's right!

805
00:35:58,184 --> 00:35:59,200
Does this count as victory?

806
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:00,926
Keep fighting!

807
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:02,300
Come back and keep fighting

808
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:03,623
What are you saying!

809
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:04,754
Are you still human?

810
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:06,251
Seeing your fellow citizen being bullied...

811
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:07,189
not coming out to lend a hand...

812
00:36:07,257 --> 00:36:08,492
instead, you are on the side making sarcastic remarks

813
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:09,700
Are you still Chinese?

814
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:11,494
Do still know what shame is?

815
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:15,840
You know what shame is,

816
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:17,863
what's the point of showing off here?

817
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:20,023
If you have the ability fight a battle in Europe,

818
00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:21,646
you would exterminate the Eight-Nation Alliance.

819
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:22,354
That's right!

820
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:23,177
That's what is called ability

821
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:23,646
You!

822
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:25,051
What do you want to do?

823
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:26,514
A Chinese people fighting each other

824
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:27,692
Come

825
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:29,749
Let foreigners properly see...

826
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:31,806
how Chinese people bully each other

827
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:32,869
Come

828
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:35,714
Do you see it?

829
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:37,383
Chinese people are bullying each other!

830
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,800
Come  Everyone come see

831
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:39,840
Stop quarrelling, all of you go back for me

832
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:41,417
Let's go

833
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:42,263
All of you go back

834
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:43,177
All of you go back

835
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,126
Don't be angry, don't lower yourself to their level

836
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:51,554
Make way

837
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:54,503
Raise your feet a little

838
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:55,528
You stepped on my tile

839
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:00,960
What tile?

840
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:04,869
Little... Little chick it seems like

841
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:13,280
This eyesight of yours is not good

842
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:16,514
It's a cake

843
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,366
Play often?

844
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:21,714
Why did you throw the tile!

845
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:23,623
Fellow citizens being insulted 

846
00:37:24,614 --> 00:37:25,303
is far less important

847
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:28,526
than your mahjong game, is it?

848
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,314
What does this hell does have to do with playing Mahjong!

849
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:31,086
What did you throw my tile for?

850
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:32,617
How can they be justified in taking tickets?

851
00:37:33,743 --> 00:37:35,166
The reason why the country is not prospering...

852
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:37,783
is that the people's wisdom is not yet open.

853
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:40,114
Meaning?!

854
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:41,669
Playing mahjong...

855
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:43,532
What does it matter whether the people are open or not?

856
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:44,640
What did you throw my tiles for?

857
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,897
You guys still want to lose face?

858
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,714
Us Chinese people arguing amongst ourselves here...

859
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:48,983
We let the foreigners see a joke

860
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,692
Everyone else, go back to your cabin. Right now

861
00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:52,629
Let's go

862
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:56,274
Mr. Zhong Fu, are you alright? 

863
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:57,486
I'm alright

864
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:58,423
General Yongcheng

865
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:00,411
My discourteousness from before

866
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,989
I formally apologize to you

867
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:04,640
You are a fellow 

868
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:05,646
I'm ashamed

869
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:07,794
Thank you sirs

870
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:10,229
Sir,

871
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:11,440
The boat ticket money...

872
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:12,914
We will for sure return it to you as soon as possible

873
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:13,897
No need no need

874
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:15,257
We are all Chinese people

875
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:16,386
Helping each other is what we should do

876
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:17,669
Thank you

877
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:19,280
Mr. Zhong Fu

878
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,406
Your help, despite what happened yesterday,

879
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,040
I wholeheartedly thank you

880
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:24,731
What about the events of yesterday?

881
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:27,383
You forgot

882
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:28,994
At Waseda,

883
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:30,720
I spit a mouthful on you

884
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:33,714
How about if I didn't forget

885
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:34,823
spitting back at you

886
00:38:35,543 --> 00:38:36,526
You spit a mouthful of phlegm on me

887
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,314
it's your bravery

888
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,246
Today's fight...

889
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:40,297
is our bravery

890
00:38:40,497 --> 00:38:41,966
But it's only by bravery

891
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,714
This fight is going to last until when?

892
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:47,321
The principles in this, do you understand?

893
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:49,108
I will wholeheartedly listen to your instructions 

894
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:50,114
Good

895
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:53,440
Then let's go inside the cabins to chat

896
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:55,337
General Yongcheng, please

897
00:38:55,537 --> 00:38:56,434
Let's go.   Come.

898
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:07,280
Qiaonian

899
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:19,566
Good  Now I won't be afraid of it falling 

900
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:40,754
Here 

901
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,280
Brother Yannian Brother Qiaonian

902
00:40:44,214 --> 00:40:45,246
What are you doing here?

903
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:46,000
What good food are you eating 

904
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,132
I also want to eat

905
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,109
Aunt

906
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:55,977
Yannian Qiaonian

907
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,345
[Gao Junman, wife of Chen Duxiu]

908
00:40:58,286 --> 00:40:59,074
So hard to eat

909
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:00,492
What's wrong Zimei

910
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,354
Don't eat this anymore

911
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:06,069
Aunt brought over some buns for you guys

912
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:09,600
It just came out of the boiler

913
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:11,269
Eat the buns

914
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:14,823
Aunt, we won't eat it

915
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:17,948
Aunt is not an foreigner

916
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,200
What is it that you can't eat

917
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:24,960
You eat it

918
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:26,811
Thank you aunt

919
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:31,931
I brought you guys egg soup 

920
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,532
Here

921
00:41:43,886 --> 00:41:44,674
Fresh out of the pot

922
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:45,737
Thank you aunt

923
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,308
Yannian. Come, eat some buns

924
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,994
Aunt, money is used to buy this

925
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,851
When you look at it, it doesn't look good. Once you eat it, it's quite flavorful

926
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:00,629
Where's Henian

927
00:42:01,743 --> 00:42:02,629
He's not feeling very well

928
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:04,194
I had a neighbour help look after him

929
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,303
Yannian Qiaonian

930
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:09,714
Aunt has come here many times to urge you guys...

931
00:42:10,714 --> 00:42:12,560
You guys are always stubbornly not willing to come home with me

932
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:13,920
Your father is about to come back

933
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:15,463
Come home with aunt

934
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:18,069
We won't go back

935
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:19,646
We don't have anything to do with this person

936
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:23,680
But you guys working outside like this...

937
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,749
is truly a lot of hardship

938
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,394
Can't even get hot food to eat

939
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:28,572
Come home with me

940
00:42:28,643 --> 00:42:30,057
Good or bad, you can eat something hot

941
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,055
Okay?

942
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:34,079
Aunt, don't try to persuade us anymore

943
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:35,611
We will rely on ourselves

944
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:37,314
This is our principle

945
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:39,383
Zimei

946
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:41,360
Your brothers are going to go to work

947
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:42,389
This time we can't accompany you to play

948
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:43,634
Next time, okay

949
00:42:46,557 --> 00:42:47,017
Let's go

950
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:48,834
Goodbye aunt

951
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:52,937
Wait a minute

952
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:53,772
Here

953
00:42:54,857 --> 00:42:55,531
Take these all of these buns

954
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:57,166
Older brother, you agreed that I would send you my grasshopper

955
00:42:57,529 --> 00:42:58,697
Brother promised you, I will do it for sure
