1
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:02,960
In 1915,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,079
World War I entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

3
00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:10,118
Yuan Shikai's vain attempt to restore the monarchy

4
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:12,577
also gradually resurfaced.

5
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:18,760
Domestic and foreign troubles have once again thrown China into turmoil.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,200
Kneel!

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,800
Twice in three years!

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,160
Zhongfu, get rid of your illusions and be ready to fight.

9
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,120
We need to complete a great change that has not been seen in three thousand years,

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,840
defeat a powerful enemy that has not been met in three thousand years.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,720
Each generation has their duty.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,320
I'd like to invite you to Peking University as a liberal arts student,

13
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,360
and give the university a helping hand.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
With the efforts of all our colleagues,

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,280
our "New Youth" magazine has already accomplished in becoming

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,480
the most influential publication in China.

17
00:00:58,952 --> 00:00:59,720
We should use new ideas,

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,880
new culture,

19
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:01,920
new ethics,

20
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:03,600
to arm the minds of our members,

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,680
improve their conduct,

22
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,600
advance their knowledge.

23
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:10,918
This is also the first and only mission of our Xinmin Society.

24
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,600
Call on the masses of patriotic youth to consciously

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,680
transform their thinking.

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,400
Combine social transformation

27
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:19,080
with the fundamental transformation of Chinese society.

28
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:20,880
We advocate new culture:

29
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,280
this is to seek liberation in all aspects.

30
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:25,200
Our golden world,

31
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:27,240
our splendid world,

32
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,840
is right in front of us!

33
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:30,840
Use your journalist status

34
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,520
to get some people to write articles

35
00:01:32,997 --> 00:01:35,400
directly aimed at Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei.

36
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:37,600
Make a big deal out of it. Make him look bad.

37
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:39,800
Chen Duxiu! Hypocrite!

38
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:43,131
Chen Duxiu! You don't deserve to be a teacher!

39
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:46,280
Chen Duxiu! Hypocrite!

40
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,920
If we don't fight back,

41
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:52,057
the torch of new culture will be put out.

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,520
I will write another novel.

43
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,920
I will compete with Lin Qinnan!

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,860
This debate over culture is just and dignified.

45
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:02,836
This is not natural!

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,091
How could you think of that?

47
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:08,480
I know you won't do anything to harm the people.

48
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:11,360
We can't let people poke us in the back, can we?

49
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,760
I don't think people can live for themselves.

50
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:15,840
Go to Changxin

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,280
and take a look at the ruined shanties.

52
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,000
Go to Jinpu and take a look at them:

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
refugees with thousands of hungry people.

54
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:23,240
Go to Qianmen Street

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,080
and go see the the beggars begging along the street.

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,160
Shouldn't we do something for them?

57
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,400
Are you asking us to be like you?

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,680
Clean and shiny?

59
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,360
Two proposals from your delegation,

60
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,080
none of them are in the authority of the peace conference.

61
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:36,440
The Shandong Peninsula

62
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,080
is not in the interests of China and Germany

63
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,840
but in the interets of Japan and Germany.

64
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:41,960
Didn't we win?

65
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,440
Germany was defeated!

66
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,720
Qingdao should be returned!

67
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:47,320
In defeat, one bides their time.

68
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,720
We shouldn't have to put up with powers anymore!

69
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,520
Weak countries get pushed around. This is the law of the world.

70
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:54,640
China is our Chinese people's China.

71
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,320
If we do not love our country,

72
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,640
who will love it?

73
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,600
Yeah!

74
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:01,960
The country is at its tipping point in time.

75
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:03,240
We have to fight hard.

76
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:04,960
"Life and death for the country.

77
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:07,600
Is it because of fortune or misfortune?"

78
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:08,800
Do you think

79
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,080
waking one up

80
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:11,520
from feudal thought

81
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,360
in a nation imprisoned for thousands of years

82
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:15,000
is that easy?

83
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,560
Do you think

84
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,480
removing numbness, indifference

85
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:21,040
and outdated thinking

86
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,520
from our nation's blood,

87
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,960
is achieved in a day?

88
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:26,560
Once a man's mind is awakened,

89
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:29,040
the old order loses its foundation.

90
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,760
I was a young man,

91
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:33,080
a revolutionary who was determined to save the country.

92
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,320
I must

93
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,000
put myself in a position to die first.

94
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,720
I have to fight with them

95
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,560
because I love this country.

96
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,480
I will do something for this country.

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,760
I do it for them,

98
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,960
for them to be able to speak like a human being,

99
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,280
to have the rights of a human being,

100
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,960
to be happy,

101
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,360
to be dignified.

102
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:57,040
China is a people's country.

103
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:59,960
Thus the people should be in charge

104
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,560
and become their own masters.

105
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:04,880
This is what a country should do.

106
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:06,640
The founding of the Communist Party of China:

107
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:07,600
it's not just

108
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
the awakening of our intellectuals.

109
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,680
It is, above all, the awakening of the Chinese working class.

110
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,040
It is the awakening of all Chinese people.

111
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,480
It is the great awakening of the Chinese nation.

112
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,560
The Communist Party of China represents

113
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,200
the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people.

114
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:23,880
This is the rational and scientific nature of our Party today,

115
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,760
and the fundamental driving force

116
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,360
of the Communist Party of China,

117
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,920
which is vibrant and unstoppable.

118
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,320
China must take the socialist road.

119
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,000
Only then can it be realized:

120
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,640
the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

121
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:45,760
Socialism will never fail China!

122
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:54,160
[Age of Awakening]
