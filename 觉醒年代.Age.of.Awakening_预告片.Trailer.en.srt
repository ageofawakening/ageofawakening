1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,880
In 1915,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,960
World War I entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,000
Yuan Shikai's vain attempt to restore the monarchy

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,240
also gradually resurfaced.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,320
Domestic and foreign troubles have once again thrown China into turmoil.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,200
Kneel!

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,760
Twice in three years!

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
Zhongfu, get rid of your illusions and be ready to fight.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,960
We need to complete a great change that has not been seen in three thousand years,

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
defeat a powerful enemy that has not been met in three thousand years.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,520
Each generation has their duty.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
I'd like to invite you to Peking University as a liberal arts student,

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
and give the university a helping hand.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,040
With the efforts of all our colleagues,

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,920
our "New Youth" magazine has already accomplished in becoming

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,240
the most influential publication in China.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,600
We should use new ideas,

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:00,800
new culture,

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,600
new ethics,

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
to arm the minds of our members,

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,360
improve their conduct,

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
advance their knowledge.

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,800
This is also the first and only mission of our Xinmin Society.

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
Call on the masses of patriotic youth to consciously

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,560
transform their thinking.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
Combine social transformation

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,800
with the fundamental transformation of Chinese society.

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,560
We advocate new culture:

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200
this is to seek liberation in all aspects.

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,040
Our golden world,

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,120
our splendid world,

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,720
is right in front of us!

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,640
Use your journalist status

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,320
to get some people to write articles

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
directly aimed at Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei.

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
Make a big deal out of it. Make him look bad.

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,760
Chen Duxiu! Hypocrite!

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,040
Chen Duxiu! You don't deserve to be a teacher!

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Chen Duxiu! Hypocrite!

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,800
If we don't fight back,

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,920
the torch of new culture will be put out.

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,360
I will write another novel.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,720
I will compete with Lin Qinnan!

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,360
This debate over culture is just and dignified.

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,800
This is not natural!

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,000
How could you think of that?

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,320
I know you won't do anything to harm the people.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
We can't let people poke us in the back, can we?

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,560
I don't think people can live for themselves.

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,760
Go to Changxin

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
and take a look at the ruined shanties.

52
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,920
Go to Jinpu and take a look at them:

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
refugees with thousands of hungry people.

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
Go to Qianmen Street

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,960
and go see the the beggars begging along the street.

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Shouldn't we do something for them?

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,280
Are you asking us to be like you?

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
Clean and shiny?

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
Two proposals from your delegation,

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,040
none of them are in the authority of the peace conference.

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,400
The Shandong Peninsula

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
is not in the interests of China and Germany

63
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,760
but in the interets of Japan and Germany.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,920
Didn't we win?

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Germany was defeated!

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,680
Qingdao should be returned!

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
In defeat, one bides their time.

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
We shouldn't have to put up with powers anymore!

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,360
Weak countries get pushed around. This is the law of the world.

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
China is our Chinese people's China.

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
If we do not love our country,

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
who will love it?

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,680
Yeah!

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
The country is at its tipping point in time.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,120
We have to fight hard.

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,880
"Life and death for the country.

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
Is it because of fortune or misfortune?"

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,720
Do you think

79
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,000
waking one up

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,440
from feudal thought

81
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,280
in a nation imprisoned for thousands of years

82
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
is that easy?

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,400
Do you think

84
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,400
removing numbness, indifference

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,960
and outdated thinking

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
from our nation's blood,

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
is achieved in a day?

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Once a man's mind is awakened,

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,960
the old order loses its foundation.

90
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
I was a young man,

91
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
a revolutionary who was determined to save the country.

92
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,320
I must

93
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,960
put myself in a position to die first.

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,680
I have to fight with them

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
because I love this country.

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,320
I will do something for this country.

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
I do it for them,

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
for them to be able to speak like a human being,

99
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,200
to have the rights of a human being,

100
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,880
to be happy,

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,240
to be dignified.

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,960
China is a people's country.

103
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,840
Thus the people should be in charge

104
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,480
and become their own masters.

105
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,800
This is what a country should do.

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
The founding of the Communist Party of China:

107
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,520
it's not just

108
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,280
the awakening of our intellectuals.

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
It is, above all, the awakening of the Chinese working class.

110
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,880
It is the awakening of all Chinese people.

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,280
It is the great awakening of the Chinese nation.

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,440
The Communist Party of China represents

113
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,160
the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people.

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,840
This is the rational and scientific nature of our Party today,

115
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,640
and the fundamental driving force

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
of the Communist Party of China,

117
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
which is vibrant and unstoppable.

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
China must take the socialist road.

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,880
Only then can it be realized:

120
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,560
the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

121
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,680
Socialism will never fail China!

122
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:54,160
[Age of Awakening]
