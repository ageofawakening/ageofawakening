00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
That Zhang Xun really has his eye on you.

447
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
Now that Li Yuanhong has invited Zhang Xun into Beijing,

448
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,320
the rumour is his Queue Army is already at the city gates.
[Manchu style queue]

449
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,440
Exactly.

450
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,520
This is the second topic we need to discuss.

451
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,960
Here, take a seat.

452
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,960
Brother Zhongfu,

453
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
I feel like we don't need to discuss the second topic.

454
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,840
As I said,

455
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,560
I'm not afraid.

456
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,920
Some time ago,

457
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,520
I went back to my hometown in Hebei,

458
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
and set everything up for my family.

459
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
I will stay in Beijing.

460
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,240
If anything happens,

461
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
I will be the second Tan Sitong.
[martyr of the 1898 reform movement]

462
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,960
That is unacceptable.

463
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
"New Youth" and the new culture movement

464
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,000
cannot be without Li Dazhao.

465
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,480
Brother Zhongfu,

466
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
with the country as it is,

467
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,680
can you continue

468
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,800
publishing your "New Youth"?

469
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,480
Pardon my bluntness,

470
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
your twenty year old motto of not discussing politics

471
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,560
cannot still hold.

472
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,720
Shouchang, what do you mean?

473
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
My meaning is very clear.

474
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
That motto does not tally with China's reality.

475
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
You fool.

476
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,320
Shouchang,

477
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,520
I've always thought you were sensible and understood the true state of things.

478
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,960
How can you be so foolish?

479
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,880
Take a look at the quality of our citizenry at the moment.

480
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,640
How can you discuss politics with them!

481
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,560
Two restorations within three years.

482
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,440
Would this government

483
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,040
allow us to improve the quality of the citizenry?

484
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
Brother Zhongfu, throw away your fantasies and prepare for battle.

485
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,280
No.

486
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,560
In any case, I won't allow you to throw away your own life.

487
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,760
The China of the present

488
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,600
doesn't need you to be a Tan Sitong.

489
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,520
Shouchang.

490
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,440
Farewell.

491
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,680
In the nascent New Culture movement,

492
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,200
Li Dazhao

493
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
through editing “The Tiger Daily"

494
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
and Chen Duxiu through editing "New Youth"

495
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,400
echoed each other

496
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,400
in publishing numerous essays

497
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
focused on advocacy for democracy,

498
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
fiercely attacking feudalism

499
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
and outdated culture and ideologies.

500
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,800
Where they differed was Li Dazhao,

501
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,680
unlike Chen Duxiu, refused to avoid politics.

502
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,760
He advanced thorough critiques and investigation

503
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
of the political institutions of the time.

504
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,440
Conscientiously living up to the process

505
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,640
of becoming a social revolutionary,

506
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
and deepening the concepts 

507
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
of social revolution.

508
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,600
Where should we eat?

509
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,720
Brought the list of names?

510
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,440
Brought it.

511
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,920
Good.

512
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,960
Master Cai.

513
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,480
Eating, Master Cai?

514
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,000
Have you eaten?

515
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,640
We've eaten.

516
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,280
Come, eat together.

517
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,400
No, no, no. We won't be eating.

518
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,040
Eat this.

519
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,760
The beans aren't bad.

520
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,920
We came to discuss something with you.

521
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,160
Whatever it is, go ahead.

522
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,760
Sit and talk.

523
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,840
"New Youth" being co-edited at Peking University...

524
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,920
This matter hasn't been clarified.

525
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,800
Recently, because there's been a lot of work with the university,

526
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
it's been very hard to manage.

527
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
It's mainly been Deqian and Bannong,

528
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,640
who's been helping out.

529
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,760
We've discussed it and

530
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,440
I think the staff at "New Youth"

531
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,800
still needs to rely on Peking University.

532
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,040
So we would like to ask you, Master Cai,

533
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,200
to help facilitate two things.

534
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,920
"New Youth" ought to be a poster child

535
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
and banner for the new Peking University.

536
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,560
Whatever I need to do, go ahead and tell me.

537
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,600
Master Cai,

538
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,680
we've together compiled

539
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,840
a list of co-editors for "New Youth".

540
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,160
Good.

541
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,040
Please take a look.

542
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,600
Sure.

543
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,880
Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, Hu Shi

544
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
Qian Xuantong, Liu Bannong, Wu Yu, Gao Yihan

545
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,160
Shen Yinmo, Zhou Shuren

546
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,680
Terrific!

547
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
These are some of the New Culture Movement's top people.

548
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,120
Wonderful.

549
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,200
But isn't Hu Shi still in the United States?

550
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,000
Will he agree

551
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
to be a co-editor of "New Youth?"

552
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,520
He will soon graduate and return to China.

553
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,680
So the matter of him teaching at Peking University

554
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,280
needs to be settled as early as possible by you, sir.

555
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,400
Right.

556
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,440
Hu Shi

557
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,120
being appointed as a professor at Peking University is not a problem.

558
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,680
It's just, have you straightened it out with everyone else?

559
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,800
It's all been straightened out.

560
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,920
Why not sit and talk?

561
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,880
Ah, I can't sit.

562
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,160
It's all been set up.

563
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,200
But there are some people

564
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,640
who still needs some convincing.

565
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,680
Like Zhou Shuren.

566
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,960
Don't you know him very well?

567
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
I know Zhou Shuren very well.

568
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,160
I can handle it.

569
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Eat some beans.

570
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,880
Zhou Shuren

571
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
has recently been agitated about some things.

572
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,880
It'll be fine after some time.

573
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,160
This person is definitely not one for self-depravity.

574
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,800
Zhongfu, I just looked at your list of names.

575
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,000
Very good.

576
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,840
If these people all joined "New Youth"

577
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,400
then "New Youth" will be strong indeed.

578
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,320
That is why these people need to be

579
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,920
quickly recruited to Peking University.

580
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,320
Exactly.

581
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,200
Master Cai,

582
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,920
even though they are on the list of professors,

583
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,440
their appointment

584
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,280
will still be met with a certain degree of resistance.

585
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,760
That's right.

586
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:27,594
[Shen Yinmo, Professor at Peking University]

587
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,640
This is why we would like to ask you, sir, to decide earlier.

588
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,880
And in addition, would it be possible to specify

589
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,640
that "New Youth" is a Peking University publication?

590
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,760
That way

591
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,680
it would simplify our promotion and distribution.

592
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
It would also be more authoritative.

593
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,120
Zhongfu, come.

594
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,240
Sit, sit.

595
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,400
You two sit as well.

596
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,040
Sit.

597
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,680
Zhongfu, about this matter,

598
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,280
haven't I already said it many times?

599
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,480
We must

600
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,360
settle this in batches through various channels.

601
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,800
You don't need to worry.

602
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
The most troublesome should be Liu Bannong.

603
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
He could be first appointed as a preparatory course instructor.

604
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,880
But everyone else must be done in sequence.

605
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,200
I must remind you, Zhongfu,

606
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,120
not to give people an impression

607
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
of playing favoritism with your own little gang.

608
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,680
As for "New Youth"

609
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,160
I think it's better to leave it with you.

610
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,600
Don't run it under the name of Peking University.

611
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,840
This way, we can be more spontaneous.

612
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,840
Of course, the co-editors are all

613
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
actually professors of our Peking University.

614
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Which is to say "New Youth" is actually

615
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
also Peking University's.

616
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,080
Wouldn't it be good this way?

617
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,720
Master Cai, I truly am a little bit worried.

618
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
The reason I'm worried is

619
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
firstly, we're short-staffed.

620
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,440
Secondly, the situation is unstable.

621
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,560
Master Cai, how many days Li Yuanhong can remain president

622
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,600
no one knows.

623
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,800
As soon as things change,

624
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,400
Peking University, at the heart of the struggle,

625
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,560
can be overtaken by the older forces at any moment.

626
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,120
Only by preparing for the worst can one not fret while facing death.

627
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,240
Too true.

628
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
Zhongfu, I think you are overthinking it.

629
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,960
After Yuan Shikai,

630
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,520
it's true, the current political situation is volatile

631
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,600
and the war situation is in turmoil,

632
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
but the general state of affairs is still stable.

633
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,000
Li Yuanhong inviting Zhang Xun to Beijing by telegram to mediate

634
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,520
is for the purpose of easing tensions.

635
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
Therefore, everyone, don't be afraid of the sky falling.

636
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,200
Master Cai, but I've heard

637
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
that Zhang Xun's Queue Army is already at the city gates.

638
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,760
That's right.

639
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,280
And that Kang Youwei is also a guest of honour of his,

640
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,800
who will soon enter Beijing.

641
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,640
Master Cai, people have also said

642
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,600
Zhang Xun is in contact with the Imperial Palace.

643
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,680
He wants an audience with the emperor.

644
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,280
Furthermore, that Gu Hongming

645
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,880
has been especially excited recently,

646
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
telling everyone that there will soon be news about an emperor.

647
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,240
We can't not guard ourselves against all of this.

648
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,320
Mr. Cai.

649
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,400
No, no, no.

650
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,600
Tell everyone. It's all the same.

651
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,680
Mr. Wang Daxie just called.

652
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,960
Zhang Xun's Queue Army are about to enter the city.

653
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,880
Moreover, Kang Youwei is already in the city under a disguise.

654
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,360
You must hurry back home. There's going to be trouble.

655
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
Any delay, and you won't be able to leave.

656
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,800
You see.

657
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,680
Master Cai.

658
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,280
Then hurry home everyone.

659
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,000
We'll see tomorrow depending on the situation.

660
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,320
1919, June.

661
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,000
Zhang Xun led 5000 queued troops into Beijing.

662
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,280
Shouchang,

663
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:53,840
sir,

664
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,720
bad news.

665
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,240
Zhang Xun's Queue Army has entered the city.

666
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,680
He and Kang Youwei has reportedly

667
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,720
already entered the Imperial Palace.

668
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,920
Yuan Shikai's so-called emperor farce has just finished.

669
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,240
Zhang Xun dares to risk universal condemnation

670
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,600
and wants to restore the Qing.

671
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,360
Lunatic.

672
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,080
Zhang Xun's Manchu restoration has long been premeditated.

673
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,560
Shouchang, you must leave and hide.

674
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,560
You're on their list of names.

675
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,440
It's true.

676
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,000
Their troops and guns are already in the city.

677
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,560
Where would I hide?

678
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,000
Don't worry.

679
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,360
I'm certain this Zhang Xun

680
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,480
won't come to a good end.

681
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,560
How's this. Tomorrow you stay

682
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,440
and guard the "The Tiger" editorial office.

683
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
And the two of us see what the streets are like tomorrow.

684
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,000
Sure, I'll contact some more students.
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, student at Beijing Normal University's affiliated middle school]

685
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,360
I will write a pamphlet right now.

686
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,560
Go to Peking University.

687
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,240
Tell Guo Xingang and Deng Zhongxia

688
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,160
we'll meet up on Qianmen Avenue.

689
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,040
Sure.

690
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,680
But.

691
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,320
Gone are the heroes of yore, washed away by the Yangtze

692
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,760
Yet stately homes are still full of the sounds of revelry

693
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,520
A generation with empty drunken dreams

694
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,400
Ten disappointed years, leaving behind destitution

695
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,520
The half-furled bamboo screen lets in a rainy sky

696
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,840
The palm-leaf fan greets early autumn in Shanghai

697
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,680
Recalling the hopeless state of the land with nothing to say

698
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,280
Can only float together like boats on the Five Lakes.

699
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,480

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,480
