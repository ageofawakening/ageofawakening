00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,840
Dean Chen,

4
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:10,317
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,920
you are the flag carrier of new culture.

00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:12,112
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
What do you think, amongst those present today, 

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,292
[Gu Hongming, (?) Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,640
who, because they venerate Confucius,

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,480
are without virtue?

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,600
I've never thought those who venerate Confucius are without virtue.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,600
There are two kinds of people who venerate Confucius.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,120
Those who are academic Confucians.

14
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,406
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Professor at Peking University]

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,120
And those who are political Confucians.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,520
The discipline of Confucianism

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,640
was originally one school of thought out of the hundred

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,760
from the Spring and Autumn period.

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
One field of knowledge.

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,880
It is wide-ranging and profound, long-standing and well-established.

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,840
This is my passion for Chinese culture.

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
It should be respected.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,160
Peking University is the flagship institution of higher learning in China.

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,000
Teaching and studying Confucianism is the right thing to do.

25
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,320
Therefore, I have no objection.

26
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,440
People who have studied Confucius will be professors at Peking University.

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,960
Dean Chen.

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,040
I've heard a lot about Dean Chen.

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,160
He is a person who is frank on the outside as he is inside.

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,640
But today it's a bit of a misnomer.

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,440
"Smash Kong family's business!"
(pejorative term for Confucianism)

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,320

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,480
erected banner.

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,120
And under your command,

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,400
such as Yi Baisha in Hunan,

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,000
Wu Yu from Sichuan,

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,800
and Li Dazhao in Beijing,

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,440
Qian Xuantong of Peking University,

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,360
are all your daring vanguard.

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,360
On their bodies. (?)

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,200
There is no trace of respect for Confucius

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,960
and for Confucianism.

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,560
Not even a trace!

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,480
Not even a stitch!

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,000
How stitchless!

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
Professor Gu can enjoy reading

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,320
our "New Youth".

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,680
It is a great honor for me.

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
But Professor Gu doesn't seem to understand it very well.

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,680
This "New Youth" proposed to smash Kong family's business

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
It is not Confucius nor Confucianism.

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520
It is the Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues of Confucianism.

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
What we oppose is political respect for Confucius,

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
not academic respect for Confucius.

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,600
As we all know, Dong Zhongshu dismissed hundreds,

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,960
he has respected Confucianism alone.

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
This Confucius and Confucianism changed its form.

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,400
It became a weapon for the emperors to rule the country

59
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
and oppress the people.

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
As the saying goes, "ruler and subject,

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,920
father and son,

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,200
husband and wife".

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,280
It has choked the vitality of the country.

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
It has harmed the lives of the people.

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
It has hindered the progress of civilization.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,960
In a word, it has caused the backwardness of China.

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,560
Shouldn't these Three Fundamental Bonds of Confucianism

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,400
be smashed?

69
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,440
Aye.

70
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,960
Well said, well said.

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,000
Dean Chen is really a master of argumentation.

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,640
Confucius has been gone for more than two thousand years.

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,040
What does he have to do with our politics today?

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
For the backwardness of China today,

75
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:17,606
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Professor at Peking University]

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
should Old Master Kong be responsible?

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
Mr. Huang Kan, sit down and talk.

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,320
Dean Chen is too good at arguing.

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,120
Yes.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yuan Shikai's restoration of the monarchy, in order to become emperor,

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
means worshiping Confucius's doctrine as the state religion,

82
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,520
and respecting Confucianism as the national school of thought.

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,200
This is the politics at hand.

84
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Confucian feudal ethics to this day

85
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,240
still dominate social life,

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,240
enslaving the people's thoughts.

87
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,360
Isn't this the reason why China is backward?

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
Zhongfu, Zhongfu.

89
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,480
You're going a bit too far.

90
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,520
Your views

91
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
can be presented on the podium of Peking University.

92
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
What I'm asking you now is

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
that do you, as Dean of Liberal Arts,

94
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,120
agree that

95
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,880
academic level

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
is an important criterion

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
for our appointment of liberal arts professors at Peking University?

98
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,280
Master Cai, with all due respect,

99
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,360
I don't want to give a speech, but it always annoy me,

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Mr. Cai.

101
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,320
Forgive me for not being able to agree with you just now.

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,400
A Peking University professor.

103
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,280
The first criterion should be the teacher's morality.

104
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,720
If you are not virtuous enough,

105
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,120
you can't be a professor at Peking University no matter how good you are.

106
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,680
Professors are teachers.

107
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,840
We can't have a bad person

108
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,200
to set an example for students.

109
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,840
Right.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,720
Yeah, that's right.

111
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,360
Right.

112
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
This Mr. Zhongfu.

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,200
You are a little too melodramatic here.

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
Then tell me

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,960
which one of you is a bad person

116
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
Because Gu Tangsheng is not in favor of new culture,

117
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,520
is he a bad person?

118
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,720
Speak!

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,080
Right.

120
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Master Cai, don't get me wrong.

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,680
I never said Professor Gu was a bad person.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
That's why I put him

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,480
on the list of reappointed professors.

124
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,400
But now that we're here,

125
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,240
I will then also tell you all frankly

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,920
that some people have put it forward,

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,200
many people have put it forward.

128
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Peking University can't be regarded as

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
the umbrella of the royalist party.

130
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,920
Chen Zhongfu!

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
Make it clear!

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,720
Who is the umbrella?

133
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,917
Who is the royalist party? Speak!

134
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:20,471
Who is the royalist party?

135
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,360
Who is the umbrella?

136
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,680
Mr. Huang Kan, sit down and talk.

137
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,880
I won't sit down!

138
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
What I said is my opinion!

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
