00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360


238
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600


239
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,240


240
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400


241
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,720


242
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,280


243
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120


244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160


245
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080


246
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480


247
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,840


248
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,080


249
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,960


250
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,520


251
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760


252
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480


253
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040


254
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480


255
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880


256
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320


257
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,040


258
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,400


259
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120


260
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,440


261
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520


262
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480


263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400


264
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360


265
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,160


266
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160


267
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,320


268
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,680


269
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,080


270
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,880


271
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,080


272
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880


273
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,240


274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480


275
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,760


276
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,960


277
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920


278
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520


279
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960


280
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,480


281
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880


282
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,680


283
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,240


284
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880


285
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,840


286
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,000


287
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200


288
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880


289
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,840


290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000


291
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,480


292
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,200


293
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120


294
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,080


295
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680


296
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840


297
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,560


298
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,240


299
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,840


300
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880


301
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040


302
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560


303
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560


304
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720


305
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720


306
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320


307
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000


308
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,040


309
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240


310
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920


311
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,040


312
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,360


313
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680


314
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,960


315
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800


316
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880


317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800


318
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160


319
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240


320
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,240


321
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320


322
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760


323
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800


324
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200


325
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440


326
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720


327
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040


328
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960


329
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000


330
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360


331
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,280


332
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,200


333
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720


334
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,240


335
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,360


336
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760


337
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,880


338
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,480


339
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,120


340
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,640


341
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,640


342
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,440


343
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,720
Huang Kan came to see me today.

344
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,480
It was suggested by Lin Shu

345
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
that he and Liu Shipei

346
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
should be the editor-in-chief

347
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,240
of the magazine "National Heritage" in Peking University.

348
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,760
I have already granted him the funds for running a magazine.

349
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,760
It's clear

350
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,280
that it's for our "New Youth".

351
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,480
I don't care what his purpose is.

352
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
Academic disputes should still be encouraged.

353
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,920
Only by debates and rebuttals

354
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
can culture move forward.

355
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,560
Mr. Cai has been following this policy

356
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,640
since he entered Peking University.

357
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
Zhongfu's right.

358
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
This is good for Peking University

359
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,920
and Mr. Cai.

360
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240
Mr. Cai has been under a lot of pressure recently.

361
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,920
There are many rumors outside

362
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
that he is all-in-one in Peking University. (?)

363
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,920
(?)

364
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,880
(?)

365
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
First, it can gag some people. (?)

366
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,200
Secondly, it can also play

367
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,200
an active role in academia.

368
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920
That's why I asked you to discuss it,

369
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,080
in order to get everyone started.

370
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Set up more societies.

371
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,520
Start more publications.

372
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Only when everyone studies China's problems

373
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
can the country have hope.

374
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,480
Actually, after Mr. Cai assigned us a task,

375
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
I was really thinking about it.

376
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,280
Now I have an idea, brother Zhongfu.

377
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,440
Can we run

378
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,680
a "Chinese Youth" monthly magazine

379
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600
linked with "New Youth"?

380
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,360
You see,

381
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,480
with practice, struggle, perseverance and simplicity as the creed,

382
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,080
uniting youth of the whole country,

383
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
creating a new vitality in China

384
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,000
and a new era in East Asia.

385
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,560
Shouchang, your idea is very good.

386
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,520
I support it.

387
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,960
I have another idea.

388
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,880
Can we hold

389
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,960
a Marxist research society?

390
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
I think Marxism

391
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,280
is the highest level of scientific theory.

392
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,360
China should study it.

393
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,040
That's also a good idea.

394
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,520
Shouchang, I think your idea is aggressive.

395
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
Marxism is the theory of violence.

396
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,400


397
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,840


398
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
I think we should study it.

399
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,800
Now, Chinese people's understanding of Marxism

400
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,880
is ridiculous.

401
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,720
I went to a seminar the day before yesterday,

402
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,920
and a speaker

403
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440
said that Marxism

404
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,880
means that what I have belongs to me

405
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
and what you have also belongs to me.

406
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,600
Is it not ridiculous?

407
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,880
I still don't think

408
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,560
it should be too political.

409
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,520
Brother Zhongfu,

410
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,120
now you are the focus of attention.

411
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,960
Be careful wherever you go.

412
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,680
This is also a reminder

413
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,200
that it is not necessarily so straightforward

414
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,280
to make a fuss about names.

415
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,560
(?)

416
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,320
"Marxist" Research Society.

417
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,360
"Marxist"?

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,560
Alright.

419
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,400
It's ten o'clock.

420
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,600
I have to hurry home.

421
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,840
Why are you so punctual every day?

422
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,000
You have no idea

423
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
how difficult my little daughter-in-law is.

424
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
Before 10 o'clock every night,

425
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,880
she has to rush me

426
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
to go to bed quickly,

427
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
saying that I am forbidden to stay up late

428
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,960
because of my mother's orders.

429
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,320
If I don't listen,

430
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,840
she'll have to play hardball.

431
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,040
I really can't beat her.

432
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,320
You're a good boy.

433
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
What's the matter, brother Zhongfu?

434
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,800
Nothing, just a little confused.

435
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,080
You must go to bed on time at ten o'clock every night.

436
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,680
Why don't you let her play hardball?

437
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,920
How did she get so tough?

438
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
Why can't you beat her?

439
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,480
I'm really confused.

440
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,640
No, you don't understand this.

441
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,720
(?)

442
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
You two have broken mouths.

443
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
It's ten o'clock. I'm going home.

444
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
The library light is still on.

445
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,360
Who is studying so hard?

446
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,720
It's the new assistant, Mao Zedong.

447
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,840
He studies hard

448
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,880
until midnight every day.

449
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,800
I have seen this young man.

450
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
He has an unusual temperament.

451
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,240
Unusual temperament?

452
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,240
To get such praise from brother Zhongfu,

453
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,680
it seems that this person is really quite remarkable.

454
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,480
Now that you mention it,

455
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,080
I'll talk to him.

456
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
How about you two hurry home?

457
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,520
I really have to run,

458
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,720
brother Zhongfu, Shouchang,

459
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
or I'll miss the threshold at home. (?)

460
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,440
I can't go home,

461
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,320
I haven't finished my article yet.

462
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,320
Don't you write differently when you're at home?

463
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
There are so many rumors about you outside now.

464
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,520
You're not careful.

465
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,760
Gangsters are not worth mentioning.

466
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,920
Not to be feared.

467
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
You just don't think about yourself.

468
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,360
Think about your sister-in-law.

469
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
Your sister-in-law is different from Dong Xiu.

470
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,040
There is no threshold in our house. (?)

471
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,040
Runzhi.

472
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,320
Runzhi.

473
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,250
Mr. Shouchang!

474
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,000
Why are you here?

475
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,800
Eating chili peppers and reading books.

476
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,360
Mao Runzhi, you really have quite a personality.

477
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
Sit, sit.

478
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I...

479
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,200
just talked with Mr. Zhongfu,

480
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,800
saying how the lights in this room are still lit.

481
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,880
So I came to see you.

482
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
It's so spicy, what you're eating!

483
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,880
Sir,

484
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
I love to eat chili peppers!

485
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
What book are you reading?

486
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,120
"The Communist Manifesto"

487
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
I found it in that box over there.

488
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,680
What a pity though,

489
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,800
these are some paragraphs translated from Japanese.

490
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,920
It's not enough to fully understand.

491
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
This "Communist Manifesto"

492
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
is a profound article.

493
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
But it's a pity,

494
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,560
there's no Chinese translation.

495
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,080
I haven't read the full text either.

496
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,360
Although it's only a few paragraphs

497
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
of "The Communist Manifesto",

498
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,440
I'm already very excited

499
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,800
to read it.

500
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,400
You are quite right.

501
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,040
We

502
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,200
should get in touch with more new ideas.

503
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Only by comparison can we identify.

504
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,320
Sir,

505
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm full.

506
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,880
Finished.

507
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,600
Ah, what's the

508
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,520
new understanding

509
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,040
of that anarchism recently?

510
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,200
A new understanding is far from it. (?)

511
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,240
Ah, it's just that

512
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
in Changsha,

513
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
it's hard to get in touch with these new ideas.

514
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,600
Compared with this,

515
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,720
anarchism

516
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,160
will have a greater impact.

517
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,560
But this time?

518
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
I have been exposed to many new foreign ideas.

519
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
I was very touched.

520
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I just want to take the opportunity

521
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,400
to absorb it.

522
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,600
As for later,

523
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
digest it slowly.

524
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
We have a youth reading club in Peking University.

525
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,880
We often discuss some social issues and theories.

526
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
You can come and attend.

527
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,000
I'd like to go,

528
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
but I don't know if I'm qualified.

529
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
Of course you're qualified.

530
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,960
You have to attend

531
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,800
and you have to dare to speak.

532
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,160
Dare to argue

533
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,320
so that you can improve.

534
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,560
Okay.

535
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,760
I'll attend.

536
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:28,960
Sir,

537
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,600
I worked in Peking University during this time.

538
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,080
I have been exposed to so many new things.

539
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
It really opened my eyes.

540
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,920
What new things have you seen?

541
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,960
Tell me, let me hear it.

542
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,680
The topic

543
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
they are hotly discussing recently

544
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,400
is the Jin De Club.

545
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
What's your opinion

546
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
about this Jin De Club?

547
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,240
Please, sir.

548
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,800
Sir,

549
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,240
I think

550
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,000
this self-cultivation has existed since ancient times.

551
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
This is a distinctive feature of scholars.

552
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,360
But

553
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
Peking University puts emphasis on moral construction.

554
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,320
I think

555
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
it has a special meaning.

556
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,800
So what is this special meaning?

557
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,760
Tell me.

558
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,680
Sir,

559
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
Today's China

560
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,520
is in an era of great transformation.

561
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,760
The old morals are falling apart,

562
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,840
and new customs has not yet formed.

563
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,040
It is easy for people to be confused

564
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,160
and impetuous.

565
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
It's inevitable to lose morality.

566
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,280
Without the support of legal rules,

567
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,760
self-discipline is particularly important.

568
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
At this time,

569
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
Mr. Cai's advocacy of moral advancement

570
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
will have special significance.

571
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
In this impetuous era,

572
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,680
only self-disciplined people

573
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,000
can stand out

574
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,520
and achieve great things.

575
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
Very good, Mao Runzhi.

576
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,360
You're extraordinary.

577
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,920
I can't believe you can see beyond the surface.

578
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,800
At your age,

579
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,200
I didn't have your knowledge.

580
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,800
In this respect,

581
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
I am really ashamed of myself.

582
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,560
No wonder brother Zhongfu said

583
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,520
that you will achieve great things in the future.

584
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,320
Sir,

585
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,680
you flatter me.

586
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,160
No,

587
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
can I ask you a question?

588
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,960
Please ask,

589
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680
During this time,

590
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,640
when I'm in Peking University,

591
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,480
I had a prominent feeling

592
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
that I could feel innovation everywhere,

593
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,840
which made me feel full of vitality,

594
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,840
but there are many opponents,

595
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,640
and morality

596
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,920
became a weapon against innovation.

597
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,680
So,

598
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,400
I've been thinking

599
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
about a question all this time.

600
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
What is the difference

601
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,480
between morality and truth?

602
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,560
Do you have an answer to this question?

603
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,840
Not yet.

604
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,760
Let me tell you my opinion.

605
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,720
Morality is changing.

606
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
Truth is eternal.

607
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,720
This is a difference between the two.

608
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,440
Morality is both old and new.

609
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,200
If we measure the behavior of the new era

610
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,440
by the old morality.

611
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
What's this called, Runzhi?

612
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,000
This is called the defending moral principles against the historical trend.

613
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,800
So sticking to old-fashioned principles

614
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,480
is immoral.

615
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
Morality is used to discipline oneself,

616
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
not to blame others.

617
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,600
Morality is for practice,

618
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,240
not for empty talk.

619
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,560
No need to take notes.

620
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,000
We'll talk more often in the future.

621
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,160
Alright.

622
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
Then I will continue to listen to you.

623
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,280
The essence of morality is self-cultivation.

624
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720
The highest state of self-cultivation is the pursuit of truth.

625
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Pursuit is like purgatory.

626
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,080
Just like the Xuanzang Master

627
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,400
has to go through eighty-one difficult to learn from the scriptures. (?)

628
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
The reason why we founded "New Youth"

629
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,920
is to train a large number of Buddhist disciples

630
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,800
like Master Xuan Xuan

631
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,520
to find a cure for China,

632
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,360
which is suffering from illness and blindness.

633
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
I think this is called moral

634
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
Big morality (?)

635
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,600
Sir,

636
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,360
Have you found that cure?

637
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,160
Not yet.

638
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,520
But

639
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,000
we're already on our way.

640
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,840
Mr. Erhe, what do you mean?

641
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,480
I picked this up from the street.

642
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,000
Can you believe it?

643
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
This is not important.

644
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,320
The important thing is that things are getting worse.

645
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:55,069
[Tang Erhe, President of Beijing Medical College]

646
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,040
It's time for you to do something.

647
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,040
Tell me what measures I should take.

648
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,400
Stop the source.

649
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,480
I remember Chen Zhongfu's coming to Peking University

650
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,120
was recommended by you, Tang Er.

651
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,760
Brother Jiemin.

652
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,840
This is not the same time.

653
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,360
If it goes on like this,

654
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,040
it will not only hurt

655
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,560
Chen Zhongfu and "New Youth",

656
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,240
but also you brother Jiemin and Peking University.

657
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
I'll tell you.

658
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,360
First， I believe in Mr. Chen Zhongfu.

659
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,400
Second, we won't give in to those

660
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,120
who have bad intentions.

661
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,760
Greetings, Mr. Cai.

662
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,360
Good morning.

663
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,360
Mr. Cai.

664
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:58,320
Get up and get out of bed. (?)

665
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,560
(?)

666
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,400
What's wrong with you?

667
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,280
Why did you stay out all night?

668
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,440
Brother Jiemin, what-

669
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,960
What are you doing?

670
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,240
What are you doing here?

671
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,200
I... I...

672
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,480
You can't stay up so late.

673
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,920
I'm rushing for a story.

674
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,400
Brother Jiemin, wait for me.

675
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,120
I'll wash my face.

676
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,320
Never mind, never mind.

677
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,600
Hurry home and wash.

678
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,360
Go home, wash up and sleep.

679
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,480
Today's sunny,

680
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,680
what home am I going to?

681
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:29,920
No!

682
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,080
You go home, you take today off.

683
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,280
Take a day off.

684
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,680
I'm not going back. I have a lot of things to do.

685
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,760
Go back when I tell you to.

686
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,440
You have to listen to what I say.

687
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,480
From now on,

688
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,800
you can't stay here all night.

689
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,240
Do you hear me?

690
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,720
Brother Jiemin, what is wrong with you today?

691
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
What are you arguing at me for?

692
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
Dear brother, I'm afraid you're exhausted.

693
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
Here, quick.

694
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,680
Here, take it, take it, take it.

695
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
Look, look, look at this face, look.

696
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,440
Okay, go, you.

697
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,440


698
