00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,320
Fu Sinian,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,640
there are many people borrowing books today,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,160
understandably it will take longer.
[Mao Zedong, styled Runzhi, Peking University library assistant]

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,920
There's no need to be like this.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,600
He's new.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,360
Everyone, try to be understanding

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,800
and don't make a fuss.
[Chen Duxiu, styed Zhongfu, Peking University humanities chair]

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:17,920
Alright?

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,600
If you put it that way, sir,

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
then I won't be borrowing this book today.

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,880
Alright.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,160
Go read.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,520
Thank you, sir.

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,200
Runzhi,

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,800
my office is on the second floor,

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,760
right above you.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,880
Up the stairs, the first room on the east side.

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,360
I know.

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,560
Come by when you're free.

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,520
Let's have a chat.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,720
Yes, sir.

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,560
Many years later,

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
Mao said in his memoirs

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,160
that Chen Duxiu back then

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,640
was one of the people who influenced him the most.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,440
We're off.

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,000
Take care.

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,720
See you on the court.

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,600
Wait, wait for me.

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,560
Be right there, be right there.

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,280
That's enough, Old Guo.

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
Don't be angry. Eat first.

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,600
I can't.

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280
I've just truthfully shared

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
what I witnessed with the school.

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
A worthy teacher who sets an example for others

39
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,240
can't be this unfair.

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,600
That Mr. Song

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,640
actually said that I wanted

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,800
opportunistically slander that bastard Zhang Fengzai.

43
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,360
Hai Wei, am I that kind of person?

44
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,480
You can't use other people's unfairness

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,440
to punish yourself.

46
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,040
Whose body is it?

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,000
Yours.

48
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,440
Who's going to see you not eating?

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560
Don't think about it.

50
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,680
Eat first. Eat plenty.

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,480
Look who's here.

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
Such a stinky mouth. Eating shit?

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,840
Running to the dean's office

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
to tell on me.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,640
Not just you.

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
I was also told on.

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,040
What kind of deranged person

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,400
dares to tell on me.

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,000
Got a death wish.

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,800
Who are you talking about?

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
Who do you think I'm talking about?

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Chen Duxiu this hypocrite

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,880
can't produce any good students anyway.

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,240
Who dares to scheme against me,

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,320
I'm going to kill you.

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm...

67
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,240
Don't fight, don't fight.

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,880
Don't fight, don't fight.

69
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,160
Don't fight anymore.

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,320
You ought to be beaten.

71
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,080
Serves you right.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Idiot.

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
Second-uncle.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Have you been wronged?

75
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,840
The groundwork was just about to come to fruition.

76
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,200
Especially the street theatre incident.

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
The government's position

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
was already leaning towards our side.

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,320
But you insisted on clashing with them openly.

80
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
And now you've made yourself an object of ridicule.

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
Second-uncle, you don't know -

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,320
Those who do great things

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,960
must first undergo both mental trials and bodily hardships.

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,160
You must bear it.

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
I understand.

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
Go back to school tomorrow.

87
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
Continue to build momentum.

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
Yes, sir. May I be excused?

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,960
Stay where you are.

90
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,520
Does it still hurt?

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,880
No.

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,440
Keep a low profile.

93
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
I undestand.

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,360

113
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,040

Hello, sir.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
Chen Duxiu, hypocrite!

122
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
Yiping, take a few people to make a scene at his house.

123
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
Spread it out a bit more. Undestand?

124
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Go on.

125

Chen Duxiu, hypocrite!

126

The street theatre performances

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
organized by the school

128
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,560
has caused an incident.

129
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
The conflict between the modernizing and conservative factions

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,600
has intensified and even become politicized.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Our situation at Peking University

132
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
is one of internal strife and external aggression.
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Peking University professor]

133

Internal strife:

134
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
Yesterday, at the school canteen
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, Peking University principal]

135
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,400
students from the conservative and modernizing factions got into a fight.

136
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,840
I thought,

137
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,600
the university I, Cai Yuanpei, leads

138
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
is a place of learning.

139
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
How could a fight between students happen?

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,080
This is heartbeaking.
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Peking University library director]

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
Today,

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
there are students protesting at the school,

143
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
publicly calling for the dismissal of Mr. Chen Duxiu.

144
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
This is the internal strife.

145
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
External aggression:

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
All the big Beijing newspapers

147
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
have set their sights on Peking University.

148
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,880
I, Cai Yuanpei, and Chen Duxiu bear the brunt of their attacks.

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
Qian Xuantong, Hu Shi

150
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,920
are also targets of their attacks.

151
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,840
Some political organizations

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,880
such as the Anfu club

153
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,600
have also been drawn into the campaign to suppress the New Culture movement.

154
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,520
Let me read everyone

155
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,360
the Anfu club's official newspaper.

156
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,600
The name of their newspaper

157
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,960
is "Public Voice."

158
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,880
How do they put it?

159
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,000
Their headline is "Cai Yuanpei sends Peking University into chaos"

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
"Instilling social revolution

161
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
anarchy, and other such harmful teachings."

162
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,720
"Secretly carrying out destructive activities

163
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,760
while pretending to act self-righteous and neutral，

164
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,920
amassing all manner of unruly characters under his wing."

165
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
If they portrayl Mr. Cai as 

166
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
in opposition to the government

167
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
then this matter becomes very serious.

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,480
There's also a section here

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
that says "Capital police commissioner Wu Bingxiang

170
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
warns colleagues

171
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,560
we cannot respond without being well-armed."

172
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,120
This Wu Bingxiang character is very treacherous.

173
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,880
The words he said to me that day was full of concealed malice.

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,600
Exactly.

175
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
So the situation is very grim.

176
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,000
I've invited everyone here

177
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
to quickly discuss our next countermeasures.

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,280
What can we do?

179
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,960
If it's already been politicized,

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
then there's no more need for us to be secretive.

181
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
Let's go tit-for-tat.

182
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,120
The night after coming back from the police station

183
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
I wrote an essay.

184
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,080
The title is "The Political Problems of Today's China"

185
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,520
Consider it a public declaration that I, Chen Duxiu,

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,320
will no longer abide by my promise to not discuss politics for twenty years.

187
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,840
I've broken my vow.

188
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,560
The essay

189
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
will be published in this issue of "New Youth."

190
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,800
A sort of reply to Wu Bingxiang.

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
I have the same idea.

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,160
Never retreat.

193
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
It's like this.

194
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
We're not saying to retreat.

195
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,040
This is what I think.

196
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,560
We should try to avoid

197
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,880
conflicts with the government.

198
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,760
Whether it's difference of opinion, or disagreement,

199
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,320
it should be contained as much as possible within the scope of academia.

200
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,360
Of course,

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
in our development of the New Culture movement,

202
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
not only do we not retreat,

203
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,440
we must take the initiative and be proactive.

204
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,640
Today,

205
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,480
we want to discuss 

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
two things

207
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
with everybody.

208
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,680
The first,

209
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
we want to launch the New Culture movement

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,640
and expand the platform to spread our research.

211
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
For example, besides "New Youth"

212
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
we want to set up other newspapers and periodicals.

213
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
The second,

214
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,240
I will personally establish a Society for Advancing Morality.

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
"Great learning makes a teacher, and moral integrity makes a model."

216
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
Let's set a few precepts

217
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,640
following the standards of the New Culture movement,

218
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,960
and specify the expected conduct of members.

219
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
What does everyone think?

220
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
I fully approve.

221
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,720
Great. Great.

222
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,760
Very good, very good.

223
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,840
If no one has any objections,

224
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
these two things could be immediately arranged.

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
On the matter of setting up a publication,

226
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,440
we will have to trouble you, Zhongfu.

227
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,720
Alright.

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,880
The details of the Society for Advancing Morality, I will take care of.

229
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
The issue of students fighting

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
is truly concerning.

231
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,760
We cannot hand them a pretext for taking away our authority.

232
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,480
Mr. Cai Yuanpei has advocated for the establishment 

233
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
of a Society for Advancing Morality at Peking University.

234
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Next,

235
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
let me read

236
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
the written proposal Mr. Youcai has personally drawn up.

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
"Written Proposal"

238
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
"The Utility of Joining The Society for Advancing Morality"

239
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,240
Number 1: The Ability of Self Restraint.

240
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400
With the society's sanctions,

241
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,720
many will be less likely be overindulgent.

242
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,280
Number 2: The Ability to Decline.

243
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
The society provides a reason

244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160
one can give

245
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080
for refusing entanglements [such as accepting bribes, prostitutes]

246
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
without causing offence.

247
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,960
Number 3: The Ability to Stop Slander

248
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,520
With the society as the guarantee,

249
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
if everyone can keep to the rules,

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
slander of Peking University will be stopped

251
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,240
because there will be nothing to slander.

252
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040
Teachers and students of Peking University,

253
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
everyone who wishes to join

254
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
is required to fill in an application form,

255
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320
which clearly states their agreement in complying with the pact,

256
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,040
the membership level they are applying for,

257
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,400
and with a signature and seal.

258
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
This will be delivered to the council of the Society for Advancing Morality.

259
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,440
Everyone who passes the investigation of the council will be a member.

260
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520
The names of everyone successfully nominated

261
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
will be published in the Peking University Journal.

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Cai Yuanpei.

263
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
This is what the proposal says.

264
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,160
Next,

265
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
I will pass out more details from the proposal.

266
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,320
Zhong Xia,

267
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,680
help me out.

268
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,080
The Proposal is based on Three Nos.

269
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,880
No whoring, no gambling, no concubinage.

270
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,080
Based on three membership levels

271
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
students, teachers and staff can choose their level of commitment.

272
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,240
Class A members:

273
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
No whoring, no gambling, no concubinage.

274
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,760
Class B members:

275
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,960
In addition to the previous three prohibitions,

276
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
no taking positions as officials or government representatives.

277
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
Class C members:

278
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
In addition to the previous five prohibitions,

279
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,480
three more prohibitions of no smoking, no drinking, no eating meat.

280
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
These standards are pretty high.

281
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,680
True.

282
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,240
Looks like I could only be a Class A member.

283
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880
I will join as a Class B member.

284
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,840
I will not be an official or government representative.

285
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,000
But for me to not eat meat?

286
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
I can't do that.

287
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
So everyone knows the precise details.

288
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,840
We know.

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then pass it around to other students.

290
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,480
Alright.

291
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,200
Sure.

292
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120
Fellow colleagues,

293
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,080
the Society for Advancing Morality that Mr. Cai Yuanpei is proposing

294
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
is one way for people at Peking University

295
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840
to put New Culture into practice.

296
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,560
Our colleagues in the humanities department should vigorously respond
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Peking University Professor]

297
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,240
as models of the New Morality.

298
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,840
The meeting today

299
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880
only has one agenda item.

300
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040
Which is for everyone to sign up

301
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
and choose a level of membership.

302
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
There are three kinds of members.

303
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
Class A members have three prohibitions.

304
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
Class B members have five prohibitions.

305
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
Class C members hae eight prohibitions.

306
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000
I will stake out my position first.

307
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,040
Mr. Cai has already signed up as a Class B member.

308
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
I dare not compete with him.

309
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
I've always been on the unruly side.

310
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,040
So I will start from the most basic level.

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,360
I choose the Class A membership.

312
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
I will accompany Dean Chen as a Class A member.

313
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,960
I've always been fed up with officials

314
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
but it's truly difficult to give up meat.

315
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
I will choose the five prohibitions, and join Class B.

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
Great.

317
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Brother Shenshu, which class will you be?

318
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
None of them.

319
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,240
Brother Jigang,
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Peking University professor]

320
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
you are a scholar of antiquity.
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Peking University professor]

321
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
Which class will you join?

322
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
Well, Class A is three prohibitions.

323
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Class B is five.

324
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440
Class C is eight.

325
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
Allow me to decide after some time for consideration.

326
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040
Don't leave.

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
Professor Gu,

328
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000
it seems you find our Society for Advancing Morality

329
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
to be beneath contempt.
[Gu Hongming, styled Tangsheng, Peking University Professor]

330
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,280
On the contrary.

331
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,200
Ah I understand.

332
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
Professor Gu will surely choose Class C.

333
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,240
That's exactly it.

334
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,360
Class A.

335
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
Put me down.

336
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,880
Yes.

337
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,480
This guy.

338
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,120
"Put me down."

339
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,640
Come.

340
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,640
Everyone put a checkmark next to their choice.

341
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,440
Will do.

342
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,720


343
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,480


344
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480


345
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320


346
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,240


347
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,760


348
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,760


349
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,280


350
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,480


351
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600


352
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,920


353
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680


354
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,560


355
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,640


356
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120


357
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720


358
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,920


359
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240


360
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,920


361
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560


362
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,920


363
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,880


364
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720


365
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,200


366
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,200


367
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920


368
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,080


369
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680


370
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,520


371
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600


372
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200


373
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,480


374
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560


375
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,280


376
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,440


377
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,680


378
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600


379
