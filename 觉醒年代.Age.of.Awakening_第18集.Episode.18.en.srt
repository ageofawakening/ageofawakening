00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
can be used for reference by China,

702
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,240
despite the limitations in materials.

703
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,600
Let us please welcome Student Deng Zhongxia

704
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,760
to give us an introduction on the topic.

705
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,520
Welcome.

706
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,280
Let me briefly explain

707
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440
the background of Russia's October Revolution.

708
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:27,636
[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

709
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
Russia's October Revolution

710
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,360
took place on 7 November 1917.

711
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:33,443
[Chen Qiaonian, second eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

712
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,880
That night

713
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,640
under the command

714
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,080
of Bolshevik leader Lenin,

715
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
20,000 workers and soldiers

716
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,720
surrounded Petrograd,

717
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,360
and before sunrise gained control of the Winter Palace,

718
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,120
overthrowing the interim government,

719
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
establishing the first

720
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,520
dictatorship of the proletariat.

721
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
The October Revolution itself

722
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,400
was born under the guidance

723
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,520
of Marxism.

724
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,200
On the day of the successful armed uprising,

725
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,360
the Soviet Union Committee issued

726
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,680
the "Peace Act" and the "Land Act",

727
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,280
in which the "Land Act"

728
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,880
disregards all title deeds

729
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,400
and returns the ownership of land to the state,

730
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
for working peasants to use.

731
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
This is Marxism's

732
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,440
central socialist principle.

733
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
This the background of

734
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,600
Russia's October Revolution.

735
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,880
Thank you.

736
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,800
In my opinion,

737
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,880
the concept of state-owned land is nothing new.

738
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,880
After all, all land belongs to the king in a kingdom.

739
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:37,070
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

740
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,520
The essence of the matter has not changed.

741
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,800
Yannian, you are biased.

742
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,440
Let me tell you.

743
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,240
I believe

744
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
the October Revolution is a noble action

745
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,560
because it helped turned Marxism's

746
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,600
socialist theory

747
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,360
into reality,

748
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,080
and established

749
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,080
the first socialist country

750
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,080
based on public ownership

751
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,840
and dictatorship of the proletariat

752
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,360
in human history.

753
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,800
This is a historical moment.

754
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,160
It is not wrong to praise it highly.

755
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,360
I disagree.

756
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,720
The October Revolution

757
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,400
fundamentally was still a violent revolution.

758
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,200
In terms of their methods,

759
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,760
it is as violent as the other revolutions that have occurred in the past.

760
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,280
There was no use of new ideas.

761
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,960
The enforcement of common ownership is a novel idea.

762
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,880
But common ownership should be voluntary

763
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,320
with cooperation as the foundation,

764
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,880
instead of the use of force.

765
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,360
Your ideas are typical of anarchism.

766
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,960
It will not apply to China in reality.

767
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,000
Have you tried?

768
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,800
You have never tried,

769
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,240
so you cannot dismiss it as irrelevant to China.

770
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,600
The French philosopher Saint-Simon had tried

771
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,400
and failed.

772
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
Saint-Simon tried it out on an island,

773
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,680
it is not practical.

774
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,440
Saint-Simon believed in utopian socialism.

775
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,440
Quiet please!

776
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,360
Students! Students!

777
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,120
Please quiet down.

778
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Quiet down.

779
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,280
Quiet.

780
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,200
I really think that everyone has raised good points.

781
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,640
It seems that there are two sides.

782
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,000
One side is socialism.

783
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,520
The other is anarchism.

784
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,400
Right?

785
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,040
Whoever agrees with socialism, please raise your hand.

786
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,240
Alright put your hands down.

787
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,560
How about anarchism?

788
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,840
A tie.

789
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,160
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

790
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,400
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

791
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

792
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,200
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

793
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,880
Chen Duxiu, you are not fit to be a teacher!

794
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,360
Chen Duxiu, you have no morals!

795
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,480
Chen Duxiu out of Peking University!

796
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,840
What's going on?

797
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,040
I'm not sure.

798
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,560
He is a teacher.

799
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,080
A hypocrite!

800
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,880
Is this true?

801
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,640
Hypocrites to leave Peking University!

802
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,840
Leave Peking University!

803
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,120
Chen Duxiu has no morals!

804
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,480
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

805
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,680
What's going on?

806
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,000
Hypocrite!

807
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,280
No morals!

808
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,320
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

809
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,840
Scolding me at the doorway doesn't relieve much anger.

810
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,080
Come.

811
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
Come inside the garden and scold me.

812
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
Stand here and scold me.

813
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,320
Come on.

814
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,240
What's going on?

815
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,440
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

816
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,240
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

817
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,120
Chen Duxiu is a hypocrite!

818
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,640
Why don't the two of you come in for a chat?

819
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,720
It's fine, we have food at home.

820
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,800
The food's waiting at home.

821
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,920
Junman, since the thugs have come,

822
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,400
we shan't avoid.

823
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,560
Let us announce it today.

824
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,680
Zhongfu, you don't need to say it.

825
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Ever since I followed you from Anqing,

826
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
I have expected the consequences.

827
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,320
I am most familiar with

828
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,240
what kind of person you are.

829
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,080
Even though I am a housewife,

830
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,840
my heart is always with you in every moment.

831
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,600
Don't you always say,

832
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,400
only the immoral will start rumors?

833
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,280
If I minded these small protests,

834
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,800
like the buzzing of mosquitoes and flies,

835
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,680
and became upset,

836
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,520
I would not be

837
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
the Gao Junman that you searched for at the start.

838
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,640
Please sign here.

839
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,080
These is your books.

840
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,040
Thank you.

841
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,720
Runzhi.

842
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,280
Mr. Shouchang.

843
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,280
Here.

844
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,080
Sir,

845
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,960
what is this?

846
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,680
This is Peking University's journalism committee.

847
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,680
They are intending to recruit new members.

848
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,360
I have helped you to register.

849
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,960
Mr. Cai has agreed.

850
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,840
This afternoon,

851
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,440
the Commitee will invite

852
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Chief Editor Zhao Piaoping of the "Peking Gazette"

853
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,240
to come

854
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,040
and give a lecture on "Journalism Theory and Practice".

855
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,240
Please have a listen.

856
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,840
This is the admission document.

857
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,600
Have a listen.

858
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,200
Thank you.

859
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,160
This is great.

860
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,960
Thank you.

861
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,040
Mr. Zhao Piaoping.

862
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,080
His reputation preceeds him.

863
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,960
His name is like hearing a thunderclap.

864
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,440
People say he has iron shoulders and hot hands.

865
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,040
Today,

866
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,560
I can finally get to meet him.

867
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:42,960
Sir,

868
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,960
thank you for your help.

869
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,720
Runzhi,

870
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,680
Zhao Piaoping is not simple.

871
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,320
He is a scholar of the late Qing dynasty.

872
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,680
In 1912,

873
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,360
he assumed the role of Chief Editor of Hangzhou's "Hanmin Daily".

874
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,240
After that,

875
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,960
he was recruited by Director Shi Liangcai of Shanghai's "Shanghai News" (Shen Bao)

876
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,600
to take on the role of special resident journalist in Beijing.

877
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,280
His words are sharp as knives.

878
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,840
He is an all-rounder in the journalistic world.

879
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
He started recently at the "Peking Gazette",

880
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,520
assuming the role of director.

881
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,840
His passion is spreading novel ideas.

882
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,520
Attending his lessons

883
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,600
will allow you to learn a lot.

884
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,800
That's great.

885
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,840
Sir,

886
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,080
if I attend lessons in the afternoon,

887
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,080
what will happen to the work here?

888
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm still here.

889
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,320
Please don't worry.

890
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,280
Mr. Shouchang.

891
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,640
Sir,

892
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,440
I'm here to return a book.

893
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,880
Follow me.

894
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,480
Go.

895
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,400
Sir.

896
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,400
Thank you.

897
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,160
Come, student.

898
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,320
Three books.

899
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,040
Alright.

900
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,080
Welcome students.

901
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,120
Principal Cai has started this conference

902
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,640
called the Journalist conference.

903
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,480
Students, what does journalism mean to you?

904
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:54,594
[Zhao Piaoping, Chief Editor of the "Peking Gazette"]

905
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,000
What is the specific content

906
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,160
of this conference?

907
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:58,960
I think

908
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
this is the basic knowledge

909
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,600
that everyone here needs to know.

910
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,880
I believe

911
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,800
we need to look at the following points:

912
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,480
the foundations of news;

913
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,840
choosing the right topics for a newspaper;

914
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,440
how to collate news articles;

915
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,640
how to edit news articles;

916
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,000
how to transmit news;

917
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,960
et cetera.

918
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,320
In conclusion,

919
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,600
this is a complete study of what constitutes the news.

920
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,040
I know

921
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,480
everyone here

922
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,160
desires to become a journalist.

923
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,520
So I will like to invite

924
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,280
someone in this current society

925
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,280
to share what are the basic principles that one needs to have

926
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,800
in order to become a qualified journalist.

927
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,240
Please speak freely.

928
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
I am all ears.
