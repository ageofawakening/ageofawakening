00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,320
Fu Sinian,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,640
there are many people borrowing books today,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,160
understandably it will take longer.
[Mao Zedong, styled Runzhi, Peking University library assistant]

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,920
There's no need to be like this.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,600
He's new.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,360
Everyone, try to be understanding

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,800
and don't make a fuss.
[Chen Duxiu, styed Zhongfu, Peking University humanities chair]

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:17,920
Alright?

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,600
If you put it that way, sir,

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
then I won't be borrowing this book today.

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,880
Alright.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,160
Go read.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,520
Thank you, sir.

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,200
Runzhi,

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,800
my office is on the second floor,

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,760
right above you.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,880
Up the stairs, the first room on the east side.

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,360
I know.

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,560
Come by when you're free.

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,520
Let's have a chat.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,720
Yes, sir.

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,560
Many years later,

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
Mao said in his memoirs

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,160
that Chen Duxiu back then

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,640
was one of the people who influenced him the most.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,440
We're off.

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,000
Take care.

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,720
See you on the court.

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,600
Wait, wait for me.

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,560
Be right there, be right there.

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,280
That's enough, Old Guo.

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
Don't be angry. Eat first.

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,600
I can't.

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280
I've just truthfully shared

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
what I witnessed with the school.

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
A worthy teacher who sets an example for others

39
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,240
can't be this unfair.

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,600
That Mr. Song

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,640
actually said that I wanted

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,800
opportunistically slander that bastard Zhang Fengzai.

43
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,360
Hai Wei, am I that kind of person?

44
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,480
You can't use other people's unfairness

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,440
to punish yourself.

46
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,040
Whose body is it?

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,000
Yours.

48
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,440
Who's going to see you not eating?

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560
Don't think about it.

50
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,680
Eat first. Eat plenty.

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,480
Look who's here.

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
Such a stinky mouth. Eating shit?

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,840
Running to the dean's office

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
to tell on me.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,640
Not just you.

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
I was also told on.

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,040
What kind of deranged person

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,400
dares to tell on me.

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,000
Got a death wish.

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,800
Who are you talking about?

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
Who do you think I'm talking about?

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Chen Duxiu this hypocrite

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,880
can't produce any good students anyway.

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,240
Who dares to scheme against me,

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,320
I'm going to kill you.

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm...

67
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,240
Don't fight, don't fight.

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,880
Don't fight, don't fight.

69
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,160
Don't fight anymore.

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,320
You ought to be beaten.

71
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,080
Serves you right.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Idiot.

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
Second-uncle.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Have you been wronged?

75
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,840
The groundwork was just about to come to fruition.

76
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,200
Especially the street theatre incident.

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
The government's position

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
was already leaning towards our side.

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,320
But you insisted on clashing with them openly.

80
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
And now you've made yourself an object of ridicule.

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
Second-uncle, you don't know -

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,320
Those who do great things

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,960
must first undergo both mental trials and bodily hardships.

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,160
You must bear it.

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
I understand.

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
Go back to school tomorrow.

87
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
Continue to build momentum.

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
Yes, sir. May I be excused?

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,960
Stay where you are.

90
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,520
Does it still hurt?

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,880
No.

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,440
Keep a low profile.

93
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
I undestand.

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,360

113
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,040

Hello, sir.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
Chen Duxiu, hypocrite!

122
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
Yiping, take a few people to make a scene at his house.

123
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
Spread it out a bit more. Undestand?

124
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Go on.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,840
Chen Duxiu, hypocrite!

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
The street theatre performances

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
organized by the school

128
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,560
has caused an incident.

129
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
The conflict between the modernizing and conservative factions

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,600
has intensified and even become politicized.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Our situation at Peking University

132
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
is one of internal strife and external aggression.
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Peking University professor]

133

Internal strife:

134
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
Yesterday, at the school canteen
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, Peking University principal]

135
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,400
students from the conservative and modernizing factions got into a fight.

136
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,840
I thought,

137
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,600
the university I, Cai Yuanpei, leads

138
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
is a place of learning.

139
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
How could a fight between students happen?

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,080
This is heartbeaking.
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Peking University library director]

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
Today,

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
there are students protesting at the school,

143
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
publicly calling for the dismissal of Mr. Chen Duxiu.

144
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
This is the internal strife.

145
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
External aggression:

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
All the big Beijing newspapers

147
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
have set their sights on Peking University.

148
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,880
I, Cai Yuanpei, and Chen Duxiu bear the brunt of their attacks.

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
Qian Xuantong, Hu Shi

150
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,920
are also targets of their attacks.

151
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,840
Some political organizations

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,880
such as the Anfu club

153
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,600
have also been drawn into the campaign to suppress the New Culture movement.

154
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,520
Let me read everyone

155
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,360
the Anfu club's official newspaper.

156
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,600
The name of their newspaper

157
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,960
is "Public Voice."

158
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,880
How do they put it?

159
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,000
Their headline is "Cai Yuanpei sends Peking University into chaos"

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
"Instilling social revolution

161
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
anarchy, and other such harmful teachings."

162
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,720
"Secretly carrying out destructive activities

163
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,760
while pretending to act self-righteous and neutral，

164
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,920
amassing all manner of unruly characters under his wing."

165
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
If they portrayl Mr. Cai as

166
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
in opposition to the government

167
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
then this matter becomes very serious.

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,480
There's also a section here

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
that says "Capital police commissioner Wu Bingxiang

170
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
warns colleagues

171
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,560
we cannot respond without being well-armed."

172
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,120
This Wu Bingxiang character is very treacherous.

173
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,880
The words he said to me that day was full of concealed malice.

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,600
Exactly.

175
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
So the situation is very grim.

176
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,000
I've invited everyone here

177
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
to quickly discuss our next countermeasures.

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,280
What can we do?

179
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,960
If it's already been politicized,

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
then there's no more need for us to be secretive.

181
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
Let's go tit-for-tat.

182
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,120
The night after coming back from the police station

183
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
I wrote an essay.

184
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,080
The title is "The Political Problems of Today's China"

185
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,520
Consider it a public declaration that I, Chen Duxiu,

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,320
will no longer abide by my promise to not discuss politics for twenty years.

187
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,840
I've broken my vow.

188
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,560
The essay

189
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
will be published in this issue of "New Youth."

190
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,800
A sort of reply to Wu Bingxiang.

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
I have the same idea.

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,160
Never retreat.

193
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
It's like this.

194
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
We're not saying to retreat.

195
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,040
This is what I think.

196
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,560
We should try to avoid

197
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,880
conflicts with the government.

198
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,760
Whether it's difference of opinion, or disagreement,

199
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,320
it should be contained as much as possible within the scope of academia.

200
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,360
Of course,

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
in our development of the New Culture movement,

202
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
not only do we not retreat,

203
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,440
we must take the initiative and be proactive.

204
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,640
Today,

205
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,480
we want to discuss

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
two things

207
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
with everybody.

208
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,680
The first,

209
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
we want to launch the New Culture movement

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,640
and expand the platform to spread our research.

211
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
For example, besides "New Youth"

212
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
we want to set up other newspapers and periodicals.

213
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
The second,

214
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,240
I will personally establish a Society for Advancing Morality.

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
"Great learning makes a teacher, and moral integrity makes a model."

216
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
Let's set a few precepts

217
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,640
following the standards of the New Culture movement,

218
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,960
and specify the expected conduct of members.

219
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
What does everyone think?

220
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
I fully approve.

221
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,720
Great. Great.

222
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,760
Very good, very good.

223
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,840
If no one has any objections,

224
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
these two things could be immediately arranged.

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
On the matter of setting up a publication,

226
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,440
we will have to trouble you, Zhongfu.

227
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,720
Alright.

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,880
The details of the Society for Advancing Morality, I will take care of.

229
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
The issue of students fighting

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
is truly concerning.

231
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,760
We cannot hand them a pretext for taking away our authority.

232
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,480
Mr. Cai Yuanpei has advocated for the establishment

233
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
of a Society for Advancing Morality at Peking University.

234
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Next,

235
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
let me read

236
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
the written proposal Mr. Youcai has personally drawn up.

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
"Written Proposal"

238
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
"The Utility of Joining The Society for Advancing Morality"

239
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,240
Number 1: The Ability of Self Restraint.

240
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400
With the society's sanctions,

241
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,720
many will be less likely be overindulgent.

242
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,280
Number 2: The Ability to Decline.

243
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
The society provides a reason

244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160
one can give

245
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080
for refusing entanglements [such as accepting bribes, prostitutes]

246
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
without causing offence.

247
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,960
Number 3: The Ability to Stop Slander

248
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,520
With the society as the guarantee,

249
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
if everyone can keep to the rules,

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
slander of Peking University will be stopped

251
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,240
because there will be nothing to slander.

252
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040
Teachers and students of Peking University,

253
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
everyone who wishes to join

254
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
is required to fill in an application form,

255
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320
which clearly states their agreement in complying with the pact,

256
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,040
the membership level they are applying for,

257
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,400
and with a signature and seal.

258
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
This will be delivered to the council of the Society for Advancing Morality.

259
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,440
Everyone who passes the investigation of the council will be a member.

260
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520
The names of everyone successfully nominated

261
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
will be published in the Peking University Journal.

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Cai Yuanpei.

263
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
This is what the proposal says.

264
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,160
Next,

265
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
I will pass out more details from the proposal.

266
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,320
Zhong Xia,

267
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,680
help me out.

268
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,080
The Proposal is based on Three Nos.

269
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,880
No whoring, no gambling, no concubinage.

270
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,080
Based on three membership levels

271
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
students, teachers and staff can choose their level of commitment.

272
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,240
Class A members:

273
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
No whoring, no gambling, no concubinage.

274
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,760
Class B members:

275
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,960
In addition to the previous three prohibitions,

276
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
no taking positions as officials or government representatives.

277
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
Class C members:

278
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
In addition to the previous five prohibitions,

279
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,480
three more prohibitions of no smoking, no drinking, no eating meat.

280
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
These standards are pretty high.

281
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,680
True.

282
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,240
Looks like I could only be a Class A member.

283
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880
I will join as a Class B member.

284
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,840
I will not be an official or government representative.

285
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,000
But for me to not eat meat?

286
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
I can't do that.

287
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
So everyone knows the precise details.

288
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,840
We know.

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then pass it around to other students.

290
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,480
Alright.

291
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,200
Sure.

292
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120
Fellow colleagues,

293
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,080
the Society for Advancing Morality that Mr. Cai Yuanpei is proposing

294
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
is one way for people at Peking University

295
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840
to put New Culture into practice.

296
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,560
Our colleagues in the humanities department should vigorously respond
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Peking University Professor]

297
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,240
as models of the New Morality.

298
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,840
The meeting today

299
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880
only has one agenda item.

300
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040
Which is for everyone to sign up

301
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
and choose a level of membership.

302
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
There are three kinds of members.

303
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
Class A members have three prohibitions.

304
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
Class B members have five prohibitions.

305
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
Class C members hae eight prohibitions.

306
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000
I will stake out my position first.

307
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,040
Mr. Cai has already signed up as a Class B member.

308
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
I dare not compete with him.

309
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
I've always been on the unruly side.

310
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,040
So I will start from the most basic level.

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,360
I choose the Class A membership.

312
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
I will accompany Dean Chen as a Class A member.

313
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,960
I've always been fed up with officials

314
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
but it's truly difficult to give up meat.

315
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
I will choose the five prohibitions, and join Class B.

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
Great.

317
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Brother Shenshu, which class will you be?

318
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
None of them.

319
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,240
Brother Jigang,
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Peking University professor]

320
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
you are a scholar of antiquity.
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Peking University professor]

321
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
Which class will you join?

322
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
Well, Class A is three prohibitions.

323
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Class B is five.

324
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440
Class C is eight.

325
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
Allow me to decide after some time for consideration.

326
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040
Don't leave.

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
Professor Gu,

328
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000
it seems you find our Society for Advancing Morality

329
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
to be beneath contempt.
[Gu Hongming, styled Tangsheng, Peking University Professor]

330
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,280
On the contrary.

331
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,200
Ah I understand.

332
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
Professor Gu will surely choose Class C.

333
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,240
That's exactly it.

334
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,360
Class A.

335
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
Put me down.

336
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,880
Yes.

337
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,480
This guy.

338
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,120
"Put me down."

339
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,640
Come.

340
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,640
Everyone put a checkmark next to their choice.

341
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,440
Will do.

342
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,720
Huang Kan came to see me today.

343
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,480
It was suggested by Lin Shu

344
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
that he and Liu Shipei

345
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
should be the editor-in-chief

346
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,240
of the magazine "National Heritage" at Peking University.

347
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,760
I have already granted him the funds for running a magazine.

348
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,760
It's clear

349
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,280
that it's for our "New Youth".

350
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,480
I don't care what his purpose is.

351
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
Academic disputes should still be encouraged.

352
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,920
Only by debates and rebuttals

353
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
can culture move forward.

354
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,560
Mr. Cai has been following this policy

355
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,640
since he entered Peking University.

356
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
Zhongfu's right.

357
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
This is good for Peking University

358
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,920
and Mr. Cai.

359
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240
Mr. Cai has been under a lot of pressure recently.

360
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,920
There are a lot of rumors out there

361
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
that he's got it all figured out inside Peking University.

362
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,920
Run more magazines.

363
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,880
Raise more voices.

364
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
First, it can silence some people.

365
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,200
Second, it can also play

366
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,200
an active role in academia.

367
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920
That's why I asked you to discuss it,

368
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,080
in order to get everyone started.

369
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Set up more societies.

370
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,520
Start more publications.

371
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Only when everyone studies China's problems

372
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
can the country have hope.

373
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,480
Actually, after Mr. Cai assigned us a task,

374
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
I was really thinking about it.

375
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,280
Now I have an idea, brother Zhongfu.

376
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,440
Can we run

377
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,680
a "Chinese Youth" monthly magazine

378
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600
linked with "New Youth"?

379
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,360
You see,

380
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,480
with practice, struggle, perseverance and simplicity as the creed,

381
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,080
can we unite the youth of the whole country,

382
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
creating a new vitality in China

383
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,000
and a new era in East Asia.

384
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,560
Shouchang, your idea is very good.

385
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,520
I support it.

386
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,960
I have another idea.

387
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,880
Can we hold

388
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,960
a Marxist research society?

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
I think Marxism

390
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,280
is the highest level of scientific theory.

391
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,360
China should study it.

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,040
That's also a good idea.

393
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,520
Shouchang, I think your idea is aggressive.

394
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
Marxism is the theory of violence.

395
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,400
The Beiyang government isn't against this,

396
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,840
and it is easy to get into trouble.

397
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
I think we should study it.

398
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,800
Now, Chinese people's understanding of Marxism

399
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,880
is ridiculous.

400
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,720
I went to a seminar the day before yesterday.

401
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,920
There was a speaker

402
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440
who said that Marxism

403
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,880
means that what I have belongs to me

404
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
and what you have also belongs to me.

405
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,600
Is it not ridiculous?

406
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,880
I still don't think

407
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,560
it should be too political.

408
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,520
Brother Zhongfu,

409
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,120
now you are the focus of attention.

410
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,960
Be careful wherever you go.

411
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,680
This is also a reminder

412
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,200
that it is not necessarily so straightforward

413
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,280
to make a fuss about names.

414
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,560
Then let's say it one more time.

415
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,320
"Marxist" Research Society.

416
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,360
"Marxist"?

417
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,560
Alright.

418
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,400
It's ten o'clock.

419
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,600
I have to hurry home.

420
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,840
Why are you so punctual every day?

421
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,000
You have no idea

422
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
how difficult my little daughter-in-law is.

423
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
Before 10 o'clock every night,

424
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,880
she has to rush me

425
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
to go to bed quickly,

426
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
saying that I am forbidden to stay up late

427
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,960
because of my mother's orders.

428
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,320
If I don't listen,

429
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,840
she'll have to play hardball.

430
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,040
I really can't beat her.

431
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,320
You're a good boy.

432
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
What's the matter, brother Zhongfu?

433
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,800
Nothing, just a little confused.

434
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,080
You must go to bed on time at ten o'clock every night.

435
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,680
Why don't you let her play hardball?

436
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,920
How did she get so tough?

437
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
Why can't you beat her?

438
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,480
I'm really confused.

439
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,640
No, you don't understand this.

440
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,720
The tough professor pulled around by a hot-tempered woman.

441
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
You two have broken mouths.

442
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
It's ten o'clock. I'm going home.

443
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
The library light is still on.

444
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,360
Who is studying so hard?

445
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,720
It's the new assistant, Mao Zedong.

446
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,840
He studies hard

447
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,880
until midnight every day.

448
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,800
I have seen this young man.

449
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
He has an unusual temperament.

450
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,240
Unusual temperament?

451
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,240
To get such praise from brother Zhongfu,

452
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,680
it seems that this person is really quite remarkable.

453
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,480
Now that you mention it,

454
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,080
I'll talk to him.

455
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
How about you two hurry home?

456
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,520
I really have to run,

457
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,720
brother Zhongfu, Shouchang,

458
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
or I will arrive home past curfew.

459
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,440
I can't go home,

460
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,320
I haven't finished my article yet.

461
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,320
Don't you write differently when you're at home?

462
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
There are so many rumors about you outside now.

463
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,520
You're not careful.

464
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,760
Gangsters are not worth mentioning.

465
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,920
Not to be feared.

466
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
You just don't think about yourself.

467
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,360
Think about your sister-in-law.

468
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
Your sister-in-law is different from Dongxiu.

469
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,040
There is no curfew in our home.

470
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,040
Runzhi.

471
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,320
Runzhi.

472
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,200
Mr. Shouchang!

473
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,000
Why are you here?

474
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,800
Eating chili peppers and reading books.

475
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,360
Mao Runzhi, you really have quite a personality.

476
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
Sit, sit.

477
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I...

478
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,200
just talked with Mr. Zhongfu,

479
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,800
saying how the lights in this room are still lit.

480
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,880
So I came to see you.

481
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
It's so spicy, what you're eating!

482
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,880
Sir,

483
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
I love to eat chili peppers!

484
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
What book are you reading?

485
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,120
"The Communist Manifesto"

486
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
I found it in that box over there.

487
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,680
What a pity though,

488
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,800
these are some paragraphs translated from Japanese.

489
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,920
It's not enough to fully understand.

490
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
This "Communist Manifesto"

491
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
is a profound article.

492
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
But it's a pity,

493
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,560
there's no Chinese translation.

494
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,080
I haven't read the full text either.

495
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,360
Although it's only a few paragraphs

496
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
of "The Communist Manifesto",

497
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,440
I'm already very excited

498
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,800
to read it.

499
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,400
You are quite right.

500
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,040
We

501
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,200
should get in touch with more new ideas.

502
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Only by comparison can we identify.

503
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,320
Sir,

504
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm full.

505
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,880
Finished.

506
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,600
Ah, are there any

507
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,520
new insights

508
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,040
of that anarchism recently?

509
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,200
There aren't many new insights.

510
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,240
Ah, it's just that

511
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
in Changsha,

512
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
it's hard to get in touch with these new ideas.

513
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,600
Compared with this,

514
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,720
anarchism

515
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,160
will have a greater impact.

516
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,560
But this time?

517
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
I have been exposed to many new foreign ideas.

518
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
I was very touched.

519
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I just want to take the opportunity

520
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,400
to absorb it.

521
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,600
As for later,

522
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
digest it slowly.

523
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
We have a youth reading club in Peking University.

524
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,880
We often discuss some social issues and theories.

525
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
You can come and attend.

526
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,000
I'd like to go,

527
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
but I don't know if I'm qualified.

528
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
Of course you're qualified.

529
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,960
You have to attend

530
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,800
and you have to dare to speak.

531
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,160
Dare to argue

532
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,320
so that you can improve.

533
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,560
Okay.

534
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,760
I'll attend.

535
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:28,960
Sir,

536
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,600
I worked in Peking University during this time.

537
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,080
I have been exposed to so many new things.

538
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
It really opened my eyes.

539
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,920
What new things have you seen?

540
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,960
Tell me, let me hear it.

541
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,680
The topic

542
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
they are hotly discussing recently

543
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,400
is the Jinde Club.

544
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
What's your opinion

545
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
about this Jinde Club?

546
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,240
Please, sir.

547
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,800
Sir,

548
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,240
I think

549
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,000
this self-cultivation has existed since ancient times.

550
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
This is a distinctive feature of scholars.

551
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,360
But

552
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
Peking University puts emphasis on moral construction.

553
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,320
I think

554
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
it has a special meaning.

555
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,800
So what is this special meaning?

556
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,760
Tell me.

557
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,680
Sir,

558
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
Today's China

559
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,520
is in an era of great transformation.

560
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,760
The old morals are falling apart,

561
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,840
and new customs has not yet formed.

562
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,040
It is easy for people to be confused

563
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,160
and impetuous.

564
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
It's inevitable to lose morality.

565
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,280
Without the support of moral standards,

566
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,760
self-discipline is particularly important.

567
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
At this time,

568
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
Mr. Cai's advocacy of moral advancement

569
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
will have special significance.

570
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
In this impetuous era,

571
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,680
only self-disciplined people

572
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,000
can stand out

573
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,520
and achieve great things.

574
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
Very good, Mao Runzhi.

575
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,360
You're extraordinary.

576
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,920
I can't believe you can see beyond the surface.

577
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,800
At your age,

578
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,200
I didn't have your knowledge.

579
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,800
In this respect,

580
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
I am really ashamed of myself.

581
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,560
No wonder brother Zhongfu said

582
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,520
that you will achieve great things in the future.

583
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,320
Sir,

584
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,680
you flatter me.

585
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,160
No,

586
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
can I ask you a question?

587
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,960
Please ask.

588
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680
During this time,

589
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,640
when I'm in Peking University,

590
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,480
I had a prominent feeling

591
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
that I could feel innovation everywhere,

592
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,840
which made me feel full of vitality,

593
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,840
but there are many opponents,

594
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,640
and morality

595
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,920
became a weapon against innovation.

596
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,680
So,

597
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,400
I've been thinking

598
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
about a question all this time.

599
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
What is the difference

600
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,480
between morality and truth?

601
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,560
Do you have an answer to this question?

602
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,840
Not yet.

603
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,760
Let me tell you my opinion.

604
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,720
Morality is changing.

605
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
Truth is eternal.

606
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,720
This is a difference between the two.

607
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,440
Morality is both old and new.

608
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,200
If we measure the behavior of the new era

609
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,440
by the old morality.

610
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
What's this called, Runzhi?

611
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,000
This is called the defending moral principles against the historical trend.

612
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,800
So sticking to old-fashioned principles

613
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,480
is immoral.

614
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
Morality is used to discipline oneself,

615
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
not to blame others.

616
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,600
Morality is for practice,

617
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,240
not for empty talk.

618
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,560
No need to take notes.

619
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,000
We'll talk more often in the future.

620
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,160
Alright.

621
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
Then I will continue to listen to you.

622
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,280
The essence of morality is self-cultivation.

623
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720
The highest state of self-cultivation is the pursuit of truth.

624
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Pursuit is like purgatory.

625
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,080
Just like Master Xuanzang

626
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,400
who had to go through eighty-one sufferings to learn from the scriptures.

627
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
The reason why we founded "New Youth"

628
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,920
is to train a large number of Buddhist disciples

629
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,800
like Master Xuanzang

630
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,520
to find a cure for China,

631
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,360
which is suffering from illness and blindness.

632
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
I think this is called morality,

633
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
telling great virtues.

634
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,600
Sir,

635
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,360
Have you found that cure?

636
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,160
Not yet.

637
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,520
But

638
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,000
we're already on our way.

639
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,840
Mr. Erhe, what do you mean?

640
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,480
I picked this up from the street.

641
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,000
Can you believe it?

642
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
This is not important.

643
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,320
The important thing is that things are getting worse.

644
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:55,069
[Tang Erhe, President of Beijing Medical College]

645
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,040
It's time for you to do something.

646
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,040
Tell me what measures I should take.

647
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,400
Stop the source.

648
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,480
I remember Chen Zhongfu's coming to Peking University

649
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,120
was recommended by you, Tang Er.

650
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,760
Brother Jiemin.

651
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,840
This is not the same time.

652
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,360
If it goes on like this,

653
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,040
it will not only hurt

654
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,560
Chen Zhongfu and "New Youth",

655
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,240
but also you brother Jiemin and Peking University.

656
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
I'll tell you.

657
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,360
First， I believe in Mr. Chen Zhongfu.

658
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,400
Second, we won't give in to those

659
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,120
who have bad intentions.

660
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,760
Greetings, Mr. Cai.

661
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,360
Good morning.

662
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,360
Mr. Cai.

663
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:58,320
Oh say, dear brother, get up you and get out of bed!
(江浙小调, Jiangsu-Zhejiang folk tune)

664
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,560
The sun is coming out and is shining on your buttocks!

665
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,400
What's wrong with you?

666
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,280
Why did you stay out all night?

667
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,440
Brother Jiemin, what-

668
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,960
What are you doing?

669
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,240
What are you doing here?

670
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,200
I... I...

671
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,480
You can't stay up so late.

672
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,920
I'm rushing for a story.

673
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,400
Brother Jiemin, wait for me.

674
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,120
I'll wash my face.

675
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,320
Never mind, never mind.

676
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,600
Hurry home and wash.

677
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,360
Go home, wash up and sleep.

678
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,480
Today's sunny,

679
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,680
what home am I going to?

680
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:29,920
No!

681
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,080
You go home, you take today off.

682
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,280
Take a day off.

683
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,680
I'm not going back. I have a lot of things to do.

684
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,760
Go back when I tell you to.

685
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,440
You have to listen to what I say.

686
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,480
From now on,

687
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,800
you can't stay here all night.

688
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,240
Do you hear me?

689
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,720
Brother Jiemin, what is wrong with you today?

690
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
What are you arguing at me for?

691
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
Dear brother, I'm afraid you're exhausted.

692
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
Here, quick.

693
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,680
Here, take it, take it, take it.

694
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
Look, look, look at this face, look.

695
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,440
Okay, go, you.

696
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,440


697
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,960


698
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,080


699
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,280

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640

00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,280


706
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:25,520


707
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440


708
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920

00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,520

00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,200

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,360

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,680
