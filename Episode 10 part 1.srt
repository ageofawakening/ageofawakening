00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,714
Age of Awakening

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:06,614
Episode 10

3
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:08,185
What the whole world believes in

4
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:13,900
The spirit of the Chinese People

5
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:17,243
Is now being manipulated by the various warlords

6
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:19,986
This country is finished

7
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:28,673
Its ruined

8
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,029
Bai Sha

9
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:35,192
You are a man of culture

10
00:00:35,193 --> 00:00:37,514
You are not suited for politics

11
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:39,714
Please do not plunge into despair

12
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:43,270
How about you join me to teach in Beijing University

13
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:44,801
We will write a new book

14
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,413
To rebuild the citizen's mindset

15
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:47,244
No, no no

16
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:50,978
Zhong Pu, I won't follow you to Beijing University

17
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,100
I am telling you

18
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,071
What you said about avoiding politics for 20 years is wrong

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,243
It's impossible!

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,743
What's left is to fight with this ruined society

21
00:00:59,877 --> 00:01:02,414
I will fight with all my life

22
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:16,329
Brother Meng Zou! Brother Meng Zou!

23
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:18,471
Mr Liu

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,500
Welcome Mr Liu

25
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,129
This is Mr Zhu Pu

26
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,600
Nice to meet you, Mr Zhu Pu

27
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:24,643
Nice to meet you as well

28
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:25,600
Brother Meng Zou,

29
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:29,200
I've heard that Mr Zhong Pu has arrived in Shanghai from Beijing

30
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,757
I've come to see him

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,079
That's great, welcome

32
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:33,286
I hope I'm not inconveniencing anyone

33
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:34,331
No, you are not

34
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:36,351
Please come in

35
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:39,747
Let's sit inside

36
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:43,935
Come

37
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:44,800
Thank you

38
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,371
Mr Zhong Pu please excuse this small gift

39
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:50,387
You are too gracious

40
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:55,242
Please sit

41
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:56,935
Mr Zhong Pu

42
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:58,443
I am here to discuss with you

43
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:00,571
Matters involving the children

44
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,147
Now the country is facing internal strife

45
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:06,591
Because of Zhang Xun's restoration, lessons have stopped

46
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,628
Even if we resume lessons

47
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,616
It will be during the next semester

48
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:12,986
Countless wars are happening overseas

49
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:16,322
So they want to go to France to work and study

50
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:19,579
I'm afraid we can't provide a schedule at such short notice

51
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:23,171
Mr Liu, what do you intend to do then?

52
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:25,981
I do not want to disrupt our children's futures

53
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:30,894
So I was thinking if both our families can work together

54
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:34,746
and send the 3 of them to America to study

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,659
I'll handle the paperwork

56
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,895
and expenses

57
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,406
Mr Liu,

58
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:42,657
This is already the second time you have brought this up

59
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:44,514
I appreciate your concern

60
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,186
and understand your feelings

61
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:50,457
But I will tell you frankly

62
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,457
I cannot agree to this

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,946
All these things

64
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:00,296
I think Mr Zhong Pu

65
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:03,900
has prepared for Yan Nian and Qiao Nian right?

66
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:04,943
Yes indeed

67
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:07,971
Parents want the best for their children

68
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:11,929
Mr Zhong Pu, Liu Mei is my only daughter

69
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:16,214
So I understand how you feel

70
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,435
I can really understand

71
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:20,821
a father's love for his children

72
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,611
But Mr Zhong Pu,

73
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:24,351
regarding this matter,

74
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,594
why are you so steadfast in your choice?

75
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,914
Mr Liu, please do not misunderstand

76
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:30,865
it's not being steadfast

77
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:34,618
Firstly I'm not able to decide on Yan Nian's behalf

78
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:36,586
Secondly Yan Nian

79
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,186
will never accept others' help

80
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:42,557
Let me tell you honestly

81
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:45,339
I'm worried about his attitude

82
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,777
because Yan Nian

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,145
is too disciplined and confident

84
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,400
I am not able to convince him

85
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:53,305
I feel extremely guilty

86
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:56,551
that as his father

87
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,909
I have no rights to speak

88
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:01,071
Mr Zhong Pu

89
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,186
The 2 children

90
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:05,957
 are already in a relationship

91
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:07,314
So I feel that

92
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:08,628
as elders

93
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,669
we should care about their future

94
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,220
This is an issue

95
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,330
The 2 children

96
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,829
are in what kind of relationship?

97
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,971
They

98
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:24,943
I'm not sure if I can explain it clearly

99
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:28,186
I understand

100
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:31,143
I'll talk to him

101
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:34,228
We need to establish the facts first

102
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,111
So we don't make any mistakes

103
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:38,714
Let me handle it

104
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,100
After I get an answer

105
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:42,443
We'll speak again 

106
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:44,800
Thank you so much

107
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,072
You're too gracious

108
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:49,500
I'll take my leave first

109
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:50,943
Why don't you stay for a meal

110
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:51,844
No no no

111
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:54,100
I know you haven't finished your previous discussion

112
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,457
No need to send me off

113
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:58,729
Alright, take your time

114
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,343
I'll wait for your response

115
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
Alright

116
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,243
Bai Sha

117
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:17,012
On the day of Zhang Xin's restoration

118
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:20,614
Li Da Zhao was forced to leave Beijing

119
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,236
He roamed about for countless months

120
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:25,129
and fell to the lowest rungs of society

121
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,235
to observe national sentiments

122
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,021
and to clear his thoughts

123
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:31,414
desperately finding a way to save his country

124
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:33,860
The restoration of Zhang Xun

125
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:35,072
signaled that

126
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:37,457
the plan for the establishment of a bourgeois republic in China

127
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,715
was completely stopped

128
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:40,240
A painful lesson

129
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,459
hastened the reform of the bourgeois

130
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:44,786
and caused a change in perception and criticism

131
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:46,365
The modern Chinese

132
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,612
started to realize 

133
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,046
that just relying on transplanting

134
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,875
western political ideology and methods

135
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,786
would not save China

136
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:55,132
Saving China would require starting from the basics

137
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,800
Apart from a cultural awakening

138
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:57,903
and enlightenment,

139
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:00,714
it is necessary to listen to the voices of the people

140
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:05,686
to find a suitable solution to reform China

141
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,379
Come here

142
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:14,557
Zhong Pu

143
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,857
Where is he

144
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,071
Uncle Wang

145
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:22,271
My father wouldn't have left right?

146
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:24,400
No, he wouldn't have

147
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:25,543
He would not have left before seeing the both of you

148
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:26,671
Even if he had left, he wouldn't have gone far

149
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,414
Would he have gone to Ji Xi?

150
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:31,443
to see Hu She?

151
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:32,315
I told you we shouldn't have come

152
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:34,171
Qiao Nian, let's go

153
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:35,171
Brother!

154
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:36,929
Yan Nian!

155
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:43,039
These are the buns your aunt steamed

156
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,439
I was afraid it would spoil in the hot weather so I heated it up again

157
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:49,322
Come

158
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:50,983
Yan Nian, come

159
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:51,751
Listen to Uncle

160
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:53,936
Come

161
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,135
Sit here

162
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:00,393
Look

163
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:01,728
I told you he hasn't left yet

164
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,629
He went to steam buns for you

165
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,387
Yesterday

166
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:06,054
your father said

167
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,903
to send these buns to school

168
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:10,158
Gao Jun Man helped me to steam it

169
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,562
he told me to eat it while travelling

170
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,571
It's quite a lot, so help yourself

171
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,929
Come let's eat

172
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:27,543
It's meat

173
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:34,430
Please eat, your aunt steamed it for you

174
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,929
Didn't you say it was meant for you

175
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,854
There are 2 different fillings

176
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:39,804
vegetarian and meat

177
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,182
I've finished the vegetarian filling

178
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,197
the meat filling is for you

179
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,786
Can you stop pretending

180
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:45,764
since when was there vegetarian fillings

181
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,377
Why do I not know about it?

182
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:48,975
You have eaten it

183
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,402
Your aunt steamed these buns for you

184
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,367
He intentionally left it for you

185
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:55,697
so please help yourself to it

186
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:56,985
Come, eat

187
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,196
Just to eat some buns

188
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:03,060
and you had to lie about vegetarian fillings

189
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:04,572
stop pretending

190
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:05,802
Speak honestly

191
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,496
I've finally managed to see you this time

192
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
so let's chat

193
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,112
Let's chat about 2 things

194
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:03,584
Firstly, the both of you have come out to see the world at such a young age

195
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,916
Makes me relieved to see the both of you so self-reliant

196
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:09,101
You want to go to France to work and study

197
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,520
I am supportive as well

198
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:14,562
But now there is a world war going on

199
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,847
there are many complications

200
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:18,586
Our country is also experiencing internal strife

201
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,686
You can't always remain at this French language centre

202
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,876
If you do not have a long term plan you will definitely have worries

203
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:25,752
i want to know

204
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,519
What are your thoughts

205
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,618
Both of us will walk this path alone

206
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,186
We won't rely on others and our family

207
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,729
To us, work-study

208
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:36,871
is the most appropriate path

209
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:39,421
We plan to study in France

210
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:41,164
we have a very strong foundation now

211
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,757
we will not give up halfway

212
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,143
So we have decided to remain in Shanghai to study

213
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:48,356
Ya Dong library's business is doing well

214
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:49,891
We should be able to work-study with no issues

215
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:51,667
Most importantly we have many books to read here

216
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:53,106
We can't bear to leave

217
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,149
That's right

218
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:56,535
We can go to Beijing during the holidays

219
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:00,898
Alright, since you have already thought hard about it

220
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:03,004
I will respect your wishes

221
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,134
Secondly,

222
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,937
can you tell me

223
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:14,129
what is your relationship with Liu Mei?

224
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,125
What do you mean

225
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:15,923
Don't you think that

226
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:17,552
everyone is curious about it?

227
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:19,069
I'm not surprised that people are curious

228
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,514
I did not expect you to be curious about it as well

229
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:22,904
Why not?

230
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:23,642
Because I feel that you

231
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:24,899
are not such a superficial person

232
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,800
Is it superficial for me to be concerned about you and Liu Mei?

233
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:31,772
Since you are as superficial as everyone else

234
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:33,029
I will tell you clearly

235
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,146
that I, Liu Mei and Qiao Nian

236
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:39,871
have a pure and noble relationship based on mutual cooperation 

237
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,094
I don't quite understand

238
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:46,757
Have you read Peter Kropotkin and Tolstoy's books

239
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:47,786
Yes I have

240
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,415
So you must know about mutualism

241
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,978
anarchism

242
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,070
and pan-laborism

243
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:53,396
I know a little

244
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:55,150
So you should know about

245
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:57,549
what is mankind's ideal state

246
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,771
I'm all ears

247
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,711
Mankind's most ideal state

248
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:01,976
is when the whole society

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,086
based on their own self discipline continuously 

250
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:05,404
self-improve

251
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,946
Everyone will work together

252
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:09,372
and form a relationship that transcends familial and romantic ties

253
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,757
Oh, so you and Liu Mei have this sort of relationship

254
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:16,450
This is what I desire

255
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:18,557
Then, other people get the impression

256
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:20,814
that you and her are a couple

257
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,137
A couple?

258
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:26,129
Like butterfly lovers, do you understand?

259
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,513
This is the difference in our generations

260
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,363
Your generation can't get rid of the obstacle of superficiality 

261
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:32,872
But to us,

262
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:34,629
that is our goal

263
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,600
What we desire

264
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,257
is an eternal pure and noble friendship

265
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:40,029
Does Liu Mei have the same understanding as you

266
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,748
Of course

267
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:42,440
Additionally, I am

268
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,802
imposing a self-discipline rule for myself

269
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,514
I call it the 6 prohibitions

270
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:46,585
what do you mean

271
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:49,026
They are no skiving, no watching of shows, no photography

272
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:50,916
No eating at restaurants, no talking about fashion

273
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,957
But most importantly, no dating, no private relationships

274
00:11:57,514 --> 00:12:00,948
If society is able to be disciplined 

275
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:03,660
and continuously self-improve,

276
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:05,765
everyone will come together

277
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,712
to form relationships that transcend familial and romantic ties

278
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:11,511
So doesn't that make me and your aunt

279
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:12,855
Your aunt and your Uncle Wang

280
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,129
your uncle Wang and you

281
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,902
Liu Mei and I

282
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,557
Liu Mei's parents and your aunt

283
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:18,747
the same type of relationship?

284
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:19,929
That would be it

285
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,843
Then why do you address your aunt as mother?

286
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:22,214
That's just a name

287
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:25,400
So what do you call me then?

288
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,260
I've always called you Chen Du Xiu

289
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,471
Mr Chen Du Xiu

290
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:43,030
Alright, I'll leave, please continue eating

291
00:12:46,186 --> 00:12:46,953
Zhong Pu

292
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:47,799
Zhong Pu where are you going?

293
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,515
I'm going back

294
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:51,571
Going back where? You didn't even bring your luggage

295
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:10,243
Here's some more

296
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Eat up

297
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
This was given by Mr Chen Du Xiu

298
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:17,257
Steamed by Miss Gao Jun Man

299
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,100
1917 August 14th

300
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,971
Duan Qi Rui announced

301
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:34,428
China is officially at war against Germany and Austria

302
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,251
Joining in the world war 1 allied countries

303
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:41,700
The allied countries and America

304
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:44,386
Promised the Chinese government that

305
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:50,671
they will sponsor China and allow China to receive the benefits she deserves

306
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:00,935
Lu Xun is an excellent writer

307
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:05,306
His work is far-reaching, deep in content, simple yet majestic

308
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:07,057
This is

309
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:11,120
filled with strong literary spirit and style

310
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,954
An absolute masterpiece

311
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,071
Look at it

312
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,400
Yi Mo, you're a great calligrapher and you understand the arts

313
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,660
Tell everyone what this seal means

314
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:22,629
My verdict is that it is extraordinary

315
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,929
Look at this seal

316
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:27,402
The words "Beijing university" written in seal script are written vertically

317
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,468
The "Beijing" at the top

318
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,809
Is written such that it looks like 2 people with their backs facing each other

319
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,426
The "university" at the bottom

320
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:35,398
Looks like a man standing straight

321
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:38,001
This is a man carrying 2 people on his back

322
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,413
Which then symbolizes a meaning of a crowd

323
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:42,644
This shows that Beijing University teachers

324
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,243
are shouldering the heavy responsibility of educating the people

325
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:46,435
Good

326
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:47,650
Well said!

327
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:49,659
In my opinion these 2 words

328
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,341
also has a symbolic meaning of being the pillar of society

329
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,443
Looks like it right

330
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,457
Mr Zhou put "Beijing" and "University"

331
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,776
to make it seem like a man's spine

332
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:03,657
He is trying to convey that Beijing University should become the backbone of this country, shouldering the progress and democracy of this society
