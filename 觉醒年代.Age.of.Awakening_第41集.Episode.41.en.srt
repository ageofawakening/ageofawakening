Come, Runzhi.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:13,920

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,080

6

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,200
How's the Zhang-expelling movement going in Hunan?

[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,240
Tell me about it quickly.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,680
This Jin Yunpeng

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,720
has promised

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,160
to solve things in Hunan.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,160
Now the warlords are fighting.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,760
Zhang Jingyao is under attack from all sides.

[Mao Zedong, styled Runzhi]

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,040
His defeat is inevitable.

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,520
So Runzhi,

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,680
after the Zhang-expelling movement,

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,520
where will Hunan go from here?

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,880
Have you ever thought about it?

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,600
Sir.

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
That's exactly what I want to ask you.

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,720
No.

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,480
Actually, I want to hear your opinion.

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,200
There are two main questions I have in mind

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,200
for the Zhang-expelling movement.

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,720
First,

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,880
only by relying on the great unity of the people

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
can the ideal of saving the country and the people be realized.

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,680
Second,

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,040
the efforts to achieve Hunan autonomy

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,120
after Zhang-expelling movement.

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
Very good, Runzhi.

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,240
Here, hold this.

35
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,600
You've caught both of these practical problems.

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,480
Good!

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
About the way of action of the great unity of the people,

38
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,400
there are two factions.

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
The first is the fierce faction of Marxism-Leninism.

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,160
The second is the moderates of Kropotkin.

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,600
What about you, Runzhi?

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,440
Which faction are you with?

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,760
To tell the truth,

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,760
I'm struggling now.

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,200
I've read a lot

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,080
about Russia's October Revolution.

47
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
I've put my heart on it.

48
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,040
But emotionally speaking,

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
I am still apprehensive

50
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
about violent revolution.

51
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,200
I probably lean more towards

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
moderate anarchist reformism.

53
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,160
Then, Runzhi,

54
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,040
how are you

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,440
going to improve Hunan?

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,440
Right now, it's a warlord state.

57
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,120
After Zhang is expelled,

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,640
there will be a new warlord governor.

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,840
I know

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
that you and Mr. Zhongfu

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,680
both advocate the implementation of provincial autonomy.

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,680
So I was thinking,

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
can we take the lead in Hunan?

64
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,920
After expelling Zhang,

65
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,480
we first get rid of the control of the Northern Warlords

66
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,440
and establish a true government based on the people.

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
Of course, this is just my idea.

68
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,560
I haven't figured it out yet.

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
So I want to hear your opinion.

70
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,880
Runzhi.

71
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,120
Two questions.

72
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,680
The first question,

73
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,680
I still suggest you

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
learn more about the Russian October Revolution

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
and Marxist ideas.

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
I might as well tell you explicitly.

77
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,440
I and Mr. Zhongfu

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
now have a firm belief in Marxism.

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,280
We are determined to emulate Russia

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,960
and take the socialist road,

81
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
because history has proved that

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,640
if China takes the road of reformism,

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
nothing will work at all.

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,960
Only the fundamental transformation of society

85
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,280
can save our country.

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,120
Scond question.

87
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
Runzhi, I suggest

88
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,440
putting your eyes further ahead.

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,720
Consider the issue of transforming Hunan

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
in the context of the overall plan

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
to transform the whole Chinese society.

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
This will save you a lot of detours.

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
Actually, sir,

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,600
I admire Marxism and socialism very much.

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,880
Furthermore,

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,600
I am also very interested in the Russian revolution.

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,400
I have already consulted with the comrades of Xinmin Society

98
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,080
to prepare to set up a Russian research society in Changsha.

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,120
At the same time,

100
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I also go to Russia to study or work-study

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,440
and study deeply

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,400
to see if China is suitable to take the Russian road,

103
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,880
and find this answer quickly.

104
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,760

I also set up a communist bookstore.

109

In our bookstore,

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,200
there are many books on the Russian revolution

111
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
and on Marxist theories,

112
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,560
and we often run recommended reading clubs.

113

I want to ask Mr. Zhongfu.

190
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
I haven't seen him for over a year.

191
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
I really want to have a good chat with him.

192
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
Good.

193
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,360
Brother Shouchang.

194
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,160
Mr. Cai,

195
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,800
what do you think?

196
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,560
Do you think this place is OK?

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
This place is particularly nice.

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,960
This is a residential building.

199
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
We have many communist books.

200
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,680
They all can be put here.

201
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,520
Save that Zhang Fengzai,

202
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,600
who will make things difficult for us, check us again.

203
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,760
Brother Shouchang,

204
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
don't take it lightly.

205
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
It's better to be cautious.

206
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,440
I suggest this bookstore

207
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,320
should have a more hidden name.

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,400
I have the name in mind.

209
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
Kangmuyizhai.

210
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,800
Kangmuyi?

211
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,640
Transliteration, and add a "zhai".

212
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,800
Interesting for a communist bookstore.

213
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
Very wise.

214
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,400
This name is also very bold.

215
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,360
I have something to do. I won't stay long.

216
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
Take care, Mr. Cai.

217
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,120
Take care, Mr. Cai.

218
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,720
Take care, Mr. Cai.

219
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,280
Thank you.

220
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,240
You are all busy.

221
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
Come, everybody.

222
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,360
Put all the work away.

223
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,800
Let's get ready to start class.

224
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,480
Everybody come back.

225
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,240
Today, is our Peking University

226
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
Marxist Theory Research Society's

227
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,320
first reading activity.

228
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
Let's welcome Mr. Li Dazhao

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
give a lecture on the "Communist Manifesto" for everyone.

230
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,320
Welcome.

231
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Students, the "Communist Manifesto"

232
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,200
was drafted by Karl Marx

233
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,280
and Friedrich Engels

234
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,320
as a program for the Communist League,

235
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
then completed by Marx.

236
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
So as for the basic principles of this manifesto,

237
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,720
I think it can be summarized as follows.

238
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
In any historical period,

239
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
the dominant mode of production and exchange

240
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
and the resulting social structure

241
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,640
are the foundations

242
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
upon which the political and spiritual history

243
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,760
of that historical period is built.

244
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,520
Only from this basis,

245
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
can history be explained.

246
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
Since the disintegration of primitive human society,

247
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,160
the whole history of mankind

248
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,720
is the history of class struggle.

249
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
This history includes

250
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,720
a series of developmental stages.

251
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,720
Now it has reached a stage

252
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,400
where the proletariat

253
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
cannot liberate itself from bourgeois domination

254
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,360
if it cannot at the same time free society as a whole

255
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
from the oppression of the bourgeoisie,

256
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,160
the division of the exploiting classes,

257
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,120
and class struggle.

258
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,600
Eliminate private ownership,

259
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
overthrow bourgeois rule,

260
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,160
and let the proletariat seize power,

261
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,160
and then step by step,

262
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
seize all the capital of the bourgeoisie.

263
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
Then concentrate the means of production in the hands of the state,

264
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
that is, the proletariat

265
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,960
has become the rulling class.

266
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,640
And then as soon as possible,

267
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
increase the total amount of productive forces.

268
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,840
This is the basic point of view of the "Communist Manifesto".

269
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,760
In this revolution,

270
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,880
what the proletarians will lose is only their chains,

271
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,400
and they will get the whole world.

272
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,840
This is the "Communist Manifesto"'s

273
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
last solemn declaration.

274
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
Mr. Shouchang.

[Grigori Voitinsky, Head of the Far Eastern Bureau]

283
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,680
So, next,

284
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
please ask the Russian Communist Party's

285

Mr. Voitinsky.

Let him tell you all a bit about Russia.

288
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,920
Welcome.

289
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,040
Comrades,

290
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,760
I am a member of the Far East Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party.

[Yang Mingzhai, Member of the Russian Communist Party]

292
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,400
This time, I am sent to China

293
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
by the Comintern and the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party

294
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,480
to understand the situation

295
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,800
and discuss some practical problems.

296
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
I heard that all of you here

297
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,920
are activists who participated in the May Fourth Movement.

298
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
I am very happy and honored.

299
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,680
I hope that in the future

300
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
I can often attend such meetings.

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
I also hope that in the future

302
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,120
I can communicate more with you.

303
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,160

[2 Old Yuyangli, French Concession, Shanghai]

307
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,080

309
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,160
I think Mr. Xingyan's arrangement is right.

[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng]

314

So what does he suggest?

315
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
Stay in Shanghai for a few more days.

316
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,280
That makes two of us.

317
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,480
It may not be a bad idea

318
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,800
Is this the third home of "New Youth"?

319
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,360
My first home is my East Asia Library.

Not long ago he told me,

360
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,680
because he read "New Youth",

361
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,600
it has broadened his horizons and changed his destiny.

362

Shiyan, when are you going to France?

375
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
Around the beginning of May.

376
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,640
Well, it's still in a while.

377
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,960
This time I just want to prepare

378
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,720
Marxist Theory Research Society.

379
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,320
Come and join us.

380
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,600
Okay, I'll definitely attend.

381
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,120
Also,

382
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,240
you can also help me edit "New Youth".

383
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,520
I heard Shouchang say,

384
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
haven't you been to Changxindian?

385
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,280
I want to write an issue recently,

386
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,360
a special commemorative issue of May Day.

387
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,240
You can show me around some factories.

388
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,440
Great, sir.

389
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,120
What do you think of the workers' movement now?

390
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,160
So interested?

391
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,440
Not mildly interested.

392
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,520
I am very interested.

393
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,600
Shiyan.

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
Have you read the "Communist Manifesto"?

395
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,840
I do, I read it frequently.

396
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,520
It's just that no one has yet

397
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
translated it into Chinese.

398
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,920
If there is a Chinese version,

399
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
we can give a speech in the factory.

400
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,280
With no Chinese version,

401
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,960
you can still go to the factory to lecture.

402
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,240
A spectre. The spectre of communism

403
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,000
wanders around Europe.

404
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,880
To carry out a holy siege against this spectre,

405
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,680
all forces of old Europe,

406
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,560
the Pope, the Tsar, Metternich, Guizot,

407
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,040
French radicals, and German police

408
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,560
are all united.

409
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,760
Communists

410
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,120
disdain to conceal one's own views and intentions.

411
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,640
They publicly announced

412
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,480
their beliefs

413
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,920
can only be achieved

414
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
by violently overthrowing

415
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,280
the entire existing social system.

416
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,360
Let the ruling class

417
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,400
tremble in front of the communist revolution.

418
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,640
In this revolution, what the proletarians lose

419
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,400
are only their chains.

420
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,920
They will get the whole world.

421
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:52,240
All hunger strikers will never give up.

422
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:48,441
[Tianjin Police Department Prison]

423
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,160
All hunger strikers will never give up.

424
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,040
All hunger strikers--

425
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,848
Students, students.

426
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:00,800
Students, students, listen to me.

427
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
You haven't eaten for two days.

428
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,720
Shangfeng is in a hurry.

429
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,960
Your classmates and parents are also very anxious.

430
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,040
Please be quiet.

431
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,000
Stop the hunger strike

432
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
and we will try our best to meet your requirements.

433
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,040
Good.

434
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,200
There are three requirements for us.

435
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
First, public trial as soon as possible,

436
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
give the students a statement according to the law of the Republic of China.

437
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,640
Second,

438
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,920
improve detention conditions,

439
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
set up a special room

440
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
and make sure the arrested students are separated from other prisoners

441
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,680
to live together in the same place and move freely.

442
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
Third, give the arrested students

443
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,920
the provided list of newspaper materials and books.

444
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
Make sure students do exercises in groups,

445
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,920
have collective study, discussions,

446
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
and freedom of speech.

447
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
We will never give up until we get what we want.

448
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,040
Never give up until we get what we want!

449
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,920
Students, students.

450
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,960
Students.

451
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,800
I have already reported your request to my boss.

452
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,760
Never stop!

453
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,000
Never give up until we get what we want!

454
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,040
Students, listen to me.

455
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:56,691
Students, everyone listen to me. Listen to me!

456
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,480
Good news, good news.

457
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,880
The above authorities have all agreed to your requirements.

458
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
Now everyone can eat.

459
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,160
We won!

460
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,720
We won!

461
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
We won!

462
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,320
Students.

463
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,120
Prison can also be our laboratory.

464
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,640
What about today's speech?

465
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,720
Let me tell you about it.

466
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
Marx's historical materialism.

467
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,920
Marx's historical materialism has two main points.

468
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,680
First is the description of the experience of human civilization.

469
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,080
Second is the theory of evolution of social organization.

470
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,440
Marx believed

471
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
the sum of human social relations of production

472
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
constituted the structure of the social economy.

473
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,080
This is the basic structure of society,

474
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
that is, productivity.

475
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,120
As soon as productivity changes,

476
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,920
society must change with it.

477
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,480
Social organizations as relations of production.

478
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
is the same as our food and clothing.

479
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,360
It is the product of human output according to productivity.

480
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,560
Feudal societies produce princes.

481
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,760
Capitalist societies

482
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,000
produce steam mill industries.

483
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,640
Productivity determines the relations of production.

484
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,560
When the relations of production cannot satisfy

485
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
the requirements of the development of productive forces,

486
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,600
it is necessary to break the old production relations

487
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,400
and the shackles of the old social organizations on the new productive forces.

488
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,760
and create

489
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,160
new production relations that adapt to the development of productive forces.

490
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
This is social revolution.

491
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,640
Human society

492
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
is the continuous development of productive forces,

493
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,600
that constantly break the old relations of production

494
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,800
to create

495
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
new production relations adapted to the development of productive forces,

496
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,800
in order to realize the continuous development of society

497
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
from the lower stage to the higher stage.

498
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,000
This is Marx's unique historical materialism.

499
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,240
29 January 1920.

500
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,560
Until 17 July,

501
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,680
in a Tianjin prison, young Zhou Enlai

502
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,240
completed his ideological breakthrough.

503
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
The sprout of a revolutionary consciousness

504
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,640
began at this time.

505
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,440
I heard that not many people

507
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,560
are interested in Russians nowadays.

508
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,840
Not many people have gone to listen

509
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,040

510
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,160
Now it's just us people

512
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,480
as a loyal listeners.

513
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,600
No one else is coming.

514
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
Voitinsky put forward himself several times

515
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,720
to talk to you alone.

516
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,080
He also said he wanted to talk about some important things.

517
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
I know what he wants to talk to me about.

518
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
But it's too big.

519
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
I have to be considerate.

520
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,520
Listen to his tone.

521
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,880
He's already impatient.

522
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,320
This afternoon, then.

523
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,840

524
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Help me arrange it.

525
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,280
Very well.

526
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,760
What's Runzhi doing?

527
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,440
Runzhi went to Qufu.

528
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,680
He said he would go to the Confucius Temple in Qufu first,

529
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,800
then go to Shanghai.

530
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,240
Go to Confucius Temple.

531
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,000
Interesting.

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,200
Hello, sir.

537
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,000
Morning.

538
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,944
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

539
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,400
Have you heard from Zhongfu?

540
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,920
Yes, we often keep in touch.

541
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,360
He is in Shanghai now.

542
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,800
Concentrating on editing "New Youth"?

543
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
How come I haven't heard from him?

544
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,240
Shizhi, where can we find you?

545
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,440
Every day,

546
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,960
you're following Dewey's tail.

547

The day your sister-in-law Jun left,

548
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,840
I haven't seen you either.

549
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,440
I did have something that day.

550
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,720
I asked Dongxiu to see her off.

551
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,880
I heard that Chen Jionglang

552
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
wanted to invite Zhongfu to Guangdong

553
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
to become the chief of the education department.

554
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,720
When will he leave?

555
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,000
Who did you hear that from?

556
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,680
Brother Wang Mengzou wrote to me.

557
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,880
The news should be correct.

558
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,560
If that's the case,

559
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,320
I wish he would go to Guangzhou

560

00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:23,981
[Shi Cuntong]
[Yu Xiusong]

748
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,440
Hello, Mr. Zhongfu.

749
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,120
Hello, madam.

750
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,840
Hello.

751
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
Yu Xiusong. Shi Cuntong.

752
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,120
Great.

753
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,600
Sir.

754
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,880
It's very kind of you to come.

755
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,680
Junman hurriedly added a few more dishes.

756
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,960
We'll have two more drinks today.

757
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,320
Okay, okay, no problem.

758
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,600
Have a seat in your living room.

759
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,320
Come, come, please

760
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,320
We came from Beijing this time.

761
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,120
I went to you specially.

762
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,080
Now helping the "Weekly Review"--

763
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,760
You eat steamed stuffed bun firsts.

764
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,480
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

765
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,240
Great. We need someone right now.

766
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,040
We are preparing to set up

767
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,880
the Marxist Theory Research Society.

768
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,560
I can help you now.

769
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,280
Chen Wangdao and Li Hanjun.

770
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,520
Shiyan should also go abroad after a while.

771
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
You guys are just in time.

772
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,480
We come this time

773
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,760
just try and help you sir

774
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,640
with the workers' movement together.

775
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,480
So everything is at your disposal.

776
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,640
This workers' movement

777
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,400
is a key point of our future work.

778
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,320
This issue of our "New Youth"

779
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,760
is also a special issue to commemorate May Day International Labor Day.

780
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
But that's not the priority.

781
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,440
The urgent matter

782
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,280
is to build a national political party

783
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
to lead the workers' movement.

784
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,560
When we were in Beijing,

785
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,240
I heard Mr. Shouchang also talk about this matter.

786
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,920
Shouchang is in Peking University

787
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,920
establishing the Marxist Theory Research Society

788
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,640
and carrying out effective work.

789
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,960
The political conditions in the south are better than those in the north.

790
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,080
We can't fall behind.

791
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,920
Wangdao.

792
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,640
Just in time.

793
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,960
I'd like to introduce you to a new comrade.

794
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,360
This is my assistant, Mr. Chen Wangdao.

795
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,840
Mr. Chen.

796
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,960
You two are here, too.

797
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,480
You know each other.

798
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,000
We do.

799
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,520
We're colleagues in the "Weekly Review".

800
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,640
That's great.

801
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,000
What do you want?

802
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Sir, the "Communist Manifesto",

803
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,440
I have translated it all.

804
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,880
Please check, sir.

805
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,000
Great.

806
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,200
Great.

807
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,080
Wangdo, you have done a very important thing

808
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,160
for the Chinese revolution.

809
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,280
I believe history will never forget you.

810
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,640
Great, sir.

811
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
I'll stay up all night with you tonight.

812
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,440
See for yourself.

813
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,760
It's a pity.

814
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,440
It can't printed it before you go abroad

815
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,960
and take it to France.

816
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,120
It would be nice for Yannian and Qiaonian to see it.

817
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:37,840
It's fine.

818
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,280
They can read the French version over there.

819
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,080
Sir.

820
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,280
One more thing.

821
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,160
Say it.

822
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,400
It's okay. We're all comrades.

823
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,440
Just speak out what is in your mind.

824
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,320
Voitinsky, the international representative of the Communist Party

825
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
has arrived in Shanghai.

826
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,680
They brought Mr. Li Dazhao's

827
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,880
letter of recommendation for you

828
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,800
and hope to see you soon.

829
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,760
Can he speak Chinese?

830
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,880
They brought an interpreter.

831
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
The Chinese name is Yang Mingzhai.

832
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,760
He's a member of the Russian Communist Party.

833
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
This matter is very important.

834
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,720
They arranged to meet tomorrow.

835
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,880
This is Voitinsky.

836
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,960
This is Chen Duxiu.

837
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,600
Tell him to follow Chinese customs.

838
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,760
Then let's shake hands.

839
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
This will do.

840
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,400
Sit.

841
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,040
I heard that Mr. Chen Duxiu

842
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
is not particularly fond of Chinese traditional culture.

843
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,120
Nonsense. That's unfounded rumor.

844
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,240
At the age of 8, I read four books and five classics with my grandfather.

845
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,360
At the age of 18, he won the first place in the academic examination.

846
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,000
I speak confidently

847
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,680
of Chinese cultural tradition.

848
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,240
It cannot be separated from my heart.

849
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,400
I want to ask Professor Chen.

850
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,680
What do you think?

851
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,880
Marxism and the October Revolution in Russia.

852
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,080
I think Marxism

853
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
is the most scientific theory in the world today.

854
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
China's October Revolution road

855
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,680
is also an example for our Chinese revolution.

856
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,840
That's great.

857
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,280
Then we have a lot in common.

858
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,640
Let me show you something.

859
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,000
Welcome, Comrade Voitinsky.

860
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,080
Sit.

861
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,040
I am a member of the Far East Bureau of the Russian Communist Party.

862
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,040
This time, I was sent to China

863
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,160
by the Eastern Ethnic Branch of Siberia.

864
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,640
Now I have arrived China

865
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,680
in the hope of contacting

866
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,000
comrades who believe in communism in China

867
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,960
to discuss the possibility of establishing a party organization.

868
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,120
I heard that Mr. Chen Duxiu

869
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,520
is a famous Chinese thinker

870
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
and leader of mass movements.

871
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,040
Please give us your help.

872
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,560
As early as February this year,

873
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,360
I and Comrade Li Dazhao

874
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,680
have reached a consensus

875
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,720
on building a party in China.

876
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,240
After that, I made some substantive preparations.

877
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,000
Like Peking University's.

878
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,520
Marxist Theory Research Society

879
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,600
and the future Shanghai's

880
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,720
Marxist Research Society,

881
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,400
all these kinds of organizations.

882
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Now, we are working hard to build a party.

883
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,600
At the same time, I also hope to get

884
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,320
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Russian Communist Party

885
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,360
to mutually support and help each other.

886
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,000
Great. Let's hug.

887
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,960
I'm sorry, Comrade Voitinsky.

888
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
Embracing the Chinese tradition

889
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,160
means merging.

890
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,520
Later,

891
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,760
the Chinese and Russian parties

892
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,520
can be allied but not combined.

893
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,440
There is a tradition in China.

894
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,280
Asking one's brothers to settle scores.

895
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,800
You are you, I am me.

896
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,000
You can't lose yourself at any time.

897
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,480
So let's shake hands.

898
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:51,757
[April 1920, Voitinsky and other members of the Russian Communist Party approved by the Comintern arrived in China, met with Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, helped the Communist Party of China in its preparatory work.]

899
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:57,041
[Shanghai Workers' Club Evening School]

900
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,240
Fellow workers.

901
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,280
It's Labor Day soon.

902
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,360
This is our own festival.

903
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,200
We, the "New Youth" magazine,

904
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,960
is to publish a special commemorative issue for Labor Day,

905
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,880
not only to publish articles

906
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,960
but also to publish our workers'

907
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,680
own ideas and demands.

908
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,040
Today

909
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,120
is our evening class.

910
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,480
There are two main contents.

911
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,600
First,

912
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
our editor of "New Youth",

913
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,600
Comrade Chen Wangdao,

914
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,040
will give a speech.

915
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,080
Second,

916
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,720
I hope you will be interested in this issue

917
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,200
and put forward opinions and demands.

918
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,840
Hurrah!

919
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,400
Let's invite Comrade Chen Wangdao to give a speech now.

920
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,600
Hurrah!

921
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,240
Hurrah!

922
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,120
Hurrah!

923
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Comrades!

924
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,040
Who are the most useful people in the world?

925
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,080
Who are the most valuable?

926
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,400
There will be a group of confused people who say

927
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,960
the Emperor is the most useful and valuable,

928
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,680
or the scholar, or the bureaucrat

929
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,840
is most useful and valuable.

930
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,680
I thought they were wrong.

931
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,480
I thought only the workers

932
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,320
are most useful and valuable.

933
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,840
Hurrah!

934
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,920
Hurrah!

935
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,760
The food we eat is made by the people working in the fields.

936
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,440
Not by the Emperor, the President,

937
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,720
nor the bureaucrats.

938
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,680
The clothes we wear are made by tailors.

939
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,520
Not by the Emperor, the President,

940
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,720
nor the bureaucrats.

941
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,400
The homes we live in

942
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,440
are made by carpenters and bricklayers.

943
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,200
Not by the Emperor, the President,

944
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,000
nor the bureaucrats.
