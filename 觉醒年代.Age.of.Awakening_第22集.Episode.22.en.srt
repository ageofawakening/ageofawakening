[Episode Twenty-two]

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
Master, don't worry.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,520
If there is any cost

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,160
You guys!

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,360
Come to me.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,960
毛泽东

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,400
What I just said.

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,600
Do you understand

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,480
Listen to understand

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,360
What about us?

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,800
Just go to school with peace of mind

13
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,640
In case someone asks us for money.

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Let's find Mao Zedong.

15
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,760
Look for me. Look for me.

16
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,320
nicely

17
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,760
The people in our gardening room

18
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,360
All go to school.

19
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,080
nicely

20
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,000
Uncle Wang

21
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,040
Live and learn.

22
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,560
What a wonderful thing this is!

23
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,400
Don't run away.

24
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,560
I've made the second lap around Peking University.

25
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,280
Can you stop and listen to me for a moment?

26
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Is this stepping? Stepping on people?

27
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
What's your name, Mr Zhang?

28
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,840
Too funny.

29
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,040
This is my pen name.

30
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,040
But it is more famous than my real name.

31
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,480
Just tell me to step on people.

32
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:50,880
good

33
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,760
You can all call me stepping on people.

34
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
Okay, step on people, sir. Okay

35
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,480
Hello, hello, hello.

36
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,520
Here we are, right here.

37
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,640
Go!

38
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,000
Mr. Ren

39
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,000
Miss Liu

40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,960
There is one thing I want to explain to you.

41
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,920
You say

42
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,960
My identity as a journalist

43
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,800
It has never been exposed in Peking University.

44
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,480
So I can't interview students from Peking University.

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,080
Please understand me.

46
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,680
Understand

47
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,760
Of the four people we interviewed today 

48
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,880
There are no students from Peking University.

49
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,160
So you don't have to worry.

50
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,360
You don't have to meet them either.

51
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,080
don't worry

52
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,480
go

53
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,280
Here, let me help you.

54
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,760
I got it, I got it, I got it. 

55
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,200
thank you

56
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,240
This is the girls' dormitory

57
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,160
Comrades are waiting for you inside.

58
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,040
come

59
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,680
Let me introduce it to you.

60
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,720
And this one?

61
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,160
He is the reporter of the column "Learning from the Sea"

62
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
Mr. Ren

63
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,240
hello

64
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,680
welcome

65
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,200
thank you

66
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Step on people

67
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,960
The name sounds

68
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
Why are you a little bully?

69
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,000
This comrade

70
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,040
Have you been to school and read newspapers?

71
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,080
Yes!

72
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm listening in at the Women's Normal University now.

73
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,960
Read the newspaper every day

74
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
Since this is a

75
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,760
Female college students who read newspapers every day

76
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,160
Why haven't you even heard of stepping on people?

77
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,480
Please forgive me for stepping on my brother. 

78
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
Our comrade yi.

79
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,600
She was outspoken and meant no harm. 

80
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
Please don't care.

81
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,000
it doesn't matter

82
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,240
I just think your name is a little strange

83
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,360
Can't hold back for a moment.

84
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,160
offend

85
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,280
It's okay, it's okay.

86
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
Then let's get started.

87
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,240
Come on, let's go, let's go

88
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,440
Sit down, sit down.

89
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
Come and try it.

90
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,640
Thank you, thank you

91
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,440
Come and eat

92
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:33,760
you are welcome；not at all

93
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,080
this

94
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:34,720
Try

95
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
You're welcome. You're welcome

96
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,880
You eat and come, too

97
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
You eat too, you eat too.

98
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,480
thank you

99
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,880
Come and eat. You eat, too.

100
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,680
good

101
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
This comrade is very interesting

102
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,720
Take garlic as a snack

103
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,320
have a toothache

104
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,720
Good toothache

105
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Garlic is not good.

106
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,680
Disinfection

107
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,960
Then I'll tell you about our work-study mutual aid society.

108
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,920
Let me introduce it to you.

109
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,280
No introduction is necessary.

110
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
There will be another interview in China.

111
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Just pick out the important ones.

112
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,680
such

113
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
Miss Liu, please take the thirteen of you first

114
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,400
family background

115
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
Motivation and education. Tell me about it.

116
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,880
Isn't that still an introduction?

117
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,560
Comrade Yi

118
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Miss Liu, let's start with you

119
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,680
good

120
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,720
Pour water

121
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,320
I am Shanghai Aurora School.

122
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
Students in the French class

123
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
And no family background.

124
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,960
Join a work-study mutual aid society

125
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,960
There is no special reason.

126
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,640
Just feel fresh.

127
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
It can't be true

128
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Impossible to have no background.

129
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Mr. Kicker drinks water. 

130
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
excuse me/ sorry /feel bad/can't bring myself to ...

131
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,760
It's not kicking and stepping on people.

132
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,920
Sir, step on water and drink water.

133
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,680
Drink water.

134
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,920
She is embarrassed to tell you.

135
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,040
I told you.

136
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,200
Her father is Liu Wenyao, a tycoon in Shanghai.

137
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Miss Liu, you are too modest.

138
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
Comrade, who is your father?

139
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
Do you know Yi Manlong?

140
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Congressman Yi Manlong

141
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,520
Who doesn't know this?

142
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,480
You're new here, too.

143
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:08,960
almost

144
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,600
She is not

145
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,160
Ah, she escaped from marriage.

146
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,040
you

147
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,840
This can't be written in the article. 

148
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,280
This is going to be seen by my dad.

149
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,800
You have to kill me.

150
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
I think this is a good news point. 

151
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,600
Don't write, don't write.

152
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,280
I'll tell you a bigger news

153
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,920
What news?

154
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,400
Do you know who Liu Mei's boyfriend is?

155
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,520
who

156
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,240
He is the eldest son of the famous Chen Duxiu.

157
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
Chen Yannian

158
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
It's not what she said.

159
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,240
I have an ordinary gay relationship with Chen Yannian. 

160
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
Chen Yannian is also running a work-study mutual aid society.

161
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
Good thing. Great

162
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,640
I must write about you well.

163
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
I want to ask.

164
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,840
All the work of your mutual aid society

165
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,760
Are they all arranged by Chen Yannian?

166
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,480
yes

167
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,480
nicely

168
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:44,800


169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:44,880


170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Opium poisoning is not shallow.

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,200
I have been in China for a hundred years.

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
How much do heroes know?

173
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
It's pitiful to spend money.

174
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,400
thank you

175
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
Smoking is strictly prohibited as a child's play.

176
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,760
Now public sale will appear.

177
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,080
It's a trifle to laugh at outsiders.

178
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,160
How can I hurt my compatriots? 

179
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,440
Come to the movies.

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,200
Domestic film "Black Ghost"

181
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
Inside please

182
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,520
Watch a movie.

183
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,000
how about

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,640
How are the tickets selling?

185
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,440
Can we start the screening?

186
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,200
Almost 200 copies have been sold.

187
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,160
Great

188
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
You have been a great help to us.

189
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
Wait a minute. The movie is over.

190
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,560
We treat you to a midnight snack. 

191
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Comrade Yu Xiusong

192
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
Even your pants are communist.

193
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800
Treat people to night snack with what?

194
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,080
Comrade Yi Qunxian

195
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
Why are you talking about pants? 

196
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,080
alright

197
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,600
Wait till the movie is over. 

198
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
Shall I treat everyone to dinner?

199
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,160
thank you

200
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,720
thank you

201
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,080
You are not allowed to eat.

202
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,360
It's not your treat.

203
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
What do you care? You

204
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Yu Xiusong

205
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
Why can't the film hang up?

206
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,760
Come and have a look.

207
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,480
Okay, I'll be right there.

208
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,080
Okay, do you still have movie tickets?

209
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,880
Yes, yes, it will start soon.

210
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,040
A few?

211
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,120


212
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,360
A few?

213
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:53,840
Take two.

214
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Two tickets, please

215
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,840
Take this.

216
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,640
Watch a movie.

217
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,440
This way, please. This way, please

218
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Watch a movie, watch a movie.

219
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,400
Black ghost

220
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,360
I saw the movie, and it's about to start.

221
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,400
Domestic film

222
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
You're dressed in rags. 

223
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
What's going to happen again, Eiko? 

224
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Second uncle's big harvest

225
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,520
I finally found Chen Duxiu's soft help.

226
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
What kind of soft help?

227
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
Her two sons

228
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,200
What do you mean?

229
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
They are running a work-study mutual aid society. 

230
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,240
Implement a communist public wife

231
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Let's go see Master Lin.

232
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,480
good

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Master, Councillor Zhang is here.

234
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,560
What can I do for you at this late hour? 

235
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
please

236
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
my kind and respected master/teacher/mentor

237
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,360
Xiaofeng has two things to report to your old ticket. 

238
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,480
go ahead

239
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,640
First, sir

240
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,560
Sir, those two novels

241
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,840
I've arranged it.

242
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,680
Jingsheng will be held next week.

243
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
Shanghai New Declaration was published.

244
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
"Demon Dream" was published later.

245
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
Very good

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
As soon as these two novels are published

247
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Can give me a bad breath. 

248
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,880
In this way

249
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,240
Chen Duxiu Hu Shi 

250
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
The days of Qian Xuantong and the like

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
It's hard.

252
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,720
Come and sit.

253
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
Sir, this second

254
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,760
I learned that

255
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,840
Chen Duxiu acid made his two sons

256
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
Organized a work-study mutual aid society in Beijing.

257
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,400
Tangled with a dozen young men and women

258
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
Implement anarchic communism. 

259
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
These people live in groups.

260
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,840
Propagandize the fallacies of the West.

261
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,840
Destroy the government and be hostile to the family

262
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
Implement a communist public wife

263
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
It not only disturbs the society, but also corrupts public morals. 

264
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
Has aroused the public.

265
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
There are such things.

266
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
Who are these people?

267
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
Most of them are people around Peking University.

268
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,640
one more thing

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
蔡元培陈独秀李大钊等人

270
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,640
Fan some students

271
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
A lecture group on civilian education is being organized

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,040
Prepare their new culture

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,280
Move to street factories and hutongs.

274
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
And I heard.

275
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
I heard that your family

276
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,840
Is the live boots they attacked.

277
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,400
A wolf's ambition is like a pearl.

278
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,840
Be kind and don't worry.

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,040
Teacher, we are stepping up the collection of evidence.

280
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
Prepare to officially engrave Cai Yuanpei to Congress.

281
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
驱逐陈独秀

282
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Zhang Changli

283
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
You let me down.

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
You've said that a million times.

285
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Now Chen Duxiu Cai Yuanpei and them

286
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
Not only to overthrow our national religion

287
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
But also make what loss of human relations? 

288
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,080
The experiment of the communist wife 

289
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,640
As a congressman,

290
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,920
Where are your duties and beliefs?

291
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,200
Zhang Changli

292
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,840
Can you tell me the truth? 

293
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,400
Did you lose or not?

294
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,080


295
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,560
I really lost this time.

296
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
I used to be a loner.

297
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
I have a partner this time.

298
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
Senator Yi Long's daughter

299
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
I also joined the work-study mutual aid society.

300
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
We can use him.

301
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
Well, give me a definite word.

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
When will the motion of expelling Chen by Hei Cai be submitted?

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
Be kind and don't worry.

304
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,520
Teacher is now in Paris during the Peace Conference. 

305
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Xu Shichang asked Wu Bingxiang to strengthen the security of the capital. 

306
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Prevent students from making trouble.

307
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,880
And ordered the Ministry of Education to clean up the university discipline.

308
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,560
This is the right time.

309
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll find Yi Long.

310
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
Try to submit the bill next week.

311
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,880
What are you fighting for? You have to.

312
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,000
must

313
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Words don't count.

314
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
Count, count

315
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,760
Okay, this time, we must put

316
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Chen Duxiu, the demon engine, was expelled from Beijing.

317
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,080
be

318
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,520
Please come.

319
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
What did you say?

320
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
My daughter has fallen into a land of teeth and teeth. 

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
What's going on? Tell me. 

322
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
How dare I cheat Brother Yi?

323
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,200
Members of these mutual aid societies

324
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
Now, not only are fallacies preached everywhere.

325
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,760
Destroy the government

326
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
Still living in groups to be Communist hetaerism.

327
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
Even forcing members to join the club.

328
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,600
Cut off from the family 

329
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,920
Now it has aroused public anger.

330
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,640
It's all denounced up and down.

331
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
outrageous

332
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
outrageous

333
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
I'll take her back now.

334
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Yi Xiong Liu bu

335
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
Brother Yi, please sit down.

336
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
Come, come, sit down.

337
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
Brother Yi

338
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,360
I have another uninvited request.

339
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,040
You said

340
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,560
Yixiong

341
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,000
Do you know who started the mutual aid society?

342
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,040
who

343
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Now it is the young people who follow and admire.

344
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu

345
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
Your daughter must have been bewitched by them.

346
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,400
Just ran away from home and joined a support society.

347
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
Brother Yi can certainly take his daughter home. 

348
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
But this is a temporary solution rather than a permanent cure.

349
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,160
As long as we don't bring Cai Chen down

350
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,720
Your daughter can't really get out of danger. 

351
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
Return to family

352
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,920
Go ahead, Zhang.

353
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160
What do I need to do?

354
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,080
Brother Huan Yi can help me.

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,400
Submit to Congress

356
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,880
The proposal of exempting black Cai Yuanpei from expelling Chen Duxiu

357
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,520
Save thousands of students in from the mire.

358
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,040
Zhang did what Anne said.

359
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Thanks

360
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,080
President Da Cai has arrived.

361
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,360
The president is really in a state of affairs

362
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,280


363
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,520
Principal Cai

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
The president is calling you.

365
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
You Cai Zimin are here.

366
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,680
I have to live ten years less in Xu Shichang.

367
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
president

368
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
Who made you so angry? 

369
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,800
You called me here.

370
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Shall I listen to your posting?

371
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,480
Well, since you called me the president.

372
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,600
As the president of the Republic of China

373
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,680
Talk to you and Peking University.

374
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,040
please

375
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
I'm all ears

376
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
President Cai Yuanpei listens to the training

377
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,280
Now the Republic of China is in an extraordinary period. 

378
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,560
For decades

379
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
It was hard to win a battle.

380
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,240
Become a victorious country

381
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,480
Our country's representative is attending the peace conference in Paris. 

382
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,600
This will

383
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,920
It concerns the fundamental interests of the Republic of China.

384
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,200
You, President Cai, should earnestly fulfill your responsibilities.

385
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,960
Manage your school well.

386
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,040
Your students and teachers at school

387
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,480
Don't rock the boat and ruin the overall situation.

388
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,280
You're confused about the humble position of the president.

389
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,360
Excuse me, how did Peking University rock the boat? 

390
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,720
Destroy the overall situation 

391
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,920
Okay, okay, okay.

392
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,880
good

393
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
Look

394
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,000
Look

395
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,040
These pleadings

396
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,280
They all accuse you of Cai Yuanpei and Peking University.

397
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,880
Look at them all. 

398
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,640
Look at this.

399
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,320
This is Ma Qiyong, president of Confucius Church.

400
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,680
Tell Cai Yuanpei to forget his ancestors and subvert moral codes.

401
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
The complaint of losing human relations

402
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,880
I'll show you again.

403
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,280
Look at this.

404
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,480
President Duan Qirui has arrived.

405
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,200
Please proceed as soon as possible.

406
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
I'll be right there if you just play it by.

407
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,280
Chairman Cai is here. 

408
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,560
Please hurry.

409
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
People, bro

410
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480
The decision-making body is shady.

411
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,480
Have to shoot up to work.

412
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,600
What decision-making body?

413
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,960
I'll do it

414
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,000
It's my son's ear decoration.

415
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,440
I can see that there are great difficulties.

416
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,640
Your brother Bo Tang is also full of prison posts.

417
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,840
Stop talking about me.

418
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,240
What are you doing here with me?

419
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
Early in the morning, I was killed by President Xu Da. 

420
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
Call it over.

421
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm in front of the presidential palace.

422
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
I waited in line for an hour.

423
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
After entering the presidential palace?

424
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,720
Let President Xu scolded for half an hour again. 

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,400
What did he scold you for?

426
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
I said I advocated a new culture.

427
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,200
Now Peking University has become an eventful place. 

428
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
I want to pull back from the brink. 

429
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,440
Said it was a sensitive time for the Paris Peace Conference.

430
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,800
I have to respect myself.

431
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
Manage students and teachers well. 

432
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,840
Don't rock the boat and ruin the overall situation.

433
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,760
thank you

434
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
He has a guilty conscience.

435
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,880
Brother Tang, I don't understand.

436
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,160
The Paris Peace Conference should be said to be a grand meeting of victorious countries. 

437
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,760
Let's enjoy the fruits of the victorious country.

438
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,320
How is it a sensitive period?

439
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,600
Your people are so naive.

440
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
Do you still think we are a victorious country?

441
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,320
I don't understand.

442
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,880
So I came to ask you.

443
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,640
What do you want to know?

444
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,280
The more detailed the internal affairs, the better. 

445
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,720
It's not my job.

446
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,080
Diplomacy

447
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
Now it's the wind and the throat.

448
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
It's on the crater.

449
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,960
Maybe something big will happen someday. 

450
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
What's wrong with Paris? 

451
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,920
It's not just bad.

452
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,480
Then nobody likes it.

453
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,600
Paris Peace Conference is said to be a grand meeting of victorious countries.

454
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,280
But actually?

455
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,320
That is the meeting of the four countries: America, Britain, France and Italy.

456
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
Italy is ignored.

457
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,600
Mainly American President Wilson.

458
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
British Prime Minister Lloyd George

459
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
Have the final say with French Prime Minister Clemenceau.

460
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,440
According to regulations

461
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
Only when it comes to China's interests.

462
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
We can send two representatives to attend.

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
It's been more than ten days.

464
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
We didn't even get a chance to play.

465
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
A weak country has no diplomacy. I understand that.

466
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,160
What I care about

467
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,800
It's our time.

468
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,360
Can you get the Shandong Peninsula back?

469
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,360
That depends on the attitude of the Japanese. 

470
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,400
At present, the outlook is not optimistic.

471
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,080
What's wrong?

472
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,080
Liang Shizhi Cao Rulin these pro-Japanese factions.

473
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
Disapprove of China's unified railway management case 

474
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,760
Japanese minister Xiao Panna

475
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
Also lodged a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

476
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,720
This is the signal.

477
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,640
What about Wilson's attitude in America? 

478
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
He has been high-profile at first.

479
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,120
Raise the appetite of the Chinese people.

480
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,400
Don't talk now.

481
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,800
That's an ominous sign.

482
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
I've been in Paris for ten days.

483
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,400
Heads of state of the United States, Britain, France and Italy

484
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,680
I didn't see any of them.

485
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,920
Wang Da Lin Changmin in China

486
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,440
One day, a telegram asked me about my progress.

487
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,840
I can't hand in the proposal until I see it.

488
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,280
Where's the progress?

489
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,200
Guangzhou military government sent me to Paris.

490
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,640
I thought it was a beautiful job.

491
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
I didn't expect to be so timid. 

492
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
You thought it was for you to come to the scenery.

493
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,640
I told you it was a chore.

494
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,440
Maybe.

495
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,360
And ended up with a bad reputation.

496
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,080
Be prepared for this.

497
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,200
cabinet minister

498
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,400
Outside Chinese delegation's residence

499
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,600
Many Chinese have come to France.

500
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,640
Ask to see you.

501
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
Just say I'm looking for an Englishman.

502
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
There are several people here every day.

503
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
Posts and articles received by the door

504
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,280
I can't let it go now.

505
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,560
They want to do 

506
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,480
They want to do 

507
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,160
Center means one

508
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,880
Ask the Chinese delegation to stay out of the seven requirements.

509
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Cancel the clause of Article 21.

510
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
You can tell them clearly.

511
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
With the permission of the government

512
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,560
We have formally proposed it to the Peace Conference.

513
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,160
Application for Abolishing Article 21

514
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,840
But they want to see the results now.

515
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,920
The result has to wait.

516
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,160
It's not every day that we beg grandpa to sue grandma.

517
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,520
Please do me a favor?

518
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
Wilson said this beautifully.

519
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,600
But no one shows up.

520
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,800
What's this about?

521
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,000
Shaochuan

522
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
My body

523
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,920
It's really overwhelming.

524
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
I have to go to Switzerland to see a doctor

525
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
Shaochuan, I'll leave it to you.

526
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,880
Rutang

527
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,760
You know more about diplomacy than you do.

528
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
Just excuse me a little more.

529
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,600
National affairs are of great importance.

530
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,680
Don't worry, I don't care about ranking.

531
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,200
good

532
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,160
Then please.

533
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,280
Everyone is Chinese.

534
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,400
Distinguish between gains and losses

535
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,480
Good, little Sichuan said well.

536
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,560
We encourage each other. 

537
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,640
walk up

538
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
Sir, this is from Congress.

539
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
It is said that the Senate will hold an inquiry meeting next week. 

540
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,560
Ask questions about Peking University.

541
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,640
Please attend the meeting with Chen Xuechang.

542
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,920
What is Congress going to ask us about Peking University? 

543
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,360
I heard that a member of parliament jointly proposed to hack you.

544
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,400
sir

545
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,520
shoe

546
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,800
used to express displeasure or annoyance

547
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
Hang it all!

548
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,920
The capital is the first good area.

549
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
In order to maintain the security of the capital

550
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,560
During the Paris Peace Conference

551
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,280
Students are forbidden to carry banners and banners.

552
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,280
Go out in droves

553
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,440
Do not stay in public places for a long time.

554
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
No assembly speech.

555
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,280
Excuse me. Excuse me

556
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,480
Sell newspapers, sell newspapers, sell newspapers

557
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
Lin Lu, a master of Chinese studies, wrote the novel Jingsheng.

558
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,160
陈独秀为叛逆

559
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Sell newspapers

560
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
Newsboy, newsboy, please.

561
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,120
Good luck today

562
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,800
Someone sent us newspapers for free.

563
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,560
Said there was a reward for selling too much.

564
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
Sell newspapers

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,480
paper delivery boy

566
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,480
Let me see.

567
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
Read the newly published Shenzhou Daily.

568
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,680
New Youth is obsessed with Western cults.

569
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,560
Organize mutual aid societies to implement Communist hetaerism.

570
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,720
Read the newly published Shenzhou Daily.

571
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
New Youth is obsessed with Western cults.

572
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,680
Organize mutual aid societies to implement Communist hetaerism.

573
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
Something happened to Mr. Lu Xun 

574
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,080
Mr Lu Xun

575
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520
Here comes your opponent.

576
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Mr. Lin's novel Jingsheng

577
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,320
Than your "Diary of a Madman"

578
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,600
It's much better to write that.

579
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,120
Where's the power?

580
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,560
I'll read it to you.

581
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,920
Half a farmer just read a general idea.

582
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,160
Okay, then listen up. 

583
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
This novel Jingsheng

584
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,320
It's about a great husband

585
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
The story of beating up a crazy life

586
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Say strong.

587
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
Jing Sheng, a martial arts expert, stayed at Taoran Pavilion at night.

588
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,640
In the evening, I heard Tian Qimei from Anhui next door.

589
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,480
Zheren Jin Xin yi

590
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
And Dimo, who is new to American energy philosophy.

591
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,440
Three people are drinking and having fun, and they are raving.

592
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,680
Attack ancient prose and Confucius

593
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,360
This great husband Jing Sheng!

594
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,800
He was furious when he heard it.

595
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,680
He broke into the house and beat up three people.

596
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
Tian Qimei was knocked to the ground

597
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,680
Still want to plead

598
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,280
Then the great husband Yi pointed his finger at the head. 

599
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,240
Pain in the brain is like being pricked by a cone.

600
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,760
Practice Dimo with more feet 

601
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Diyaotong is about to break 

602
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
Zheren Jin Xin yi

603
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,120
He is nearsighted.

604
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,880
My glasses fell to the ground.

605
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,040
Kneel on the ground, sulfur head 

606
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,640
Fear of death is like a hedgehog. 

607
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,520
Needless to say, the result

608
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
It must be crazy and defeated

609
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,920
Jingsheng won a big victory, didn't he?

610
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,280
In my opinion

611
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,280
This Mr. Lin Qinnan is really talented

612
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,200
People's writing skills are comparable to Lu Xun's. 

613
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,640
It's really

614
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,320
I can't compete with others.

615
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,480
At most, I use a pen.

616
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,040
Mr. Green

617
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,240
Mr. Green, it's already started. 

618
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
Hubeiyang government

619
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
To suppress you demons!

620
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Have you all heard something?

621
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,240
Who are these three crazy students?

622
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,440
Wanren Tian Qimei, that's Chen Duxiu

623
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
Zheren Jin Xin yi

624
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,960
Qian Xuantong

625
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,960
Demo, a new American energy philosophy.

626
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,280
It must be our Hu Shi.

627
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
These three are real now.

628
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,920
A demon engine that confuses my ears with the words of animals. 

629
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,640
Thanks to Master Lin for giving his surname.

630
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,280
I'm a lucky man.

631
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Mr. Cai

632
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,600
Gong Cai xian sheng

633
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,800
You can still laugh.

634
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
All arrows are fired.

635
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,120
The latest issue of National Heritage magazine

636
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
I don't know if everyone has seen it. 

637
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
Huang, Editor-in-Chief of National Heritage Magazine

638
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
Hit Chen Duxiu Hu Shi by name

639
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,160
It is an easy photo of forgetting one's ancestors and corrupting the nation's morality.

640
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,680
Thank yourself?

641
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
He is a man of lofty ideals who brings order out of chaos and revitalizes Chao Gang. 

642
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,160
Save sven's aspiring youth.

643
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,560
And this.

644
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,120
This boring tabloid

645
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,440
It's full of attacks on Peking University.

646
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,560
And articles about new culture.

647
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,200
That's a long list of cards. It's so lively.

648
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,000
North-south attack

649
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,960
ten thousand arrows shoot at once

650
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,920
It's unbearable. It's unbearable.

651
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,080
I'm sure you gentlemen have seen it. 

652
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,800
What's the situation? It's a big one 

653
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
It's also very big.

654
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,880
But it's much more than that. 

655
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
President Xu Shichang called me in. 

656
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,880
When faced with my strict training with Peking University 

657
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,160
And the tone and words are very strict.

658
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,560
Congress also issued a notice.

659
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,600
Me and brother Zhongfu and others.

660
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,360
Go to Congress for questioning next week.

661
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,200
It really feels like a storm is coming.

662
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,400
So gentlemen, please analyze it.

663
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,080
Mr. Cai

664
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
I still don't need to analyze that sentence.

665
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,760
It's obvious

666
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,960
at the same time

667
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
South, north, two voices at the same time

668
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
One alludes to the novel. 

669
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,320
Go to war by name.

670
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
And these tabloid rumors are flying.

671
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
Now there's another Congress and a police department.

672
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
It was premeditated.

673
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,200
And it's a big deal

674
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
I saw a murderous look.

675
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,480
this time

676
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,040
Not only attack Zhongfu Shizhi Deqian

677
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
Even pointed the finger at Mr. Cai directly.

678
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,560
I think they're going to have a showdown.

679
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,080
These remarks of theirs

680
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,160
Yes, I have read them all carefully.

681
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,280
There are many.

682
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
Attack our work-study mutual aid society.

683
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,640
And the lecture group of civilian education. 

684
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,960
Obviously, it has been planned for a long time.

685
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,320
Rome is not build in one day

686
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,360
I feel old and new cultures.

687
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,880
It's time for a decisive battle.

688
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,160
Cooked or cooked, it's time to end it.

689
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,200
fight back

690
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
I can't stand it anymore. 

691
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,920
Gentlemen, don't get too excited.

692
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,280
Let's calm down first. 

693
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,720
Now that Mr Cai is here.

694
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
Let's listen to what Mr Cai has to say. 

695
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
Everyone knows that I am Cai Yuanpei. 

696
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,840
Always think that everything should be done step by step.

697
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,040
Don't be violent.

698
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,160
I've always thought that the struggle between old and new cultures

699
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,000
That's an academic dispute.

700
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
A hundred schools of thought should contend.

701
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,920
Old school or new school. 

702
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,240
Everyone is learning.

703
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,000
Are thinking about the way out for the development of this country. 

704
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,320
You shouldn't pull your hips with your sword.

705
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,400
Should not go to the point of life and death.

706
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,040
So I wrote a letter to Mr Lin Qinnan.

707
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,640
Ask him

708
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,160
Inscription on Liu Yingqiu's Works in Ming Dynasty

709
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,960
The meaning of this is that

710
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,160
In private, we are still friends. 

711
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,360
Cai Gong, you are just too kind and tolerant.

712
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,800
De, sit down.

713
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,000
Tolerance and kindness are always Cai Gong's style.

714
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,840
No, no, no.

715
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,040
Tolerance and kindness are our scholars.

716
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
Cultivate from an early age

717
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,480
But tolerance and kindness

718
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,920
It's not unlimited.

719
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
Let's look at this novel by Lin Qinnan.

720
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,720
The whole story is full of rumors and murderous.

721
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,160
Will put me to death, and then quickly.

722
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,680
Let's look at those members of Congress.

723
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
What's that called Zhang Zhang? 

724
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,640
Zhang Changli

725
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,120
What did he write in a joint letter?

726
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
It is said that Cai Yuanpei is not black.

727
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,520
There is no way out for education.

728
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,120
不驱逐陈独秀

729
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,040
There is no peace in the capital.

730
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,000
Well, Congress gave a notice 

731
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,920
Jingshi Police Department

732
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,240
Even the notices were posted on the doorstep. 

733
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,760
President Xu Shichang personally lectured. 

734
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
Lu Xun is right.

735
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
It's time for decisive battle.

736
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
My new novel "Kong Yiji"

737
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,480
It's almost finished.

738
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,800
Sir, I will write another novel. 

739
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,400
I'm going to compete with this Lin Qinnan

740
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,560
Well, since everyone agreed to fight back

741
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,880
Although thousands of people have gone.

742
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,560
It doesn't matter whether I Chen Duxiu goes or stays.

743
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
But I will never tolerate it.

744
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,560
They took us

745
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
A new cultural movement cultivated by hand.

746
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,560
Refuse to kill in the cradle

747
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,840
will start tomorrow

748
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,680
We four magazines go into battle together. 

749
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,040
I'm in charge of New Youth.

750
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,320
Shouchang is in charge of Weekly Review.

751
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,880
And "The Nation"

752
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,320
Shizhi, you're in charge of New Tide.

753
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,480
Everyone should write articles and show their magic.

754
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,840
Not just our magazine.

755
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,200
And mobilize students.

756
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,240
Contribute extensively to major newspapers and publications.

757
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
He's overwhelming.

758
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,040
Shizhi Shouchang

759
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
You have appeal among students.

760
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Get your students started.

761
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,680
Let the lecture group go to the street.

762
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,160
They all hit the door. 

763
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,920
Can we still be pussies?

764
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,040
中富

765
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Long live the New Culture Movement!

766
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,160
Long live the New Culture Movement!

767
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,120
Hooray, hooray!

768
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,120
Teacher, look.

769
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,680
This is a lot of media today.

770
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Yes, your novel Jingsheng

771
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,840
Made a response.

772
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
Get rave reviews.

773
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,440
I see Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu's good days.

774
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,600
At the end.

775
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,960
sir

776
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,800
There is this "Jingsheng" as a foreshadowing.

777
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,280
"Demon Dream" must be even more extraordinary.

778
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm sure.

779
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,720
These two novels by Mr.

780
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,240
Will be in the history of Chinese literature

781
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,840
Leave a colorful chapter

782
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,880
right

783
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,640
We hereby notify you of the New Declaration.

784
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,840
Don't publish "Demon Dream"

785
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,800
what

786
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,920
Why?

787
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,280
What's the matter?

788
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,920
Look at this.

789
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,600
this

790
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
Cai Yuanpei wrote you a letter.

791
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
Please edit it for publishing Ming Dynasty.

792
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,320
Inscriptions on Liu Yingqiu's Works 

793
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,160
What does this mean?

794
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,960
Meng wants to publish the works of Liu Yingqiu, a famous man.

795
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,520
Ask Cai Yuanpei to help introduce me and Liang Qichao. 

796
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,920
Zhang Yan Yan Fu, etc. Write a word or an inscription. 

797
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,560
Cai Heqing let bygones be bygones

798
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,080
Write to me personally and ask for help.

799
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,280
I am moved and shamed by the hanging statement.

800
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
What's the shame?

801
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
I regard him as a demon wall.

802
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,080
But he regarded me as a great sage.

803
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,360
Compared with the old shame, it's worth it. 

804
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
Think and think.

805
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,560
The "Demon Dream"

806
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,360
It was a direct attack on Cai Yuanpei. 

807
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,360
Let's get it back and not send it.

808
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,240
Teacher, your heart is too soft. 

809
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,920
I wonder if Cai Yuanpei read your novel.

810
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
Maybe I'm scared.

811
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,120
He came to please you. 

812
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,680
Don't be fooled.

813
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,480
yes

814
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,960
Probably not.

815
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
Cai Yuanpei wrote the letter five days ago.

816
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,560
At that time, Jingsheng had not been published. 

817
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,520
sir

818
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,920
Demon Dream has been published. 

819
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,680
I'm afraid it won't come back.

820
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
Hurry up and send a telegram to New Declaration.

821
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,640
Make sure they stop.

822
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,600
I'll pay for any loss. 

823
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,960
Sir, think twice.

824
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,360
this

825
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
This penalty plus compensation.

826
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
It's not a decimal

827
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,600
Money is small, personality is big.

828
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,160
I always laugh when I am old. 

829
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,600
But you can't bear the blame of returning good for evil. 

830
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
Teacher resents disciple bluntly.

831
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,160
You are too gullible.

832
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
It's too easy to compromise

833
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,600
We finally fought for peace with the government 

834
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,960
Together, a great situation of a new culture remains.

835
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,080
This makes you give up easily.

836
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,200
I'm not compromising.

837
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,880
The novel can not be published.

838
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,400
But my cultural position will never change.

839
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,160
I want to write an open letter to Cai Yuanpei.

840
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,320
Jin he indulged Chen Duxiu Hu Shi and others.

841
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,600
I want to defend the orthodox position of Tongcheng School.

842
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,400
Teacher!

843
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,280
good

844
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,160
Sir, it's really decent.

845
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,240
An upright standard-bearer of Chinese studies

846
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
Then let's do it now.

847
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,800
You send a telegram to recover the novel.

848
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm writing to hurt Cai Yuanpei.

849
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,200
be

850
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560
No, I have to find this Old Master Q.

851
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,320
Di-t

852
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,640
Angry? Forget it

853
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,760
fault

854
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,160
What does Old Master Q think of you?

855
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,520
Writing novels and writing letters are all scolding Cai 

856
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,400
But if it is necessary to delete Jane, it will be complicated and far-reaching. 

857
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,280
Di-t

858
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,120
You are a politician.

859
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,600
Won't go to the mind of Ramo literati.

860
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,960
Writing novels is innuendo.

861
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,560
That's swearing at the corner.

862
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
Writing a letter is different.

863
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,960
That's an open and clear position.

864
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
That's what Old Master Q wants.

865
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Boy, you don't really send telegrams.

866
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
Get the novel back.

867
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,560
Want to take back the spilled water.

868
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,240
Isn't it crazy?

869
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,320
If Old Master Q takes this matter 

870
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,520
Tell Cai Yuanpei

871
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,840
What will you do if you confront each other in the future?

872
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,400
A bet

873
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,960
I will also write a letter to Cai Yuanpei tomorrow. 

874
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
Tell him that "Demon Dream" has

875
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,520
Not coming back.

876
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,200
I'll give him some more eye drops.

877
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Not afraid of his disagreement with Old Master Q. 

878
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
Pinch it up with a real knife

879
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,760
Damaged enough

880
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,920
I had to.

881
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,560
That's it.

882
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,840
Comrade Liu Mei

883
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
What's going on in this article?

884
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,000
You make it clear to everyone.

885
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
I don't know what happened to this article.

886
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
I don't know Shenzhou Daily.

887
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,200
I don't know this Half Valley Newsletter either.

888
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
I don't know who wrote this article.

889
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,280
Comrade arch eyebrows, sit down first.

890
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,680
Nothing. Sit down.

891
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,880
Comrades

892
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,160
Now, not blindly.

893
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
When blaming Comrade Liu Mei

894
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,040
The most important thing now

895
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,240
It's to find out who's behind this.

896
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
I think this is a chat.

897
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,360
That's the reporter named trampling on people.

898
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,920
Yes, our enemy is not arch eyebrows.

899
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,120
It's this trampling.

900
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,440
fault

901
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,200
When did he become our enemy?

902
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,800
I don't think it's him

903
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,880
Think about it. He came to help us. 

904
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,120
How can you write such an article? 

905
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,160
Yes

906
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,440
Yes

907
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,800
People are here to help us. 

908
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,080
I don't think he is either.

909
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,680
alright

910
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,280
Let's not discuss it. 

911
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,120
He Mengxiong, tell me your reasons.

912
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,600
This tramp talked to us twice. 

913
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,960
Give me a bad impression.

914
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,560
He doesn't feel like a good person.

915
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,840
Two interviews

916
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,600
He doesn't care what we say.

917
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,520
Just stare at what you are interested in and ask.

918
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,520
Especially prolong arch eyebrows.

919
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,960
Group of personal problems first

920
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,160
He clung to it.

921
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,600
I think his motive is not pure.

922
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
I believe my feelings.

923
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,560
This man is insidious.

924
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,120
Second, the author of this article

925
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,480
To the members of our mutual aid society

926
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,480
Family background and experience are particularly familiar.

927
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,920
Look, he said

928
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
The Communist Mutual Aid Society consists of a group of

929
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,880
Educated by Chen Duxiu's new culture thought

930
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,160
Extreme youth composition

931
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
Except Chen Duxiu's two sons.

932
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,800
Is the initiator.

933
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,400
And for advocating the abolition of filial piety. 

934
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,480
And heretics expelled from school

935
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,720
There are runaway and eloped women.

936
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,280
There are violent elements who specifically oppose the government.

937
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,400
etc

938
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,400
If I remember correctly

939
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,760
These situations

940
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
That's the reporter named trampling on people.

941
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,600
What I am most interested in during the interview

942
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,680
He interviewed me twice in private.

943
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,760
But what I said to him

944
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,680
It is not reflected in this article.

945
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
What he cares about is not your opinion.

946
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,000
It's about fanning the canon

947
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,360
Run our mutual aid society.

948
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,880
Prepositions ruin new culture.

949
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,920
Then we are in danger now. 

950
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,360
Three working groups are struggling to operate.

951
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,560
No customers in the canteen.

952
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,000
The laundry team can't attract guests either.

953
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,920
At present, only movies can barely make a loss. 

954
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,760
Now this is happening.

955
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,360
Overturned the social canon that originally supported us.

956
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,640
We can't sit back and wait.

957
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
We have to dig out the man behind this.

958
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,080
I disagree with you.

959
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
I think this article is not a bad thing.

960
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,080
Someone attacked us. 

961
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,080
Actually, they are advertising for us for free.

962
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
You should thank him.

963
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,480
I think so too
