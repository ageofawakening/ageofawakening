00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:05,550
[Episode Twenty-two]

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
Hey, don't worry.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,520
If there is any cost

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,160
You guys

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,360
just come to me

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,960
(Mao Zedong)

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,400
What he just said

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,600
Do you understand ?

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,480
Yes!

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,360
We

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,800
can just go to school without worries about fees

13
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,640
If someone asks us for tuition fees,

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
we can just come to Mao Zedong

15
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,760
Yes! Yes!

16
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,320
Great!

17
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,760
Let all the people in our gardening room

18
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,360
go to school !

19
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,080
Terrific!

20
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,000
Uncle Wang

21
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,040
What a  wonderful thing it is

22
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,560
to live and learn!

23
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,400
Don't run away.

24
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,560
I've made the second lap around Peking University to chase after you.

25
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,280
Can you stop and listen to me for a moment?

26
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Is this stepping? Cairen? (In Chinese, Cairen means stepping on people)

27
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
Why do you have such a name, Mr Zhang?

28
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,840
Too funny.

29
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,040
This is my pen name.

30
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,040
But it is more famous than my real name.

31
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,480
Just call me Cairen

32
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:50,880
OK!

33
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,760
You can all call me Cairen.

34
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
Okay. Nice to meet you, Cairen!

35
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,480
Hello, hello, hello.

36
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,520
Here we are, right here.

37
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,640
Follow me!

38
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey, what's wrong?

39
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,000
Miss Liu

40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,960
There is one thing I want to explain to you.

41
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,920
You say

42
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,960
My identity as a journalist

43
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,800
It has never been exposed in Peking University.

44
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,480
So I can't interview students from Peking University.

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,080
Please understand me.

46
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,680
Understand

47
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,760
Among the four people we interviewed today

48
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,880
There are no students from Peking University.

49
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,160
So you don't have to worry.

50
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,360
You don't have to meet them either.

51
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,080
don't worry

52
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,480
let's go!

53
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,280
Here, let me help you.

54
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,760
I got it, I got it, I got it.

55
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,200
thank you

56
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,240
This is the girls' dormitory

57
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,160
Comrades are waiting for you inside.

58
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,040
come

59
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,680
Let me introduce it to you.

60
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,720
And this

61
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,160
is the reporter of the column "Stories in Academic Community"

62
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
Cairen

63
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,240
hello

64
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,680
welcome

65
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,200
thank you

66
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Step on people?

67
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,960
The name sounds

68
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
like a little bully?

69
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,000
This comrade

70
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,040
Have you ever been to school and read newspapers?

71
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,080
Yes!

72
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm auditting in the Women's Normal University now.

73
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,960
And I read  newspapers every day

74
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
Now that you are a

75
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,760
college student who read newspapers every day

76
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,160
Why haven't you even heard of Cairen?

77
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,480
Please forgive her, bro

78
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
Comrade Yi.

79
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,600
She was outspoken and meant no harm.

80
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
Please don't care.

81
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,000
it doesn't matter

82
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,240
I just think your name is a little strange

83
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,360
Can't hold back for a moment.

84
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,160
Sorry

85
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,280
It's okay, it's okay.

86
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
Then let's get started.

87
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,240
Come on, let's go, let's go

88
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,440
Sit down, sit down.

89
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
Come and try it.

90
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,640
Thank you, thank you

91
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,440
try it

92
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:33,760
you are welcome

93
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,080
Try

94
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:34,720
this

95
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
You're welcome. You're welcome

96
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,880
You eat and come, too

97
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
You eat too, you eat too.

98
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,480
thank you

99
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,880
Come and eat. You eat, too.

100
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,680
good

101
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
This comrade is very interesting

102
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,720
Take garlic as a snack

103
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,320
I have a toothache

104
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,720
Toothache is good

105
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh, sorry, garlic is  good.

106
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,680
Disinfection

107
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,960
Then I'll tell you about our work-study mutual aid society.

108
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,920
Let me introduce it to you.

109
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,280
No introduction is necessary.

110
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
I have another interview in the Congress.

111
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Just pick out the important information.

112
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,680
Let's do it this way:

113
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
Miss Liu, please tell me

114
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,400
your family backgrounds

115
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
motivation and education background first.

116
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,880
Isn't that still an introduction?

117
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,560
Comrade Yi

118
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Miss Liu, let's start with you

119
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,680
OK.

120
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,720
Get him a cup of water

121
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,320
I am a student learning French

122
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
in Shanghai Aurora School.

123
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
And there's nothing special about my family background.

124
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,960
There is also no special reason

125
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,960
to join the society.

126
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,640
Just feel fresh.

127
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
It can't be true

128
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Impossible to have no background.

129
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Mr. Kicker, there is a cup of water for you.

130
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
Excuse me.

131
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,760
My name is Cairen, not Kicker.

132
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,920
Oh! Stepper, you can drink your water.

133
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,680
HHHH, drink water.

134
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,920
She is too humiliated to tell you the truth.

135
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,040
I'll tell you.

136
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,200
Her father is Liu Wenyao, a tycoon in Shanghai.

137
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Miss Liu, you are too modest.

138
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
Then Miss Yi, who is your father?

139
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
Yi Manlong. Do you know him?

140
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Congressman Yi Manlong?

141
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,520
Who doesn't know him?

142
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,480
You come here for fun too?

143
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:08,960
Almost

144
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,600
She is not.

145
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,160
Ah, she came here to escape from marriage.

146
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,040
You!

147
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,840
This can't be written in the article.

148
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,280
If this is seen by my dad,

149
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,800
he will kill me.

150
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
I think this is a good news point.

151
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,600
Don't write, don't write.

152
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,280
I'll tell you a bigger news

153
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,920
What news?

154
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,400
Do you know who Liu Mei's boyfriend is?

155
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,520
who

156
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,240
He is the eldest son of the famous Chen Duxiu.

157
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
Chen Yannian

158
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
The truth is not what she said.

159
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,240
We are just comrades.

160
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
Chen Yannian also joined this work-study mutual aid society?

161
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
Good thing. Great

162
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,640
I must write about you well.

163
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
I want to know

164
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,840
whether or not all the work of your mutual aid society

165
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,760
is arranged by Chen Yannian?

166
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,480
yes

167
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,480
Good

168
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:44,800


169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:44,880


170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Opium poisoning is not shallow.

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Since it is transported to China one hundred years ago.

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
It has burried countless heros.

173
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
At the same time, people spend countless money on it. How painful!

174
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,400
thank you

175
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
Smoking is strictly prohibited. But it's like a joke.

176
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,760
Now public sale will appear.

177
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,080
It's a trifle to be laughed at by outsiders.

178
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,160
How can I hurt my compatriots?

179
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,440
Come to the movies.

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,200
Domestic film "Black Ghost"

181
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
Inside please

182
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,520
Watch a movie.

183
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,000
How is it going

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,640
How are the tickets selling?

185
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,440
Can we start the screening?

186
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,200
Almost done. We have sold more than 200 tickets.

187
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,160
Great

188
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
You have been a great help to us.

189
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
When the movie is over.

190
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,560
We'll treat you to a midnight snack.

191
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Comrade Yu Xiusong

192
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
Even your pants are communist.

193
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800
With what can you treat people to night snack?

194
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,080
Comrade Yi Qunxian

195
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
Why are you still talking about pants?

196
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,080
alright

197
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,600
When the movie is over,

198
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
I'll treat you to dinner. Alright?

199
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,160
thank you

200
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,720
thank you

201
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,080
You are not allowed to eat.

202
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,360
It's not your treat.

203
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
It's none of your business, OK? You!

204
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Yu Xiusong

205
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
Why can't the film hang up?

206
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,760
Come and have a look.

207
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,480
Okay, I'll be right there.

208
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,080
Hello, do you still have movie tickets?

209
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,880
Yes, yes, it will start soon.

210
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,040
How many?

211
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,120


212
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,360
How many?

213
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:53,840
Two.

214
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Two tickets, please

215
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,840
Take this.

216
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,640
Watch a movie.

217
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,440
This way, please. This way, please

218
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Watch a movie, watch a movie.

219
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,400
Black ghost

220
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,360
It's about to start.

221
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,400
Domestic film

222
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
You're dressed in rags.

223
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
What's going to happen again?

224
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Uncle, I have a big harvest

225
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,520
I finally found Chen Duxiu's weakness.

226
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
What kind of weakness?

227
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
His two sons

228
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,200
What do you mean?

229
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
They are running a work-study mutual aid society.

230
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,240
where they share their wealth and even wife

231
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Let's go see Master Lin.

232
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,480
OK

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Master, Councillor Zhang is here.

234
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,560
What can I do for you at this late hour?

235
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
please

236
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
My kind and respected teacher

237
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,360
My nephew Xiaofeng has two things to report to you.

238
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,480
Go ahead

239
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,640
First, sir

240
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,560
Sir, those two novels

241
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,840
I've arranged it.

242
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,680
Jingsheng will be published next week

243
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
on Shanghai New Declaration

244
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
"Demon Dream" will be published later.

245
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
Very good

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
As soon as these two novels are published

247
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
I can stop my anger.

248
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,880
In this way

249
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,240
The days of Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi

250
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
and Qian Xuantong

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
will become hard.

252
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,720
Come and sit.

253
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
Sir, the second thing is

254
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,760
I've learned that

255
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,840
Chen Duxiu instigated his two sons

256
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
to organize a work-study mutual aid society in Beijing.

257
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,400
where a dozen young men and women

258
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
Implement anarchic communism.

259
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
These people live in groups.

260
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,840
Propagandize the fallacies of the West.

261
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,840
Destroy the government and be hostile to the family

262
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
and practice communist and share their wives

263
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
It not only disturbs the society, but also corrupts public morals.

264
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
which has aroused the public anger.

265
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
There are such things?

266
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
Who are these people?

267
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
Most of them are people around Peking University.

268
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,640
There's one more thing.

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
Cai Yuanpei, Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao

270
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,640
Fan some students

271
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
A lecture group on civilian education is being organized

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,040
They planned to broadcast their new culture

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,280
in streets, factories and hutongs.

274
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
And I heard.

275
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
I heard that you

276
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,840
are the live boots they'll attack.

277
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,400
Wolf's ambition. Damn it.

278
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,840
Don't worry.

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,040
Teacher, we are stepping up the collection of evidence.

280
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
to officially impeach Cai Yuanpei

281
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
and expel Chen Duxiu  on Congress.

282
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Zhang Changli

283
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
You let me down.

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
You've said this a million times.

285
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Now Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei

286
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
They  not only plan to overthrow our national religion

287
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
But also practice the inhuman communist life

288
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,080
wich will lose all our traditional virtues

289
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,640
As a congressman,

290
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,920
Where are your duties and beliefs?

291
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,200
Zhang Changli

292
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,840
Can you tell me the truth?

293
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,400
Did you have a solution or not?

294
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,080


295
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,560
I have solutions. This time I really have a solution.

296
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
I used to fight by myself.

297
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
But I have a partner this time.

298
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
Congressman Yi Long's daughter

299
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
also joined the work-study mutual aid society.

300
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
We can make advantage of him.

301
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
Well, give me a definite word.

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
When will the motion of expelling Chen and Cai be submitted?

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
My teacher, don't worry.

304
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,520
My teacher, now Paris is holding the  Peace Conference.

305
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Xu Shichang asked Wu Bingxiang to strengthen the security of the capital

306
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
to prevent students from making trouble.

307
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,880
Xu also ordered the Ministry of Education to restore the university discipline.

308
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,560
This is the right time.

309
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll find Yi Long.

310
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
and try to submit the bill next week.

311
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,880
There's no try to do. You have to make it.

312
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, sir.

313
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Words count or not?

314
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
Count, count

315
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,760
Okay, this time, we must expell

316
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Chen Duxiu, the demon from Beijing.

317
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,080
Yes!

318
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,520
Please!

319
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
What did you say?

320
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
My daughter has done some foul and evil things?

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
What's going on? Tell me.

322
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
How dare I cheat you?

323
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,200
Members of the mutual aid society

324
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
are not only preaching heresies everywhere,

325
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,760
slandering the government

326
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
but also living in groups to practice Communist hetaerism.

327
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
Even forcing members who joined the club

328
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,600
to cut off from their families

329
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,920
which has aroused public anger.

330
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,640
People all denounce them.

331
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
Outrageous!

332
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
Outrageous!

333
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
I'll take her back now.

334
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Wait! Wait!

335
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
Brother Yi, please sit down.

336
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
Sit down.

337
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
Brother Yi

338
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,360
I have another uninvited request.

339
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,040
Go ahead.

340
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,560
Yi

341
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,000
Do you know who started the mutual aid society?

342
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,040
who?

343
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Now it is  Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei,

344
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
who are followed and admired by young people

345
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
Your daughter must have been bewitched by them.

346
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,400
and ran away from home and joined the society.

347
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
You can certainly take your daughter home.

348
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
But this is a temporary solution rather than a permanent cure.

349
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,160
As long as we don't bring Cai Chen down

350
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,720
Your daughter can't really get out of danger,

351
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
and return to family

352
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,920
Go ahead, Zhang.

353
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160
What do I need to do?

354
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,080
Please help me.

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,400
You can submit to Congress

356
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,880
a proposal of removing Chen and Cai from the office

357
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,520
so that we can save thousands of students from the danger!

358
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,040
Zhang, I'll do as you said.

359
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Thanks

360
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,080
President, Cai Yuanpei has arrived.

361
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,360
The president is really in a state of affairs

362
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,280


363
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,520
Mr. Cai

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
The president is calling you.

365
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
You Cai Zimin(another name of Cai Yuanpei)

366
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,680
makes me live ten years shorter.

367
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
Oh? President,

368
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
Who made you so angry?

369
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,800
You called me here.

370
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
to listen to your complain? I don't believe that.

371
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,480
Well, since you called me the president,

372
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,600
I will admonish you and Peking University

373
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,680
as the president of the Republic of China.

374
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,040
please

375
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
I'm all ears

376
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
President Cai Yuanpei, you should bear in mind what I'm going to say:

377
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,280
Now the Republic of China is in an extraordinary period.

378
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,560
This is the first time we won a war

379
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
in the past decades,

380
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,240
and become a victorious country.

381
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,480
Our country's representatives are attending the peace conference in Paris,

382
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,600
which

383
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,920
concerns the fundamental interests of the Republic of China.

384
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,200
You, President Cai, should earnestly fulfill your responsibilities.

385
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,960
Manage your school well.

386
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,040
Your students and teachers at school

387
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,480
don't rock the boat and ruin the overall situation.

388
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,280
President, you made me confused.

389
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,360
Excuse me, how did Peking University rock the boat

390
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,720
and ruin the overall situation?

391
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,920
Okay, okay, okay.

392
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,880
good

393
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
Look

394
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,000
Look

395
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,040
These bills

396
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,280
They all accuse you of Cai Yuanpei and Peking University.

397
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,880
Look at them!

398
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,640
Look at this.

399
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,320
This is from Ma Qiyong, president of Confucius Church.

400
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,680
He accused you of forgetting ancestors, subvertting moral codes

401
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
and losing human relations

402
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,880
I'll show you more.

403
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,280
Look at this.

404
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,480
President, Duan Qirui has arrived.

405
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,200
He wanted to discuss with you as soon as possible.

406
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
I'll be right there. You just play it by ear.

407
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,280
Chairman, Cai is here.

408
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,560
Let him in.

409
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
Brother Cai

410
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480
The decision-making body is unpresentable

411
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,480
It works secretly. (Cai played jokes on him)

412
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,600
What decision-making body?

413
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,960
I'll do it

414
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm ears of the deaf. Decoration.

415
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,440
I can see that there are great difficulties.

416
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,640
You are also full of complaints.

417
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,840
Stop talking about me.

418
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,240
Why are you coming here? What can I do for you?

419
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
Early in the morning, I was called by President Xu

420
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
to his office.

421
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,400
I queued up at the gate of president palace

422
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
for an hour.

423
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
After entering his office,

424
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,720
President Xu scolded me for half an hour again.

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,400
What did he scold you for?

426
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
He blamed me for advocating the new culture.

427
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,200
Now Peking University has become an eventful place.

428
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
He asked me to pull back from the brink.

429
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,440
for it was a sensitive time during the Paris Peace Conference.

430
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,800
He said that I have to control myself.

431
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
manage students and teachers well.

432
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,840
Don't rock the boat and ruin the overall situation.

433
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,760
thank you

434
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
He has a guilty conscience.

435
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,880
Brother, I don't understand.

436
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,160
The Paris Peace Conference should be a grand meeting of victorious countries.

437
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,760
We went there to enjoy the fruits of the victorious country.

438
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,320
How is it a sensitive period?

439
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,600
Cai, you are so naive.

440
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
Do you still think we are a victorious country?

441
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,320
I don't understand.

442
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,880
So I came here to ask you.

443
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,640
What do you want to know?

444
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,280
The internal and international affairs. The more detailed, the better.

445
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,720
Internal affairs are not my job.

446
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,080
As for diplomacy,

447
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
we are in trouble.

448
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
China is trapped on the crater.

449
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,960
Maybe something serious will happen someday.

450
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
What? We are ignored in Paris?

451
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,920
Worse.

452
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,480
No countries care about us!

453
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,600
It seems that Paris Peace Conference a grand meeting of victorious countries.

454
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,280
But actually,

455
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,320
It is a meeting of just four countries: America, Britain, France and Italy.

456
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
Italy is ignored.

457
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,600
Decisions are actually made by American President Wilson,

458
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
British Prime Minister Lloyd George

459
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
and French Prime Minister Clemenceau.

460
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,440
According to regulations

461
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
Only when it comes to China's interests,

462
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
We can send two representatives to attend.

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
It's been more than ten days.

464
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
But we didn't even get a chance to attend the meeting.

465
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
A weak country has no diplomacy. I understand that.

466
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,160
What I care about is

467
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,800
this time

468
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,360
can we get the Shandong Peninsula back?

469
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,360
That depends on the attitude of the Japanese.

470
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,400
At present, the outlook is not optimistic.

471
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,080
What's wrong?

472
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,080
Liang Shizhi, Cao Rulin and other pro-Japanese factions

473
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
disapprove of China's unified railway management case.

474
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,760
Japanese envoy Xiao Panna

475
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
also lodged a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

476
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,720
This is a signal.

477
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,640
What about American president Wilson's attitude?

478
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
He has been high-profile at first

479
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,120
and kept the Chinese affairs in suspense.

480
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,400
But now, he kept siilence suddently.

481
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,800
That's an ominous sign.

482
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
I've been in Paris for more ten days.

483
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,400
Heads of state of the United States, Britain, France and Italy

484
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,680
I havn't seen any of them.

485
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,920
Wang Daxie and Lin Changmin in China

486
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,440
asks me about my progress by telegram every day.

487
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,840
I don't have a chance to hand in my proposal because I don't see the heads.

488
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,280
Where's the progress?

489
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,200
Guangzhou military government sent me to Paris.

490
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,640
I've thought it was a crushy job.

491
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
I didn't expect to be so timid.

492
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
How can you regard this as a glories job? Foul!

493
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,640
I've told you it was a chore!

494
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,440
Maybe.

495
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,360
We will end up with a notorioud reputation in histry.

496
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,080
We have to   prepare for this.

497
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,200
Chief,

498
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,400
Outside Chinese delegation's residence

499
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,600
came many Chinese who live France.

500
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,640
They asked to see you.

501
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
I won't meeet them. Just say I'm with the English people.

502
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
Dozens of people come here every day.

503
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
They bring countless posts and parcels.

504
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,280
We don't have enough room to store them.

505
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,560
What do they want to do?

506
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,480
What do they want to do?

507
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,160
They just have one appeal:

508
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,880
Beside the seven requirements, they ask the Chinese delegation to add one terms

509
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
of cancelling the clause of Article 21.

510
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
You can tell them clearly.

511
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
With the permission of the government,

512
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,560
we have formally proposed to the Peace Conference

513
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,160
that Article 21 should be abolished.

514
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,840
But they want to see the results now.

515
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,920
The result has to be waited.

516
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,160
We have been begging the four heads of state every day

517
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,520
for a favor.

518
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
What Wilson said is in favor of us.

519
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,600
But he doesn't shows up.

520
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,800
What's going on?

521
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,000
Shaochuan

522
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
My body

523
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,920
is really overwhelmed.

524
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
I have to go to Switzerland to see a doctor

525
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
Shaochuan, I'll leave it to you.

526
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,880
Rutang

527
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,760
Shaochuan(Gu Weijun's another name) knows more about diplomacy than you do.

528
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
Please be more tolerant.

529
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,600
National affairs are of great importance.

530
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,680
Don't worry, I don't care about ranking.

531
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,200
good

532
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,160
Then, please.

533
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,280
We are all Chinese.

534
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,400
We know what weighs more.

535
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,480
Good, I agree with you.

536
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,560
We encourage each other.

537
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,640
Come in, please.

538
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
Sir, this is from Congress.

539
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
It is said that the Senate will hold an inquiry meeting next week.

540
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,560
Ask questions about Peking University.

541
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,640
They ask you and Chen Duxiu to attend the meeting.

542
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,920
What is Congress going to ask us about Peking University?

543
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,360
I heard that there's a joint proposal to dismiss you from Peking University.

544
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,400
sir

545
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,520
Your shoes.

546
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,800
Hang it all!

547
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
Hang it all!

548
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,920
The capital is the best place.

549
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
In order to maintain the security of the capital,

550
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,560
during the Paris Peace Conference

551
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,280
Students are forbidden to carry banners, slogans and flags

552
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,280
and go out in droves

553
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,440
Do not stay in public places for a long time.

554
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
No assembly. No speech.

555
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,280
Excuse me. Excuse me

556
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,480
Sell newspapers, sell newspapers, sell newspapers

557
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
Lin Lu, a master of Chinese studies, wrote the novel Jingsheng.

558
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,160
He accused Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu of betraying our culture.

559
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Sell newspapers

560
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
Newsboy, newsboy, please.

561
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,120
I got good luck today.

562
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,800
Someone sent us newspapers for free.

563
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,560
He also said there would be rewards for good sales.

564
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
Sell newspapers

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,480
Hey neesboy!

566
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,480
Let me see.

567
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
Read the newly published Shenzhou Daily.

568
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,680
New Youth is obsessed with Western cults.

569
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,560
They organize mutual aid society to implement Communist hetaerism.

570
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,720
Read the newly published Shenzhou Daily.

571
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
New Youth is obsessed with Western cults.

572
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,680
They organize mutual aid societies to implement Communist hetaerism.

573
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
Mr. Lu Xun, there's something wrong.

574
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,080
Mr Lu Xun

575
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520
Here comes your opponent.

576
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Mr. Lin's novel Jingsheng

577
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,320
is much sharper than

578
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,600
your "Diary of a Madman"

579
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,120
Why?

580
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,560
I'll read it to you guys.

581
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,920
Ban Nong, you just read a general idea.

582
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,160
Okay, then listen up.

583
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
This novel Jingsheng

584
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,320
is a story about a hero

585
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
beating up a crazy man.

586
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
It says that

587
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
Jing Sheng, a martial arts expert, stayed at Taoran Pavilion at night.

588
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,640
In the evening, he heard there are Tian Qimei from Anhui province

589
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,480
Jin Xinyi from Zhejiang province

590
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
And Dimo, a philosopher who just came back from America

591
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,440
drinking, having fun, and they are raving next door.

592
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,680
They are attacking writings in classical Chinese and Confucius

593
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,360
The hero Jing Sheng

594
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,800
was furious when he heard it.

595
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,680
He broke into the house and beat up three people.

596
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
Tian Qimei was knocked to the ground.

597
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,680
While he still want to fight back,

598
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,280
Then Jing Shen pressed his head with two fingers.

599
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,240
Then Tian got serious pain like being pricked by a cone.

600
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,760
What's more, he stepped on Di Mo accidently.

601
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Di is about to break because of the pain.

602
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
Jin Xinyi

603
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,120
wears glasses.

604
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,880
His glasses fell to the ground.

605
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,040
Then he kneeled on the ground, koutowing.

606
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,640
His fear of death is like a hedgehog.

607
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,520
Needless to say the result

608
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
It must be a complete defeat of the crazy men.

609
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,920
Jingsheng won a big victory, didn't he?

610
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,280
In my opinion

611
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,280
This Mr. Lin Qinnan is really talented

612
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,200
His writing skills are comparable to Lu Xun's.

613
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,640
I agree.

614
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,320
I can't compete with him.

615
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,480
At most, I use a pen.

616
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,040
Mr. Green

617
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,240
Mr. Lin has already started

618
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
to call Beiyang government

619
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
To suppress you demons!

620
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Do you understand

621
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,240
Who these three crazy men are?

622
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,440
Tian Qimei is Chen Duxiu.

623
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
Jin Xinyi

624
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,960
is Qian Xuantong

625
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,960
De Mo, the philosophy who just came back from America

626
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,280
must be our Hu Shi.

627
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
Now, the three people are real

628
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,920
demons that confuses my ears with the words of animals.

629
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,640
Thanks to Master Lin for giving me surname and putting me among demons.

630
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,280
It's my honor. Hahahaha

631
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Mr. Cai

632
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,600
Mr. Cai

633
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,800
I can't believe you can still laugh?

634
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
Enemies' arrows are all fired towards us.

635
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,120
The latest issue of National Heritage magazine

636
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
I don't know if everyone has seen it.

637
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
Huang Kan, Editor-in-Chief of National Heritage Magazine

638
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
hit Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi by name

639
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,160
He said you two are devils of forgetting ancestors and corrupting the nation's morality.

640
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,680
He described himself of

641
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
a man of lofty ideals who brings order out of chaos and revitalizes governance.

642
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,160
and who saves the young people.

643
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,560
And here are more

644
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,120
boring tabloid like this.

645
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,440
It's full of attacks on Peking University

646
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,560
and our new culture.

647
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,200
Those articles are countless. What a situation!

648
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,000
We are attacked by both the south and north.

649
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,960
ten thousand arrows shoot at once

650
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,920
It's unbearable! It's unbearable!

651
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,080
I'm sure you gentlemen have seen it.

652
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,800
How is the attack? A serious one.

653
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
It's also very big.

654
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,880
But it's much more than that.

655
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
President Xu Shichang called me to his office.

656
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,880
He rebuked me and Peking University.

657
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,160
And the tone and words are very strict.

658
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,560
Congress also issued a notice.

659
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,600
It asked me and brother Zhongfu and others

660
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,360
to go to Congress for the questioning next week.

661
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,200
It really feels like a storm is coming.

662
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,400
So gentlemen, please analyze it.

663
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,080
Mr. Cai

664
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
I still insist that there's no need to analyze.

665
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,760
It's obvious.

666
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,960
At the same time

667
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
South, north, two attacks at the same time

668
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
One alluded in the novel.

669
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,320
One declared war by name.

670
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
And these tabloid rumors are flying.

671
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
Now the Congress and the police department also joined them.

672
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
It was premeditated.

673
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,200
And it's a big deal

674
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
I saw a murderous look.

675
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,480
This time

676
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,040
They not only attack Zhongfu(Chen Duxiu) Shizhi(Hu Shi) Deqian(Qian Xuantong)

677
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
but also pointed the finger at Mr. Cai directly.

678
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,560
I think they're going to have a showdown.

679
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,080
These remarks of theirs

680
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,160
Yes, I have read them all carefully.

681
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,280
There are many

682
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
aiming at our work-study mutual aid society.

683
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,640
the lecture group of civilian education.

684
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,960
Obviously, it has been planned for a long time.

685
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,320
Rome is not build in one day

686
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,360
I think it's time for a decisive battle

687
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,880
between the old and new cultures.

688
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,160
Which one will win? it's time to end the war.

689
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,200
Fight back!

690
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
I can't stand it anymore.

691
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,920
Gentlemen, don't get too excited.

692
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,280
Let's calm down first.

693
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,720
Now that Mr Cai is here.

694
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
Let's listen to what Mr Cai has to say.

695
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
You all know that I insist

696
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,840
that everything should be done step by step.

697
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,040
Don't be violent.

698
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,160
I've always thought that the battle between old and new cultures

699
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,000
is an academic dispute.

700
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
A hundred schools of thought should contend.

701
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,920
Whether old school or new school,

702
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,240
both of us are doing researches

703
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,000
and thinking about possible ways for country.

704
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,320
We should view each other as sworn enemies.

705
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,400
We should not go to the point of life and death.

706
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,040
So I wrote a letter to Mr Lin Qinnan.

707
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,640
Invite him

708
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,160
to write an inscription on Liu Yingqiu's Works in Ming Dynasty,

709
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,960
which means

710
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,160
in private, we are still friends.

711
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,360
Mr. Cai, you are just too kind and tolerant.

712
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,800
Dexian, sit down.

713
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,000
Tolerance and kindness are always Cai Gong's style.

714
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,840
No, no, no.

715
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,040
Tolerance and kindness are our scholars' style

716
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
cultivated from an early age.

717
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,480
But tolerance and kindness

718
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,920
are not unlimited.

719
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
Let's look at this novel by Lin Qinnan.

720
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,720
The whole story is full of rumors. It's merderous.

721
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,160
He won't become happy until he puts us to death.

722
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,680
Let's look at those members of Congress.

723
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
What's that called? Zhang what?

724
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,640
Zhang Changli and Yi Kunlong

725
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,120
What did they write jointly in their letter?

726
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
It is said that there's no hope in our education

727
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,520
unless dismiss Cai Yuanpei from Peking University.

728
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,120
There is no peace in the capital

729
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,040
unless we expel Chen Duxiu from Beijing.

730
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,000
Well, Congress gave a notice

731
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,920
Jingshi Police Department

732
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,240
even posted the notices on the our doors.

733
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,760
President Xu Shichang personally rebuked me.

734
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
Lu Xun is right.

735
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
It's time for decisive battle.

736
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
My new novel "Kong Yiji"

737
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,480
is almost finished.

738
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,800
Sir, I will write another novel.

739
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,400
I must compete with this Lin Qinnan. (and win him)

740
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,560
Well, since everyone agreed to fight back

741
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,880
Even there are thousands of enemies, I will fight!

742
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,560
It doesn't matter whether I goes or stays.

743
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
But I will never tolerate

744
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,560
that they kill our new culture

745
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
which we cultivated little by little

746
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,560
in the cradle. I won't make it happen!

747
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,840
From tomorrow

748
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,680
our four magazines will go into the battle together.

749
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,040
I'm in charge of New Youth.

750
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,320
Shouchang is in charge of Weekly Review

751
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,880
and "The Nation".

752
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,320
Shizhi, you're in charge of New Tide.

753
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,480
Everyone should write articles and show your magic.

754
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,840
We not only use our magazines

755
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,200
but also mobilize our students

756
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,240
to contribute extensively to major newspapers and publications.

757
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
Let's be overwhelming.

758
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,040
Shizhi, Shouchang

759
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
You have appeal among students.

760
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Get your students started.

761
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,680
Let the lecture group go to the street!

762
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,160
They all hit the door.

763
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,920
How can we still be cowardice like turtles?

764
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,040
Zhongfu!

765
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Long live the New Culture Movement!

766
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,160
Long live the New Culture Movement!

767
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,120
Long live!

768
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,120
Teacher, look.

769
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,680
The are a lot of feedbacks

770
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
of your novel Jingsheng

771
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,840
made by media.

772
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
Rave reviews!

773
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,440
I think Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu's good days

774
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,600
will end.

775
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,960
Sir

776
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,800
Foreshadowed by this "Jingsheng",

777
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,280
"Demon Dream" must be even more extraordinary.

778
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm sure that

779
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,720
These two novels of you

780
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,240
will leave in the history of Chinese literature

781
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,840
a colorful chapter!

782
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,880
I agree!

783
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,640
Feizai, you notify the New Declaration

784
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,840
not to publish "Demon Dream".

785
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,800
What?

786
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,920
Why?

787
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,280
What's the matter?

788
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,920
Look at this.

789
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,600
What?

790
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
Cai Yuanpei wrote you a letter?

791
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
He invited you to write an inscriptions on Liu Yingqiu's works

792
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,320
which will be published.

793
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,160
What does this mean?

794
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,960
Zhao Timeng wants to publish the works of Liu Yingqiu in the Ming Dynasty.

795
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,520
He asked Cai Yuanpei to help invite me, Liang Qichao,

796
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,920
Zhang Yan and Yan Fu to write a word or an inscription for it.

797
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,560
Cai Heqing let bygones be bygones

798
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,080
He wrote to me personally and asked for help.

799
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,280
I am moved and shamed by his sincere words.

800
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
Why should you be shame?

801
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
I regard him as a demon.

802
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,080
But he regarded me as a great sage.

803
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,360
Compared with this, how can I feel no shame.

804
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
I have thought over this many times.

805
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,560
And the "Demon Dream"

806
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,360
had a direct attack on Cai Yuanpei.

807
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,360
Let's get it back and not publish it.

808
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,240
Teacher, your heart is too soft.

809
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,920
Maybe Cai Yuanpei is scared

810
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
after reading your novel.

811
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,120
So he came to please you.

812
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,680
Don't be fooled.

813
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,480
I agree.

814
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,960
He shouldn't.

815
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
Cai Yuanpei wrote the letter five days ago.

816
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,560
At that time, Jingsheng had not been published.

817
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,520
Sir

818
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,920
Demon Dream has been printed.

819
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,680
I'm afraid I can't get it back.

820
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
Hurry up and send a telegram to New Declaration.

821
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,640
Make sure they stop.

822
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,600
I'll pay for any loss.

823
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,960
Sir, think twice.

824
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,360
Sir

825
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
The penalty plus compensation

826
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
will cost you a lot!

827
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,600
Money is small, personality is big.

828
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,160
Although I'm old,

829
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,600
I can't bear the blame of returning good for evil.

830
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
Please forgive disciple bluntly.

831
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,160
You are too gullible.

832
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
and too easy to compromise

833
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,600
Finally, we're going to win the battle against new culture

834
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,960
with the help of the government.

835
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,080
How can you give up so easily?

836
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,200
I'm not compromising.

837
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,880
I can hold back my novel.

838
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,400
But my cultural position will never change.

839
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,160
I will write an open letter to Cai Yuanpei.

840
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,320
to denounce him conniving Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi and others.

841
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,600
I will firmly defend the orthodox position of Tongcheng School.

842
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,400
Teacher!

843
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,280
Good!

844
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,160
Sir, you're a real decent

845
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,240
and upright standard-bearer of Chinese studies.

846
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
Then let's do it now.

847
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,800
You send a telegram to recover the novel.

848
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm writing to denounce Cai Yuanpei.

849
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,200
OK

850
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560
No, I have to find this Old Master.

851
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,320
Uncle

852
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,640
He is angry now. Forget it

853
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,760
emmm

854
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,160
What does he think of  on earth?

855
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,520
Writing novels and writing letters are all scolding Cai

856
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,400
Why doesn't he choose a easier way(publishing his novel)?

857
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,280
Uncle!

858
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,120
You are a politician.

859
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,600
You don't go to the mind of literatus.

860
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,960
Writing novels is innuendo.

861
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,560
That's swearing at the corner.

862
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
Writing a letter is different.

863
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,960
That's an open and clear position.

864
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
That's what Old Master wants.

865
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Boy, will you really send telegrams

866
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
to get the novel back?

867
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,560
It's impossibe and crazy

868
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,240
to take back the spilled water.

869
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,320
If Old Master

870
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,520
tells it to Cai Yuanpei

871
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,840
What will you do if you confront each other in the future?

872
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,400
Let's take a bet!

873
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,960
I will also write a letter to Cai Yuanpei tomorrow.

874
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
I'll tell him that "Demon Dream"

875
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,520
couldn't be taken back.

876
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,200
I'll give him some more eye drops. ( I'm going to sow discords between Cai and Lin.)

877
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Then there's big possibility that Cai and Lin

878
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
attack each other angrily.

879
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,760
You!

880
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,920
I have no other choice.

881
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,560
I have to do this.

882
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,840
Comrade Liu Mei

883
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
What's going on in this article?

884
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,000
You have to explain!

885
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
I don't know what happened to this article.

886
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
I don't know Shenzhou Daily.

887
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,200
I don't know this Half Valley Newsletter either.

888
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
I don't know who wrote this article.

889
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,280
Comrade Liu Mei, sit down first.

890
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,680
It's OK. Sit down.

891
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,880
Comrades

892
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,160
Now, it's not time that

893
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
we blame Comrade Liu Mei blindly.

894
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,040
The most important thing now

895
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,240
is to find out who did this.

896
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
I think the so-called Liao Zhi.

897
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,360
is the reporter named Cairen.

898
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,920
Yes, our enemy is not Liu Mei,

899
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,120
but Cairen

900
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,440
What?

901
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,200
When did he become our enemy?

902
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,800
I don't think it's him

903
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,880
Think about it. He came to help us.

904
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,120
How can he write such an article?

905
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,160
Yes

906
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,440
Yes

907
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,800
He was here to help us.

908
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,080
I don't think it's him either.

909
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Alright

910
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,280
Stop discussing.

911
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,120
He Mengxiong, tell us why you think so.

912
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,600
Cairen talked to us twice.

913
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,960
He left me a bad impression.

914
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,560
I can feel he isn't a good person.

915
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,840
In thetTwo interviews,

916
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,600
he doesn't care what we say at all.

917
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,520
He just asked about what he was interested about.

918
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,520
Private questions about Liu Mei ,Yannian

919
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,960
and Qunxian

920
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,160
He clung to them.

921
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,600
I don't think his motive is pure.

922
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
I believe my feelings.

923
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,560
This man is insidious.

924
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,120
Second, the author of this article

925
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,480
is especially familiar with

926
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,480
the family backgrounds and experiences of our members.

927
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,920
Look, he said

928
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
the Communist Mutual Aid Society consisted of a group of

929
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,880
extreme young people inflenced by

930
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,160
Chen Duxiu's New Culture

931
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
Besides Chen Duxiu's two sons,

932
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,800
the initiators include heretics

933
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,400
 who were expelled from school

934
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,480
for advocating the abolition of filial piety.

935
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,720
There are also runaway and eloped women.

936
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,280
There are also violent people who specifically oppose the government.

937
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,400
etc

938
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,400
If I remember correctly

939
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,760
these things

940
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
are the most interested part of the reporter named Cairen

941
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,600
in our interview.

942
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,680
He interviewed me twice in private.

943
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,760
But what I said to him

944
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,680
is not reflected in this article.

945
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
What he cares about is not your opinion.

946
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,000
He wanted to guide the public

947
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,360
to destroy our mutual aid society

948
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,880
and ruin new culture.

949
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,920
Then we are in danger now.

950
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,360
Three working groups are struggling to operate.

951
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,560
No customers in our canteen.

952
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,000
The laundry team can't attract guests either.

953
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,920
At present, only movies can barely make both ends meet.

954
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,760
What's more, this article

955
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,360
overturned the public opinion that originally supported us.

956
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,640
We can't sit back and wait.

957
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
We have to dig out the man behind this.

958
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,080
I disagree with you.

959
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
I don't think this article is a bad thing.

960
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,080
The fact that someone attacked us

961
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,080
is actually advertising for us for free.

962
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
You should thank him.

963
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,480
I think so too.
