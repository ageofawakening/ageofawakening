00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,560
we'll treat you to a midnight snack.

192
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Comrade Yu Xiusong,

193
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
even your pants are communist.

194
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800
With what can you treat people to night snack?

195
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,080
Comrade Yi Qunxian,

196
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
why are you still talking about pants?

197
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,080
Alright.

198
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,600
When the movie is over,

199
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
I'll treat you to dinner. Alright?

200
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,160
Thank you.

201
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,720
Thank you.

202
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,080
You are not allowed to eat.

203
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,360
It's not your treat.

204
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
It's none of your business, OK? You!

205
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Yu Xiusong,

206
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
why can't the film hang up?

207
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,760
Come and have a look.

208
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,480
Okay, I'll be right there.

209
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,080
Hello, do you still have movie tickets?

210
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,880
Yes, yes, it will start soon.

211
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,360
How many?

212
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:53,840
Two.

213
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Two tickets, please.

214
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,840
Take this.

215
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,640
Watch a movie.

216
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,440
This way, please. This way, please.

217
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Watch a movie, watch a movie.

218
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,400
"Black Ghost"

219
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,360
It's about to start.

220
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,400
A domestic film.

221
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
You're dressed in rags.

222
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
What's going to happen again?

223
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Uncle, I have big news.

224
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,520
I finally found Chen Duxiu's weakness.

225
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
What kind of weakness?

226
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
His two sons.

227
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,200
What do you mean?

228
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
They are running a work-study mutual aid society

229
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,240
where they share their wealth and even wife.

230
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Let's go see Master Lin.

231
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,480
OK

232
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Master, Councillor Zhang is here.

233
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,560
What can I do for you at this late hour?

234
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
Please.

235
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
My kind and respected teacher.

236
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,360
My nephew Xiaofeng has two things to report to you.

237
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,480
Go ahead.

238
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,640
First, sir.

239
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,560
Sir, those two novels.

240
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,840
I've arranged them.

241
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,680
"Jingsheng" will be published next week

242
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
on Shanghai's "New Morning Post".

243
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
"Demon Dream" will be published later.

244
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
Very good.

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
As soon as these two novels are published,

246
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
I can stop my anger.

247
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,880
In this way,

248
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,240
the days of Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi

249
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
and Qian Xuantong

250
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
will become hard.

251
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,720
Come and sit.

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
Sir, the second thing is

253
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,760
I've learned that

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,840
Chen Duxiu instigated his two sons

255
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
to organize a work-study mutual aid society in Beijing

256
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,400
where a dozen young men and women

257
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
implement anarcho-communism.

258
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
These people live in groups,

259
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,840
propagandize the fallacies of the West,

260
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,840
destroy the government, are hostile to the family,

261
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
practice communism, and share their wives.

262
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
It not only disturbs the society, but also corrupts public morals.

263
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
which has aroused the public anger.

264
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
There are such things?

265
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
Who are these people?

266
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
Most of them are people around Peking University.

267
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,640
There's one more thing.

268
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
Cai Yuanpei, Chen Duxiu Li Dazhao, and others

269
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,640
stirred some students

270
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
to organise a lecture group on civilian education.

271
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,040
They planned to broadcast their New Culture

272
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,280
in streets, factories and hutongs.

273
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
And I heard,

274
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
I heard that you

275
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,840
are the live boots they'll attack.

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,400
A wolf in sheep's clothing. Damn it.

277
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,840
Don't worry.

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,040
Teacher, we are stepping up the collection of evidence.

279
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
to officially impeach Cai Yuanpei

280
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
and expel Chen Duxiu in Congress.

281
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Zhang Changli.

282
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
You let me down.

283
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
You've said this a million times.

284
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Now Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei,

285
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
they not only plan to overthrow our national religion,

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
but also practice the inhuman communist life

287
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,080
which will lose all our traditional virtues

288
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,640
As a congressman,

289
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,920
where are your duties and beliefs?

290
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,200
Zhang Changli.

291
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,840
Can you tell me the truth?

292
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,400
Do you have a solution or not?

293
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:44,377
I do. I do.

294
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,560
This time I really do have a solution.

295
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
I used to fight by myself.

296
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
But this time, I have a partner this time.

297
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
Congressman Yi Kuilong's daughter

298
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
also joined the work-study mutual aid society.

299
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
We can make advantage of him.

300
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
Well, give me a definite word.

301
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
When will the motion of expelling Chen and Cai be submitted?

302
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
My teacher, don't worry.

303
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,520
My teacher, now Paris is holding the Peace Conference.

304
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Xu Shichang asked Wu Bingxiang to strengthen the security of the capital

305
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
to prevent students from making trouble.

306
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,880
Xu also ordered the Ministry of Education to restore the university discipline.

307
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,560
This is the right time.

308
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll find Yi Kuilong.

309
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
and try to submit the bill next week.

310
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,880
There's no try to do. You have to make it.

311
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, sir.

312
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Words count or not?

313
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
They do.

314
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,760
Okay, this time, we must expel

315
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Chen Duxiu, the demon from Beijing.

316
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,080
Yes!

317
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,520
Please!

318
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:48,413
[Yi Kuilong, Congressman]

319
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
What did you say?

320
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
My daughter has done some foul and evil things?

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
What's going on? Tell me.

322
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
How dare I cheat you?

323
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,200
Members of the mutual aid society

324
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
are not only preaching heresies everywhere,

325
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,760
slandering the government

326
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
but also living in groups to practice communist wife-sharing.

327
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
Even forcing members who joined the club

328
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,600
to cut off from their families

329
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,920
which has aroused public anger.

330
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,640
People from all walks of life denounce them.

331
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
Outrageous!

332
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
Outrageous!

333
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
I'll take her back now.

334
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Wait! Wait!

335
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
Brother Yi, please sit down.

336
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
Sit down.

337
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
Brother Yi.

338
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,360
I have another uninvited request.

339
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,040
Go ahead.

340
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,560
Yi.

341
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,000
Do you know who started the mutual aid society?

342
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,040
Who?

343
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Now it is Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei,

344
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
who are followed and admired by young people.

345
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
Your daughter must have been bewitched by them

346
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,400
and ran away from home and joined the society.

347
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
You can certainly take your daughter home.

348
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
But this is a temporary solution rather than a permanent cure.

349
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,160
As long as we don't bring Cai and Chen down

350
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,720
Your daughter can't really get out of danger

351
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
and return to family.

352
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,920
Go ahead, Zhang.

353
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160
What do I need to do?

354
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,080
Please help me.

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,400
You can submit to Congress

356
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,880
a motion to remove Chen and Cai from the office

357
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,520
so that we can save thousands of students from danger!

358
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,040
Zhang, I'll do as you said.

359
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Thanks.

360
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,080
Mr. President, Principal Cai has arrived.

361
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,360
The President is certainly very busy.

362
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,520
Mr. Cai,

363
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
the President is calling you.

364
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,886
[Xu Shichang, pen name Juren, President of the Republic of China]

365
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,281
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

366
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
You, Cai Jiemin,

367
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,680
are making me live ten years shorter.

368
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
Oh? Mr. President,

369
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
who made you so angry?

370
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,800
You called me here

371
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
to listen to your complaint? I don't believe that.

372
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,480
Well, since you called me the President,

373
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,600
I will lecture you and Peking University

374
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,680
as the President of the Republic of China.

375
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,040
Please.

376
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
I'm all ears

377
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
Principal Cai Yuanpei, you should bear in mind what I'm going to say:

378
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,280
now the Republic of China is in an extraordinary period.

379
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,560
This is the first time we won a war

380
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
in decades,

381
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,240
and became a victorious country.

382
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,480
Our country's representatives are attending the peace conference in Paris,

383
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,600
which

384
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,920
concerns the fundamental interests of the Republic of China.

385
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,200
You, Principal Cai, should earnestly fulfill your responsibilities.

386
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,960
Manage your school well.

387
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,040
Your students and teachers at school

388
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,480
are rocking the boat and ruining the overall situation.

389
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Mr. President, you made me confused.

390
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,360
Excuse me, how did Peking University rock the boat

391
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,720
and ruin the overall situation?

392
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,920
Okay, okay, okay.

393
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,880
Okay.

394
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
Look.

395
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,000
Look.

396
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,040
These bills

397
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,280
all accuse you of Cai Yuanpei and Peking University.

398
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,880
Look at them!

399
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,640
Look at this.

400
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,320
This is from Ma Qichang, President of the Confucius Church.

401
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,680
He accused you of forgetting ancestors, subverting moral codes

402
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
and loss of human dignity.

403
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,880
I'll show you more.

404
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,280
Look at this.

405
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,480
Mr. President, Duan Qirui has arrived.

406
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,200
He wanted to discuss with you as soon as possible.

407
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
I'll be right there. You just play it by ear.

408
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,280
Chairman, Mr. Cai is here.

409
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,560
Let him in.

410
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
Brother Jiemin.

411
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480
The decision-making body is unpresentable.

412
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,480
It works secretly.

413
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,600
What decision-making body?

414
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,960
I'll do it.

415
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,000
I have deaf ears. Decoration.

416
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:12,645
[Wang Daxie, styled Botang, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Republic of China]

417
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,440
I can see that there are great difficulties.

418
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,640
You are also full of complaints.

419
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,840
Stop talking about me.

420
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,240
Why are you coming here? What can I do for you?

421
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
Early in the morning, I was called by President Xu

422
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
to his office.

423
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,400
I waited at the gate of president palace

424
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
for an hour.

425
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
After entering his office,

426
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,720
President Xu scolded me for half an hour again.

427
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,400
What did he scold you for?

428
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
He blamed me for advocating the new culture.

429
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,200
Now Peking University has become an eventful place.

430
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
He asked me to pull back from the brink

431
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,440
as it was a sensitive time during the Paris Peace Conference.

432
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,800
He said that I have to control myself,

433
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
manage students and teachers well,

434
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,840
and not rock the boat and ruin the overall situation.

435
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,760
Thank you.

436
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
He has a guilty conscience.

437
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,880
Brother, I don't understand.

438
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,160
The Paris Peace Conference should be a grand meeting of victorious countries.

439
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,760
We went there to enjoy the fruits of the victorious country.

440
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,320
How is it a sensitive period?

441
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,600
Cai, you are so naive.

442
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
Do you still think we are a victorious country?

443
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,320
I don't understand.

444
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,880
So I came here to ask you.

445
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,640
What do you want to know?

446
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,280
The internal and international affairs. The more detailed, the better.

447
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,720
Internal affairs are not my job.

448
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,080
As for diplomacy,

449
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
we are in trouble.

450
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
China is trapped in the crater.

451
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,960
Maybe something serious will happen someday.

452
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
What? We are ignored in Paris?

453
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,920
Worse.

454
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,480
No country cares about us!

455
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,600
It seems that Paris Peace Conference is a grand meeting of victorious countries.

456
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,280
But actually,

457
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,320
it is a meeting of just four countries: America, Britain, France and Italy.

458
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
Italy is ignored.

459
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,600
Decisions are actually made by U.S. President Wilson,

460
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
British Prime Minister Lloyd George

461
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
and French Prime Minister Clemenceau.

462
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,440
According to regulations,

463
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
only when it comes to China's interests,

464
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
We can send two representatives to attend.

465
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
It's been more than ten days.

466
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
But we didn't even get a chance to attend the meeting.

467
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
A weak country has no diplomacy. I understand that.

468
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,160
What I care about is,

469
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,800
this time,

470
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,360
can we get the Shandong Peninsula back?

471
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,360
That depends on the attitude of the Japanese.

472
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,400
At present, the outlook is not optimistic.

473
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,080
What's wrong?

474
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,080

Japanese envoy Xiao Fanna

477
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
also lodged a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

478
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,720
This is a sign.

479
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,640
What about American president Wilson's attitude?

480
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
He has been high-profile at first

481
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,120
and kept the Chinese affairs in suspense.

482
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,400
But now, he suddenly kept silence.

483
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,800
That's an ominous sign.

Where's the progress?

How can you regard this as a glorious job? Foul!

496

I've told you it was a chore!

497
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,440

They just have one appeal:

511
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,880
Beside the seven requirements, they ask the Chinese delegation to add one term

512
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
of cancelling the clause of Article 21.

513
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080

580
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
Mr. Lu Xun, there's something wrong.

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,080
Mr. Lu Xun

582
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520

[Lu Xun, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

585

[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

Okay, then hear this.

This novel "Jingsheng"

593
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,320
is a story of a hero

594
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
beating up a crazy man.

[Gao Yihan, Professor at Peking University]

596
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480

[Liu Bannong, Professor at Peking University]

599
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,640
In the evening, he heard Tian Qimei from Anhui province,

00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,480
Jin Xinyi from Zhejiang province,

601
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
and Di Mo, a philosopher who just came back from America,

602
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,440
drinking, having fun, raving next door.

603
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,680
They attack writings in Classical Chinese and Confucius.

604
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,360
The hero Jingsheng

605
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,800
was furious when he heard it.

606
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,680
He broke into the house and beat up the three people.

607
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
Tian Qimei was knocked to the ground.

608
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,680
While he still want to fight back,

609
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,280
Then Jingsheng pressed his head with two fingers.

610
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,240
Then Tian got in serious pain like being pricked by a cone.

611
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,760
What's more, he stepped on Di Mo accidently.

612
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Di was about to break because of the pain.

613

His glasses fell to the ground.

616
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,040
Then he kneeled on the ground, koutowing.

617
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,640
His fear of death is like a hedgehog.

618
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,520
Needless to say the result

619
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
It must be a complete defeat of the crazy men.

620
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,920
Jingsheng won a big victory, didn't he?

621
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,280
In my opinion,

622
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,280
this Mr. Lin Qinnan is really talented

623
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,200
His writing skills are comparable to Lu Xun's.

624
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,640
I agree.

625
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,320
I can't compete with him.

626
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,480
At most, I use a pen.

627

Mr. Lin Shu,

628
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,240
Mr. Lin has already started

629
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
to call the Beiyang government

630
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
to suppress you demons!

631
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Do you understand

632
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,240
who these three crazy men are?

633
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,440
Tian Qimei is Chen Duxiu.

634

Jin Xinyi

635
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,960
is Qian Xuantong.

636
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,960
Di Mo, the philosopher who just came back from America

637
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,280
must be our Hu Shi.

638
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
Now, the three people are real

639
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,920

640
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,640
Thanks to Master Lin for giving me surname and putting me among demons.

He said you two are devils of forgetting ancestors and corrupting the nation's morality.

651

653

I'm sure you gentlemen have seen it.

665
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,800
How is the attack? A serious one.

666
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
It's also very big.

667
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,880
But it's much more than that.

He rebuked me and Peking University.

670
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,160
And the tone and words are very strict.

671
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,560
Congress also issued a notice.

672

Mr. Cai,

677
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
I still insist that there's no need for discussion.

678
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,760
It's obvious.

679
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,960
It's simulatenous.

680

And these tabloid rumors are flying.

684
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
Now the Congress and the police has also joined them.

685
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
It was premeditated.

686
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,200
And it's a big deal.

687
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
I sense a killing spirit in the air.

688
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,480
This time,

689
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,040
they not only attack Zhongfu, Shizhi, Deqian,

690
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
but also pointed the finger at Mr. Cai directly.

691
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,560
I think they're going to have a showdown.

692
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,080
These remarks of theirs.

693
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,160
Yes, I have read them all carefully.

694
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,280

aiming at our work-study mutual aid society

696

and the lecture group of civilian education.

697
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,960
Obviously, it has been planned for a long time.

698
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,320
It takes time for things to develop into shape.

699
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,360
I think it's time for a decisive battle

700
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,880
between the old and new cultures.

701
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,160
Which one will win? It's time to end the war.

702
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,200
Fight back!

703
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
I can't stand it anymore.

704
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,920
Gentlemen, don't get too excited.

705
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,280
Let's calm down first.

706
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,720
Now that Mr. Cai is here.

707
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
Let's listen to what Mr. Cai has to say.

708
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
You all know that I insist

709
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,840
that everything should be done step-by-step.

710
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,040
Don't be aggressive.

711
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,160
I've always thought that the battle between old and new cultures

712
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,000
is an academic dispute.

713
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
A hundred schools of thought should contend.

714
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,920
Whether old school or new school,

715
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,240
both of us are doing researches

716
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,000
and thinking about possible ways for country.

717
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,320
We should view each other as sworn enemies.

718
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,400
We should not go to the point of life and death.

719
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,040
So I wrote a letter to Mr Lin Qinnan.

720
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,640
Invite him

721
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,160
to write an inscription on Liu Yingqiu's Works in Ming Dynasty,

722
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,960
which means

723
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,160
in private, we are still friends.

724
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,360
Mr. Cai, you are just too kind and tolerant.

725
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,800
Deqian, sit down.

726
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,000
Tolerance and kindness are always Master Cai's style.

727
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,840
No, no.

728
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,040
Tolerance and kindness are our scholars' style

729
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
cultivated from an early age.

730
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,480
But tolerance and kindness

731
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,920
are not unlimited.

732
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
Look at this novel by Lin Qinnan.

733
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,720
The whole story is full of rumors. It's murderous.

734
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,160
He won't become happy until he puts us to death.

735
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,680
Let's look at those members of Congress.

736
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
What's that called? Zhang what?

737
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,640
Zhang Changli and Yi Kunlong.

738
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,120
What did they write jointly in their letter?

739
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
It is said that there's no hope in our education

740
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,520
unless they dismiss Cai Yuanpei from Peking University.

741
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,120
There is no peace in the capital

742
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,040
unless we expel Chen Duxiu from Beijing.

743
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,000
Well, Congress gave a notice

744
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,920
to the Capital Police Department

745
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,240
even posted the notices on our doors.

746
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,760
President Xu Shichang personally rebuked me.

747
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
Lu Xun is right.

748
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
It's time for decisive battle.

749
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
My new novel "Kong Yiji"

750
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,480
is almost finished.

751
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,800
Sir, I will write another novel.

752
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,400
I must compete with this Lin Qinnan, and defeat him!

753
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,560
Well, since everyone agreed to fight back.

754
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,880
Even there are thousands of enemies, I will fight!

755
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,560
It doesn't matter whether I goes or stays.

756
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
But I will never tolerate

757
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,560
that they kill our New Culture

758
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
which we cultivated little by little

759
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,560
in the cradle. I won't let that happen!

760
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,840
From tomorrow,

761
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,680
our four magazines will go into the battle together.

762
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,040
I'm in charge of "New Youth".

763
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,320
Shouchang is in charge of "Weekly Review"

764
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,880
and "Citizen".

765
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,320
Shizhi, you're in charge of "The Renaissance".

766
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,480
Everyone should write articles and show your magic.

767
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,840
We not only use our magazines

768
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,200
but also mobilize our students

769
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,240
to contribute extensively to major newspapers and publications.

770
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
Let's be overwhelming.

771
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,040
Shizhi, Shouchang.

772
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
You have appeal among students.

773
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Get your students started.

774
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,680
Let the lecture group go to the street!

775
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,160
They all hit the door.

776
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,920
How can we still be cowardice like turtles?

777
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,040
Zhongfu!

778
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Long live the New Culture Movement!

779
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,160
Long live the New Culture Movement!

780
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,120
Long live!

781
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,120
Teacher, look.

782
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,680
The are a lot of feedbacks

783
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
of your novel "Jingsheng"

784
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,840
made by the media.

785
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
Rave reviews!

786
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,440
I think Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu's good days

787
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,600
will end.

788
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,960
Sir,

789
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,800
foreshadowed by this "Jingsheng",

790
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,280
"Demon Dream" must be even more extraordinary.

791
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm sure that

792
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,720
these two novels of you

793
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,240
will leave a colorful chapter

794
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,840
in the history of Chinese literature!

795
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,880
I agree!

796
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,640
Fengzai, you notify the "New Morning Post"

797
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,840
not to publish "Demon Dream".

798
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,800
What?

799
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,920
Why?

800
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,280
What's the matter?

801
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,920
Look at this.

802
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,600
What?

803
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
Cai Yuanpei wrote you a letter?

804
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
He invited you to write an inscriptions on Liu Yingqiu's works

805
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,320
which will be published.

806
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,160
What does this mean?

807
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,960
Zhao Timeng wants to publish the works of Liu Yingqiu in the Ming Dynasty.

808
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,520
He asked Cai Yuanpei to help invite me, Liang Qichao,

809
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,920
Zhang Yan and Yan Fu to write a word or an inscription for it.

810
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,560
Cai Heqing let bygones be bygones.

811
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,080
He wrote to me personally and asked for help.

812
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,280
I am moved and shamed by his sincere words.

813
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
Why should you be shame?

814
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
I regard him as a demon.

815
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,080
But he regarded me as a great sage.

816
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,360
Compared with this, how can I feel no shame.

817
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
I have thought over this many times.

818
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,560
And the "Demon Dream"

819
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,360
had a direct attack on Cai Yuanpei.

820
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,360
Let's get it back and not publish it.

821
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,240
Teacher, your heart is too soft.

822
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,920
Maybe Cai Yuanpei is scared

823
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
after reading your novel.

824
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,120
So he came to please you.

825
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,680
Don't be fooled.

826
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,480
I agree.

827
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,960
He shouldn't.

828
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
Cai Yuanpei wrote the letter five days ago.

829
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,560
At that time, "Jingsheng" had not been published.

830
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,520
Sir

831
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,920
"Demon Dream" has been printed.

832
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,680
I'm afraid I can't get it back.

833
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
Hurry up and send a telegram to the "New Morining Post".

834
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,640
Make sure they stop.

835
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,600
I'll pay for any loss.

836
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,960
Sir, think twice.

837
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,360
Sir

838
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
The penalty plus compensation

839
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
will cost you a lot!

840
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,600
Money is small, personality is big.

841
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,160
Although I'm old,

842
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,600
I can't bear the blame of returning good for evil.

843
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
Please forgive disciple bluntly.

844
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,160
You are too gullible

845
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
and too easy to compromise.

846
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,600
Finally, we're going to win the battle against New Culture

847
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,960
with the help of the government.

848
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,080
How can you give up so easily?

849
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,200
I'm not compromising.

850
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,880
I can hold back my novel.

851
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,400
But my cultural position will never change.

852
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,160
I will write an open letter to Cai Yuanpei.

853
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,320
to denounce him conniving Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi and others.

854
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,600
I will firmly defend the orthodox position of Tongcheng School.

855
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,400
Teacher!

856
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,280
Good!

857
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,160
Sir, you're a real decent

858
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,240
and upright standard-bearer of Chinese studies.

859
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
Then let's do it now.

860
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,800
You send a telegram to recover the novel.

861
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm writing to denounce Cai Yuanpei.

862
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,200
OK

863
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560
No, I have to find this Old Master.

864
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,320
Uncle

865
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,640
He is angry now. Forget it.

866
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,760
Emm.

867
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,160
What does he think of on earth?

868
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,520
Writing novels and writing letters are all scolding Cai

869
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,400
Why doesn't he pick a easier way?

870
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,280
Uncle!

871
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,120
You are a politician.

872
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,600
You don't go to the mind of literatus.

873
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,960
Writing novels is innuendo.

874
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,560
That's swearing at the corner.

875
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
Writing a letter is different.

876
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,960
That's an open and clear position.

877
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
That's what the Old Master wants.

878
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Boy, will you really send telegrams

879
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
to get the novel back?

880
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,560
It's impossibe and crazy

881
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,240
to get back the spilled water.

882
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,320
If the Old Master

883
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,520
tells it to Cai Yuanpei,

884
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,840
what will you do if you confront each other in the future?

885
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,400
Let's take a bet!

886
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,960
I will also write a letter to Cai Yuanpei tomorrow.

887
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
I'll tell him that "Demon Dream"

888
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,520
couldn't be taken back.

889
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,200
I'll give him some more eye drops.
(=I'm going to sow discord between Cai and Lin.)

890
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Then there's big possibility that Cai and Lin

891
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
attack each other angrily.

892
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,760
You!

893
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,920
I have no other choice.

894
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,560
I have to do this.

895
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,840
Comrade Liu Mei,

896
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
what's going on in this article?

897
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,000
You have to explain!

898
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
I don't know what happened to this article.

899
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
I don't know "Shenzhou Daily".

900
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,200
I don't know this "Bangu Lu Xun"

901
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
I don't know who wrote this article.

902
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,280
Comrade Liu Mei, sit down first.

903
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,680
It's OK. Sit down.

904
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,880
Comrades.

905
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,160
Now is not the time that

906
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
we blame Comrade Liu Mei blindly.

907
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,040
The most important thing now

908
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,240
is to find out who did this.

909
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
I think the so-called Liao Zhi.

910
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,360
is the reporter named Cairen.

911
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,920
Yes, our enemy is not Liu Mei,

912
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,120
but Cairen.

913
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,440
What?

914
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,200
When did he become our enemy?

915
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,800
I don't think it's him.

916
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,880
Think about it. He came to help us.

917
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,120
How can he write such an article?

918
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,160
Yes.

919
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,440
Yes.

920
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,800
He was here to help us.

921
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,080
I don't think it's him either.

922
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Alright.

923
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,280
Stop discussing.

924
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,120
He Mengxiong, tell us why you think so.

925
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,600
Cairen talked to us twice.

926
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,960
He gave me a bad impression.

927
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,560
I can feel he isn't a good person.

928
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,840
In those two interviews,

929
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,600
he doesn't care what we say at all.

930
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,520
He just asked about what he was interested about.

931
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,520
Private questions about Liu Mei, Yannian

932
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,960
and Qunxian.

933
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,160
He clung to them.

934
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,600
I don't think his motive is pure.

935
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
I believe my feelings.

936
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,560
This man is insidious.

937
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,120
Second, the author of this article

938
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,480
is especially familiar with

939
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,480
the family backgrounds and experiences of our members.

940
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,920
Look, he said

941
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
the communist mutual aid society consisted of a group of

942
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,880
extreme young people inflenced by

943
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,160
Chen Duxiu's New Culture.

944
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
Besides Chen Duxiu's two sons,

945
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,800
the initiators include heretics

946
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,400
who were expelled from school

947
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,480
for advocating the abolition of filial piety.

948
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,720
there are also runaway and eloped women,

949
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,280
there are also violent people who specifically oppose the government,

950
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,400
and so on.

951
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,400
If I remember correctly

952
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,760
these things

953
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
are the most interested part of the reporter named Cairen

954
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,600
in our interview.

955
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,680
He interviewed me twice in private.

956
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,760
But what I said to him

957
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,680
is not reflected in this article.

958
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
What he cares about is not your opinion.

959
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,000
He wanted to guide the public

960
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,360
to destroy our mutual aid society

961
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,880
and ruin new culture.

962
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,920
Then we are in danger now.

963
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,360
Three working groups are struggling to operate.

964
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,560
No customers in our canteen.

965
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,000
The laundry team can't attract guests either.

966
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,920
At present, only movies can barely make both ends meet.

967
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,760
What's more, this article

968
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,360
overturned the public opinion that originally supported us.

969
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,640
We can't sit back and wait.

970
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
We have to dig out the man behind this.

971
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,080
I disagree with you.

972
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
I don't think this article is a bad thing.

973
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,080
The fact that someone attacked us

974
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,080
is actually advertising for us for free.

975
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
You should thank him.

976
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,480
I think so too.
