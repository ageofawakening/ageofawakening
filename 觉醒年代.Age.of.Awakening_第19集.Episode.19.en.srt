00:00:02,361 --> 00:00:05,469
[Episode Nineteen]

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,560
I see.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,000
Everyone here.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,680
Aspiring to be a journalist.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,040
Then I'll ask for advice. .

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,800
Today's society.

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,800
To be a qualified journalist.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,320
What basic qualities are needed? .

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,760
Please speak freely.

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,880
I'm all ears.

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,080
I think the most important thing is.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,680
objective.

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,480
I think it is.

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,280
learned.

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,680
You must dare to tell the truth.

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,480
ladies and gentlemen.

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,080
I am interested in the future.

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,400
Want to run a newspaper like Mr. Shao .

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
China today.

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,560
I think.

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,400
It's a great time for ideas to converge.

23
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,680
Do a good job.

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,360
Be a qualified journalist.

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,720
The most important quality.

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,080
Is erudition.

27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,200
Ancient and modern Chinese and foreign.

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
Literature and religion.

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
Philosophical geography.

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
Even the local conditions and customs of various countries.

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
If they can be integrated.

32
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,240
Can know everything.

33
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,080
Even if you know a thing or two.

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
Only in this way can you catch useful news.

35
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,480
Write a good article.

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,160
The reason why I went from Nanhai, Guangdong.

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,520
Come to Peking University to study.

38
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,640
Just want to rely on.

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,320
The highest institution of higher learning.

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,520
Get ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign.

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,880
All the knowledge.

42
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,720
Follow Mr Shao's example in the future.

43
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,240
Be an excellent newspaper man.

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,280
For the Chinese newspaper industry.

45
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,320
do one's bit.

46
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't think he's right. .

47
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,760
Hagen Troy Tan classmate.

48
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,520
What you said just now is very good. .

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,800
But a little bit. .

50
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,840
I beg to differ.

51
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,000
That's what you just said.

52
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,480
Want to be a qualified journalist.

53
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,920
First, go to college.

54
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,120
Even be worthy of.

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
A school like Peking University .

56
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
To be a qualified journalist.

57
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,160
Is that what you mean?

58
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,480
Zhongxia classmate.

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,560
Isn't that what it is? .

60
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,160
Now we in China.

61
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,280
Is it full of pounds?

62
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,120
Too many tabloid reporters.

63
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,040
This is precisely the sorrow of China's newspaper industry.

64
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,560
Good!

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,200
So the other students.

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
For member Chen.

67
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
What's the idea of this view?

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,600
The student.

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,560
You have the floor.

70
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Yes, sir.

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
I don't agree with this classmate's point of view.

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
At least his views are not comprehensive enough.

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
I think today's times.

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
Be a good journalist.

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,040
Knowledge is important. .

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
But it is not the only one.

77
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,520
Is not even the most important basic element. .

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,480
And!

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
This knowledge is not necessarily.

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,440
Completely from school education.

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
Society is also a university.

82
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,080
So I think ...

83
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,680
Be an excellent journalist.

84
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
More important than knowledge.

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,160
Is the human mind.

86
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
Position and professional ethics.

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,880
good.

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,960
Please be more specific.

89
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,480
I think.

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,240
As a journalist.

91
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,000
Can't follow others' advice.

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
The information you want to get for yourself.

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
analytic demonstration.

94
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,080
discard what is false and keep what is genuine.

95
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,280
from the surface to the centre.

96
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,360
Make your own judgment and conclusion.

97
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,080
of course.

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,480
The position here is crucial.

99
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
We have to stand in the position of the masses. .

100
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,880
Stand in front of the historical trend.

101
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
Safeguard the interests and demands of most people.

102
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,200
Our article.

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
Is conducive to the progress of this society. .

104
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,760
definitely.

105
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,920
Want to be a reporter.

106
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,240
First of all, we must strictly abide by professional ethics.

107
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,960
Follow the objectivity and authenticity of news.

108
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
Strive to adhere to the truth.

109
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
Insist on seeking truth from facts.

110
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,320
Consciously reject the temptation and pollution of interests.

111
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
We are now in troubled times.

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,880
Conduct is the most important thing.

113
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,080
Good point!

114
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,560
Fair enough. That's right.

115
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,760
Good point!

116
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,040
That's good.

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,200
Chen member.

118
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,680
Speech to your classmate.

119
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,800
What do you think?

120
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
I'd love to hear your argument.

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,960
Dear Mr Shao.

122
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,760
ladies and gentlemen.

123
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,480
I just want to remind you. .

124
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,440
The student.

125
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,320
Is not an official member of our research institute.

126
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,040
He's just.

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,360
An assistant in our Peking University library.

128
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
Don't you just.

129
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,400
let it be .

130
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,000
For her point of view.

131
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
I am unable and unwilling to comment.

132
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,400
How did you! It's not impressive.

133
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,160
That's too much to say .

134
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
How can you say that?

135
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
Isn't this unbearable?

136
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,760
Look down on people.

137
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,840
Your speech just now.

138
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
Makes me very sad.

139
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,120
how.

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,480
Do you think.

141
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,080
You are a student of Peking University.

142
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,440
Is it more noble than a library assistant? .

143
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,800
exactly.

144
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,080
Will princes and princes have seed? .

145
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
You should know the truth of this sentence.

146
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
But I don't think you are a prince. .

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
Nor is it a leader.

148
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
How do you know that classmate Mao Zedong.

149
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
Is not our member?

150
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
In my opinion.

151
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
Mazedong's Cognition of Journalism.

152
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
As good as you, a philosophy student at Peking University.

153
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
I finished.

154
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,360
nicely.

155
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,360
good.

156
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,640
Yuanmin.

157
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,840
So you are Mao Zedong, a 28-year-old painter.

158
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,680
sir.

159
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,480
Yes.

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
Mr. Yang Changji recommended you to me many times.

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
I also read your article.

162
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
Research on Physical Education.

163
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:41,920
right.

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,360
I'm inspired.

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,640
毛泽东.

166
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,840
I am very happy.

167
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,960
We have members like you in our news research society.

168
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,520
I'd like to welcome you to Beijing Daily.

169
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,360
Where can we communicate?

170
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,800
sit.

171
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,480
Okay, let's start the next topic. .

172
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,320
润之.

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,440
come on.

174
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,720
you see.

175
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,880
This is our editorial office.

176
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,560
Hello, Mr Shao.

177
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:10,960
good.

178
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Hello, Mr Shao.

179
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,640
good.

180
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,280
It's crude. Don't take it amiss.

181
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
Make yourself at home and make yourself at home.

182
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,120
润之.

183
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,640
What are you thinking?

184
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
Iron-shouldered hand.

185
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,520
Tiedan Daoyi.

186
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,960
Write a hot article.

187
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,680
sir.

188
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,200
I learned from this hot word.

189
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,680
can see.

190
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
Your persistence in truth.

191
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
And adherence to faith.

192
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,320
good.

193
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
You speak very well.

194
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,200
These four words.

195
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,640
Is my view of news.

196
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,760
At the same time I think .

197
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
As a journalist, you should have such ethics.

198
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,080
润之啊.

199
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,000
We must do justice.

200
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,200
Advocating ideas.

201
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,840
At the same time?

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,320
Or fear life and death to awaken the people.

203
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,640
This is our integrity and character.

204
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,120
sir.

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
Your character.

206
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
Students are taught.

207
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,840
be out of the question.

208
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,960
I am today.

209
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm not talking to you about ethics.

210
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
I just want to exchange ideas with you.

211
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,440
I need you to come with me .

212
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,880
Sit casually.

213
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,040
I have prepared excellent tea for you.

214
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
What about today?

215
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
Bianpin tea.

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Side to side.

217
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:19,680
be it so.

218
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,040
润之.

219
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
You said earlier.

220
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
A reporter.

221
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
Should have his position and thoughts.

222
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,680
This is particularly important.

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
I am deeply impressed.

224
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,080
so.

225
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,280
I want to ask.

226
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,960
You recently.

227
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,320
Do you read any books?

228
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,480
What book code is there?

229
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Have no ideas of their own.

230
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,080
sir.

231
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
I am usually in Changsha.

232
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,760
It is rare to see any new books.

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
so.

234
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
As long as I can find it.

235
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,800
I'll watch them all.

236
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,200
As for what kind of new ideas to believe in.

237
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,560
Not yet.

238
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,160
But relatively speaking.

239
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,360
At this stage.

240
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,880
I'm against anarchism.

241
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,000
More impressive.

242
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,320


243
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,480


244
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
anarchism.

245
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
I had a good feeling for it before. .

246
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,640
Especially Krupotkin's mutual aid theory.

247
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,400
But in the past year.

248
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,920
I'm interested in socialism.

249
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,680
Have a strong interest.

250
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,400
润之.

251
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Did you know that last year.

252
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
The revolution in our country.

253
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,360
I've heard of it.

254
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,440
This time to Beijing.

255
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
I often listen to Mr. Shouchang and Mr. Zhongfu.

256
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
Then I went to the library to check the information.

257
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
But it's all bits and pieces.

258
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
No concrete system has been formed yet.

259
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
寿昌先生.

260
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
I see.

261
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
He is studying Marx's historical materialism.

262
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
I was also influenced by him.

263
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,440
Just started to contact socialism.

264
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,480
it suddenly occurs to me that.

265
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,800
These materials.

266
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,560
It's about Marxism.

267
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,920
And the Russian revolution.

268
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,800
Take a look.

269
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
I'm inspired.

270
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:44,960
sit.

271
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,480
sit.

272
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,800
What about me?

273
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,480
It will take some time.

274
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,680
Put these.

275
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,040
Go through it all again.

276
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
Publish two books.

277
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,520
It's called A Comprehensive Study of Social Thoughts in Various Countries.

278
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,400
Where's the other one?

279
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
It's called The Study of New Russia.

280
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,680
i believe.

281
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
As long as these two books are published.

282
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Will definitely give it to the Chinese ideological circle.

283
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
Bring a new breath of air.

284
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,640

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
This world.

286
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,400
Is developing rapidly.

287
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,400
We work in journalism.

288
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,520
Can't lag.

289
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,840
We must keep up closely.

290
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,440
The pace of this era.

291
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,280

292
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,560
I will.

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:41,920


304
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,640
Shao Fengping helped me a lot.

305
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
Shao Piaoping helped me a lot.

306
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
He is a lecturer at the Press Society. .

A passionate ideal.

We won.

314
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
Brother Tang, you are really a dragon and a horse spirit.

315
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,360
The victory of the European War was expected.

316
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
I don't need you either.

317
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,520
Call in the middle of the night.

China became a victorious country for the first time.

321
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,440
Can you still sleep?

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,520


323
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,320
Can you still sleep?

Such a victorious country.

325
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,760
is it interesting.

326
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
Is it worth celebrating?

327
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
Whatever they think.

328
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,200
To defeat a country is to defeat jade. .

329
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,640
You're not happy yourself.

330
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,480
Can somebody else make you happy?

00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,040
And the important documents of the October Revolution in Russia.

359
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200

This is the triumph of justice over power.

384
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,080
The result of this axiom defeating power.

385
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
People all over the world should understand.

386
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,480
Both internally and externally .

387
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
Power is unreliable.

388
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,840
Justice is absolutely indispensable.

389
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:43,680
good.

390
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,680
good.

391
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,080
Next, please welcome the president of Peking University.

392
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
Mr Cai Yuanpei delivered a speech.

393
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:00,800
good.

394
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,120
Fellow countrymen and classmates.

395
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
The disastrous world war is over.

396
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,400
The allies won.

397
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
This victory is hard to come by.

398
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
We will ride the east wind.

399
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,080


400
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,240
Put the unequal darkness in the world.

401
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,000
Destroy.

402
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
Use Illuminatism.

403
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,840
Replace it.

404
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,400
Okay, okay, okay.

405
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,880
I hope that there is a power theory in China.

406
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,840
Believing in dogmatism.

407
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,280
To plot and cling to prejudice.

408
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,400
We must give up this kind of darkness quickly.

409
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,400
Make efforts for the bright future of China.

410
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,280
Expel power and welcome light.

411
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,560
Expel power and welcome light.

412
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,440
Expel power and welcome light.

413
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
Expel power and welcome light.

414
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,400
nicely.

415
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
Fellow citizens.

416
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,280
We are celebrating victory in recent days.

417
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,960
It's very lively.

418
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,120
But I want to ask a question.

419
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,440
Which one did we defeat?

420
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,280
We celebrated.

421
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,880
Which one are you celebrating for?

422
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
I honestly say a fair word.

423
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
This victory is by no means the force of the United Nations. .

424
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,480
But the new spirit of mankind all over the world. .

425
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,560
This time, it is not any country that has been defeated.

426
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,040
Or the politics of warlords or capitalists.

427
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,600
But the people of the world.

428
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,440
We celebrated.

429
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,160
And it's not for any country.

430
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,520
Or a part of a country. .

431
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,360
It's a celebration for people all over the world. .

432
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,560
We are not celebrating to defeat Germany. .

433
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,320
But to defeat the militarism of the world.

434
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,760
And celebrate.

435
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,760
Okay, okay, okay.

436
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:30,640


437
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:30,720


438
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,600
Fellow countrymen and classmates.

439
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
Today among you.

440
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
Come a lot.

441
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
Workers brothers in Xindian.

442
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
I want to say a word to you. .

443
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Notice of the future world.

444
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
To become a world of labor.

445
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,920
We should use this trend. .

446
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,240


447
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,440
Make everything everyone.

448
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
The opportunity to become workers.

449
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,920
This trend should not be used.

450
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,280
Make everything everyone.

451
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
The chance to become robbers.

452
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,680
Anyone who doesn't work for nothing.

453
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,760
Are robbers.

454
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,440
Robbers and robbers.

455
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,280
Seek illegitimate property.

456
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,040
That's also a robber.

457
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
It makes no difference.

458
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,400
So I want to say .

459
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,160
labour.

460
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,320
long live.

461
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:31,360
Long live the labor, long live the labor.

462
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,600
Let me tell you two.

463
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
Attend this rally today. .

464
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
I have a new perception.

465
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,520
I feel our new culture movement.

466
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,840
Has reached a new turning point. .

467
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
Of course, I still feel very dirty.

468
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,560
Of course, my feeling is still very glandular.

469
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,280
What about the past.

470
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,000
We are always in the study on campus.

471
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
Wenrenduili.

472
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,440
Today, we came to the society.

473
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,640
Into the public.

474
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,560
I feel heaven and earth.

475
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
All of a sudden it widened.

476
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Cai Gong, you feel so right.

477
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,840
I feel the same way with you.

478
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
When I heard Shouchang shout out.

479
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,240
Long live the labor.

480
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,360
I got goose bumps all over.

481
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,920
It's like seeing a new world.

482
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
Found new vitality.

483
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,120
Brother Zhongfu goes to the public.

484
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,680
This is the turning point we are looking for.

485
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
Shouchang, you are good today.

486
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,160
That speech of yours.

487
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
Make the question clear and accurate.

488
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,960
I look!

489
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
Not only do you want to be the director of Peking University Library? .

490
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,520
You will also be a professor at Peking University. .

491
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,560
You are in the propaganda and agitation of the masses .

492
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,800
You are better than Zhongfu Shizhi and all of them.

493
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,000
You flatter me.

494
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
寿昌还提出.

495
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
Outside "New Youth".

496
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,160
Run another Weekly Review.

497
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,360
Commenting on current affairs and politics, mobilizing people.

498
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,360
I think it should be put on the agenda.

499
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,320
中富啊.

500
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,000
"New Youth" is not only to be done.

501
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,880
Weekly review.

502
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
We should put the strength of all teachers and students in Peking University.

503
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,640
Mobilize.

504
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
Take advantage of the victory of the European war. .

505
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,680
The fire that awakens my Chinese culture .

506
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,680
Burn up while you can.

507
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,320
Ok, let's arrange the meeting when we go back to our liberal arts department.

508
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
Your country has arrived.

509
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,920
Zhou Li should be restored.

510
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,080
My old inspiration has also come.

511
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,200
Look, this is a new novel written by the old lady.

512
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,040
Jingsheng and Demon Dream.

513
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,760
I want to ride the east wind of victory in the European war. .

514
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
Jiang Cai Yuanpei Chen Duxiu.

515
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,240
Hu Qian Xuantong.

516
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
These deviant demon engines.

517
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,560
Go to the moral court.

518
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,920
What the teacher said is right.

519
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,560
Lin Gong!

520
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,360
Look at this.

521
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,960
This is what I wrote for our magazine National Heritage.

522
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,160
Write the publication of.

523
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,120
Look at this sentence.

524
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,400
The national enemy is to awaken our generation and refresh Yan Gang.

525
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,080
Blowing dust.

526
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Save people with lofty ideals.

527
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Heli encircles the nest Chen Duxiu Hu Shi, etc.

528
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,880
Forget the ancestors, mess with the country and spoil the customs.

529
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,280
nicely.

530
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,640
Open the door with a clear-cut stand.

531
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,400
good.

532
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
Uncle Shen, come and have a look. .

533
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,640
come.

534
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,200
They are all colleagues in the same institution of higher learning.

535
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,280
You're naming names like this, and you're falling out.

536
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,800
Right.

537
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,520
What's more, the funds of "National Heritage".

538
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,360
Or approved by Zhongfu.

539
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,360
Uncle Shen, you are too soft-hearted.

540
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Then Chen Duxiu is Cai Yuanpei.

541
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
Got a big cancer for Peking University.

542
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,440
Do not eradicate it.

543
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,640
There is no peaceful day in Peking University.

544
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,280
Uncle Shen.

545
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,520
I don't think you should treat that Chen Duxiu.

546
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
Have any illusions?

547
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,400
Let me tell you.

548
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
Peking University will soon cancel the senior system.

549
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
And Chen Duxiu, a liberal arts senior,.

550
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,920
No energy consumption till summer vacation. .

551
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,520
It's hard to say. .

552
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,640
It is said that Tom and Shen Yinmo.

553
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
These people are in front of Cai Yuanpei.

554
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,360
I haven't given Chen Duxiu less eye drops recently.

555
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,720
It seems that the lineup of their new culture.

556
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,280
Has begun to differentiate.

557
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,880
exactly.

558
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
As far as I know.

559
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
李大钊跟胡适.

560
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
There is disagreement on many issues.

561
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Li Dazhao advocates direct discussion of politics.

562
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Shi advocates only academic discussion.

563
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay, great.

564
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
The opportunity has finally come.

565
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,600
Masters are making academic challenges.

566
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
I use my knife in politics.

567
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,880
Teacher, I will submit a bill to Congress tomorrow.

568
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Black Cai Yuanpei, the president of Peking University. .

569
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,880
驱逐陈独秀.

570
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,640
nicely.

571
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,880
I declare that I am brilliant.

572
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
Never do anything to destroy Mr Cai Yuanpei.

573
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,280
I'm sorry to leave now.

574
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm leaving now, too.

575
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,240
Uncle Shen.

576
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,240
Shenshu.

577
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,280
What a cliche!

578
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,800
I was just laughing at people's differentiation.

579
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,080
As a result, I broke up first.

580
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,760
my kind and respected master/teacher/mentor.

581
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,680
Teacher, don't worry. .

582
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,840
I'm in no hurry and I'm not afraid. .

583
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,600
I'm Zhong Kui the ghost hunter.

584
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,800
I'm just going to be with them.

585
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,160
fight to the end.

586
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,320
After the victory of the European War.

587
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,720
It's like the enthusiasm of our Chinese people.

588
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
It was suddenly ignited.

589
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
I don't know if everyone has noticed.

590
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,560
It's on this street now.

591
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,920
Those new things.

592
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,200
There are many.

593
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,040
Peking University is no exception.

594
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
Less than a month's time.

595
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,400
Twenty kinds of newspapers and magazines associations.

596
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
It came out.

597
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
There is such an emerging situation in Peking University.

598
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,440
You want me to say it?

599
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,400
This new culture is the result of its development in Peking University. .

600
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,200
So I want to thank Mr. Zhong Geng. .

601
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,040
Sir, you flatter me.

602
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,560
We asked for a research fund from the Ministry of Education.

603
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,920
It is mainly intended to be earmarked for funding. .

604
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,520
Academic research of our liberal arts.

605
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,120
So encourage teachers and students.

606
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,440
Run more community magazines.

607
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,120
So everyone's enthusiasm.

608
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
It was mobilized.

609
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,480
The mushrooming is unstoppable.

610
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,400
Mr. Cai.

611
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,440
At the beginning, you proposed to run more community publications.

612
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
I still have concerns.

613
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
Think about Peking University?

614
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Do not have a broad foundation for academic research.

615
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
So science didn't move.

616
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,880
I really regret it now .

617
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,040
The liberal arts group started to move.

618
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,040
The atmosphere of the whole school has changed.

619
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,400
That's great.

620
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,440
That's right.

621
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,040
Before?

622
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,040
Our students from Peking University are outside class. .

623
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
There is neither noble entertainment.

624
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
There is no automatic organization.

625
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,240
So what about outside the school? .

626
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
Often engage in some abnormal pastimes.

627
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,160
exactly.

628
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,200
But, ah.

629
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,800
Since it was recently opened.

630
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
Since various societies and societies.

631
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,560
This ethos has greatly changed.

632
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Students spontaneously organized together.

633
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,600
I'll never go to that shelter again.

634
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,920
Ah, this liberal arts is a driving force.

635
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
Students from all subjects followed suit.

636
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
Spontaneously set up the association Chinese Literature Society. .

637
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,680
Society of Historiography and Mathematics.

638
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,160
There is also an interdisciplinary calligraphy research society.

639
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,520
And so on.

640
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,120
Of course, the research is in-depth.

641
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,880
There are even more controversial issues.

642
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,920
What about academic issues?

643
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,440
It's a mess now.

644
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,720
What a joy!

645
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,720
This is not afraid, this is not afraid.

646
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,040
This argument is always a good thing.

647
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,240
I also advocate argument.

648
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,080
中富兄.

649
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,920
I heard that liberal arts magazines.

650
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
There's been some controversy lately, isn't there?

651
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,400
Our liberal arts side.

652
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,400
Fu Sinian, who is the main school of Chinese literature.

653
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,000
And English literature.

654
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,680
Wait for a few classmates, Luo Jialun.

655
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
This magazine, Trendy, was co-founded.

656
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,280
And the one from the Student Salvation Association.

657
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,160
Xu Luo and other students founded "National".

658
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,480
And Yu Shizhen's "National Heritage".

659
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,760
Just these magazines.

660
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
They have different views.

661
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
The tit-for-tat quarrel is very hot.

662
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,120
What about this classmate?

663
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,800
He is willing to set up a club to run a magazine.

664
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,880
To cultivate their own interests.

665
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,360
To make your own remarks.

666
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
To promote their own ideas.

667
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,840
And views on current events.

668
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,680
I think this should be advocated.

669
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
This is important for how they view current events.

670
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,280
How to Improve Academic Communication.

671
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,280
Cultivate one's sentiment.

672
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
And expand your horizons.

673
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,960
Are of great benefit.

674
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,120
On this basis.

675
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,760
To improve students' spiritual cultivation.

676
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,280
So I thought.

677
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,720
The more magazine associations, the better.

678
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
So all subjects.

679
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,480
Open the door and experiment boldly.

680
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
What I want to tell you is.

681
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
This is just the beginning of Peking University's innovation.

682
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,880
The reform of the system should continue to keep up.

683
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,240
for example.

684
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,160
The senior system we are implementing now.

685
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,040
It is a transitional one.

686
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,800
Temporary system.

687
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,960
What Peking University is doing now is to abolish the door and change the department.

688
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
Then the senior system will be cancelled soon.

689
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,760
To set up the Academic Affairs Office.

690
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
To unify the leadership of school teaching.

691
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,640
So the science chiefs.

692
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,840
You should be mentally prepared.

693
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
I feel a lot of noise.

694
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,360
It should be changed. Yeah.

695
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,880
All right, let's talk about it here today.

696
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,920
good.

697
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
Brother Zhongfu, stay here.

698
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,280
I have something else to discuss with you.

699
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,400
good.

700
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,360
Let's drink some water first.

701
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,360
What I just mentioned about the school innovation.

702
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
What do you think?

703
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
If Peking University wants to become a world-class university.

704
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
That must keep up with the world trend.

705
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,720
This is the trend.

706
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,760
This senior system really can't become the norm.

707
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,720
So I very much agree with your reform plan.

708
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,440
Now we have to cancel the senior system.

709
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,520
What are you going to do?

710
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
I've been trying my best recently.

711
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,480
Prepare the Weekly Review.

712
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,960
I think this publication.

713
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,760
It is a platform for us to go public.

714
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm looking forward to it.

715
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,720
Now it's just me and Shouchang.

716
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,080
Not enough.

717
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,360
But I think.

718
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,360
if possible.

719
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,880
I want to focus on this publication.

720
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,800
中富兄啊.

721
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I have always had a wish.

722
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
Just want to write a book.

723
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,080
General History of China with academic weight .

724
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,520
I want to come and go.

725
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,200
Only you are the most suitable.

726
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,120
So I want to invite you.

727
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,760
He is also the director of the compilation and fundraising department of Peking University National History Museum.

728
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,600
To lead the editor of the General History of China. .

729
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,280
Brother Xian, what do you think? .

730
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,800
Brother Zimin.

731
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,400
You are dissatisfied.

732
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,000
Now I.

733
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,560
All my interests are in the Weekly Review.

734
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,920
I think reality is more important than history.

735
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,920
What about this Weekly Review?

736
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,560
We can ask Shouchang to excuse me a little more.

737
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,800
Now Shizhi is back.

738
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,800
He can also share some.

739
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,560
So Shouchang and Shizhi.

740
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
They have different ideas.

741
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,120
Always arguing.

742
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm afraid they'll fight again if I'm not careful.

743
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,720
In fact nothing.

744
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,160
You're the leader.

745
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,840
They can't argue much.

746
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
You want me to say it?

747
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,040
Something specific.

748
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,880
Let the young people do it.

749
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,560
Do you like it?

750
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,080
Let me talk to Shizhi.

751
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,800
good.

752
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,960
sir.

753
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,840
I'm leaving.

754
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,000


755
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,160


756
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,160
Sell newspapers.

757
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,120
Selling newspaper.

758
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,120
Hard sister-in-law.

759
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,320
Yes, sir.

760
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,000
Brother Zhongfu, come and sit here.

761
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,040
Your dining room gets off here.

762
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,080
Okay.

763
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,280
史鸷啊.

764
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
You have been away from Beijing for less than a month.

765
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,440
Great changes have taken place in Peking University. .

766
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
Student factories in various departments.

767
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,960
Vigorously set up associations.

768
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,320
Intramural publications.

769
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,800
That also appeared several copies at once.

770
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
You run New Tide.

771
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,440
Liu Shipei Huang Ni takes some people.

772
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,120
Run the "National Heritage".

773
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,280
These magazines fight.

774
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,960
There was a lot of noise.

775
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,000
What "National Heritage"?

776
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,840
I just want to be retro.

777
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,680
Just some.

778
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,280
Therefore, the setting sun of our country is dark. .

779
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,600
Huang Cuo is always holding that recently.

780
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,280
The first draft of the publication.

781
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,560
Ask for advice everywhere.

782
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,160
Actually, it was a demonstration.

783
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,960
How ah.

784
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,560
Is it like sitting here in your own yard?

785
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,440
be like.

786
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,640
Is it cold?

787
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
No, it's cool.

788
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,680
You went on to say .

789
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,520
Did you say Huang Ni just now?

790
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,960
I heard they also.

791
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,400
Scold us both by name.

792
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
I think they flatter me.

793
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,120
Now scold us.

794
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,040
It's not just the National Heritage family.

795
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,120
Now it's a North-South linkage.

796
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,320
Can't be pretty.

797
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,400


798
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,560
Can't be pretty.

799
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,720


800
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,440


801
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,400
Our "New Youth".

802
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't you grow up in the midst of abuse?

803
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,240
Are you afraid of being scolded by others, Chen Zhongfu? .

804
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,760
It's not enough to be afraid.

805
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,440
Fight back!

806
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,400
no problem.

807
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,680
I'll write an article.

808
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,880
Argue with them.

809
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,680
I just want to discuss it with you. .

810
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,480
The new culture movement should go to the masses.

811
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,240
Face the reality.

812
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,440
So I thought.

813
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,960
Outside "New Youth".

814
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,880
Run a weekly review.

815
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,880
It's a supplement to New Youth.

816
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
What Mr. Cai means is.

817
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,000
I'd like you to help Shouchang host it.

818
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,440
The Weekly Review, right?

819
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,280
What is the purpose of the Weekly Review?

820
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,840
What is it?

821
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
Weekly Review and New Youth.

822
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,560
Do your job.

823
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,680
Focus on different.

824
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,440
New Youth focuses on ideological enlightenment.

825
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
The Weekly Review focuses on current affairs.

826
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,960
Criticize reality.

827
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
On some political issues, practical issues.

828
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,000
comment.

829
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,680
中富兄.

830
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,920
You've been saying no politics for 20 years.

831
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
But everything you do.

832
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,320
Why are they all involved in politics?

833
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,480
史鸷啊.

834
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,920
You can't keep clinging to this problem.

835
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,760
Actually, I already said that. .

836
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,360
Not talking about politics does not mean not studying current affairs.

837
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,040
In that case.

838
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,720
Then let's do the National Heritage, too.

839
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,640
Brother Zhongfu, you misunderstood me.

840
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm not saying that I don't approve of the Weekly Review. .

841
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,320
For practical problems.

842
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,600
I really didn't study it.

843
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,040
And lack of interest.

844
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,120
I have a lot on my hands right now.

845
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,360
The first volume of Outline of Chinese Philosophy History.

846
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,400
It will be published immediately.

847
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,560
Mr Cai made me the director of the English department.

848
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,720
Fu Sinian pulled me hard again.

849
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,240
I went to New Fashion as a consultant. .

850
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
Plus my mentor, Mr Dewey.

851
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,640
Will soon come to China to give lectures.

852
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I have to contact many things about him.

853
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,000
I have to go.

854
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
Okay, okay, I know.

855
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
I know you're busy.

856
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,080
But isn't Shouchang more than you?

857
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,240
Look at him.

858
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
How many clubs and magazines have you run?

859
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,640
Really became the leader of the youth.

860
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,480
It's true to be a scholar.

861
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,840
But when the whole country is observing.

862
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,600
Isn't responsibility more important?

863
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,640
Brother Zhongfu teaches you very well.

864
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,640
I let you down.

865
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,520
fault.

866
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,120
Don't mind.

867
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,040
I said this because I thought you were my confidant. .

868
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,400
I see.

869
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,560
Why don't you think so?

870
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,280
during this period.

871
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,880
I won't host the Weekly Review.

872
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,400
I must write more articles.

873
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,560
After this time, I will take over from Shouchang. .

874
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,920
how about.

875
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,440
Two big professors.

876
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,440
Don't freeze in the yard.

877
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,880
One pot is ready.

878
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,480
eat rice.

879
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,320
eat rice.

880
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,760
Here we go.

881
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,480
ladies and gentlemen.

882
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,120
Hold a press conference today.

883
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,080
To explain to our friends in the press.

884
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,760
This trip to Paris.

885
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,080
The itinerary of the delegation attending the peace conference.

886
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,120
How many of us can represent China?

887
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
As the representative of the victorious country.

888
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,960
Go to France to attend the peace conference.

889
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,720
And feel extremely honored.

890
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,160
Let me introduce it first.

Du Lu Zhengxiang.

896
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,440
Be the head of the delegation.

897
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,440
I won't introduce them here.

898
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,640

For me in China.

912
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

913
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,080
China needs to use this conference.

Seek a certain degree of fair treatment .

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,080
And for half a century.

916
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,840
The painful consequences suffered by China have been corrected.

917
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
Please ask questions below.

918
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,400
Excuse me, Chief Lu.

919
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,720
How do you predict the outcome of this meeting?

920
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,480
Is the outlook optimistic?

921
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
Can it really be as you said?

922
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
But for half a century.

923
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,800
To correct the painful consequences suffered? .

924
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,160
In this big war.

China's victory over the Allies .

926
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,560
Made a significant contribution.

927
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Here I can tell you.

928
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
Back in China.

929
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,920
Before sending hundreds of thousands of laborers to the war.

930
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,800
Britain and France promised China.

931
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,280
At the post-war peace conference.

932
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,240
Give China five conference seats.

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,840

The victorious country can't ask for compensation for ceded land.

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,320
Secret diplomacy should be abolished.

1036
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,840
Should pass.

It's promising.

1043
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,320
Can justice conquer power?

1044
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,840
Depends on the Paris Peace Conference.

1045
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,080

Advocating China everywhere.

1054
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,360
Can last a hundred years of international failure.

1055
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,280
Get a big turn from now on. .

1056
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,280
Look at this Mr. Liang. .

1057
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,880
It's cute and naive.

1058
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,440
I guess I didn't eat enough for foreigners.

1059
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,520
Shouchang, I think you are too pessimistic.

1060
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Paris peace conference will play a leading role.

1061
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,120
It is the United States, Britain and France.

1062
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,280
Wilson's opinion represents.

1063
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,040
The common proposition of the United States and Britain .

1064
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,000
So let me see.

1065
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,280
The situation in China is very good. .

1066
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,400
be promising.

1067
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,920
Shizhi, don't forget.

1068
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,040
Behind us.

1069
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,640
There's also a Japan that's waiting for you.

1070
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,120
In front of the United States, Britain and France.

1071
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,360
Can Japan still play a leading role? .

1072
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,440
It does not play a leading role.

1073
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
But you can't guarantee that the United States, Britain and France.

1074
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,960
Are standing in the same trench with us.

1075
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,720
Brother Zhongfu, what do you think.

1076
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,240
I agree with Shizhi.

1077
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,040
I have studied a lot of Wilson's speeches.

1078
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,040
I think he is a gentleman. .

1079
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
He made two suggestions.

1080
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,760
Countries are not allowed to take power.

1081
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,600
To violate the equality and freedom of other countries. .

1082
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,720
Governments are not allowed to take power. .

1083
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,320
To violate the equality and freedom of the people. .

1084
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,000
I thought about it.

1085
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,360
As long as you do these two things .

1086
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,520
That justice must triumph over power.
