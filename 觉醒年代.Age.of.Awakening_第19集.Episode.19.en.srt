In today's society,

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,800
what basic qualities are needed

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,320
to be a qualified journalist?

I think the most important thing is

00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,680
to be objective.

and came to Peking University to study,

41
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,640
is that I want to learn from

with one thing.

54
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,000
What you said earlier, is that

to be a qualified journalist,

56
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,920
you must first go to university,

57
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,120

I don't agree with my classmate's point of view.

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
At least his views are not comprehensive enough.

76
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
I think in today's times,

77
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
in order to be a good journalist,

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,040
it's important to be well-read,

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
but it is not the only element,

80
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,520
and it's not even the most important one.

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,480
And,

82
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
this knowledge is not necessarily

83
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,440
completely attainable from university education.

84
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
Society is also a university.

85
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,080
So I think,

86
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,680
to be an excellent journalist,

87
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
what's more important than knowledge

88
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,160
are people's thoughts

89
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
positions, and professional ethics.

90
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,880
Good.

91
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,960
Please be more specific.

92
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,480
I feel

93
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,240
that as a journalist,

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,000
one cannot follow others' advice.

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
One must analyze and demonstrate

96
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
the information one has obtained,

97
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,080
discard what is false and keep what is genuine,

98
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,280
from the outward appearance to the inner essence,

99
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,360
and make one's own judgment and conclusion.

100
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,080
Of course,

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,480
the position here is crucial.

102
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
We have to stand in the position of the masses,

103
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,880
stand in front of the historical trend,

104
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
and safeguard the interests and demands of the majority of the people.

Our articles

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
must be conducive to the progress of this society.

107
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,760
Of course,

108
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,920
to be a reporter,

109
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,240
we must first of all strictly abide by professional ethics,

110
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,960
follow the objectivity and authenticity of news,

111
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
strive to adhere to the truth,

112
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
insist on seeking truth from facts,

113
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,320
and consciously reject the temptation and pollution of interests.

114
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
We are now in troubled times,

115
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,880
conduct is the most important thing.

116
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,080

That's right!

118
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,760
Well said.

119
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,040

Never mind.

133
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,000
I am unable and unwilling to comment

134

How can you look down on people?

136
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,160
That's too much to say.

137
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
How can you say that?

138
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
Isn't this unbearable?

139
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,760
Looking down on people!

140
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,840
Your speech just now

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
makes me very sad.

142
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,120
How

143
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,480
do you think

144
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,080
that you, as a student of Peking University,

145
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,440
makes you more noble than a library assistant?

146
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Exactly.

147
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,080
Are nobles and officals born with good fortune and noble seeds?

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
You should know the truth of this sentence.

149
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
But I don't think you are a noble

150
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
nor are you an offical.

151
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
How do you know that Student Mao Zedong

152
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
is not our member?

153
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
In my opinion,

154
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
Mao Zedong's knowledge of journalism

155
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
is no worse than that of you, a philosophy student of Peking University.

156
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
I'm done.

157
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,360

from this hot word,

192
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,680
I can see

193
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
your persistence in truth

194
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
and adherence to faith.

195
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,320
Good.

196
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
You speak very well.

197
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,200
These four characters

198
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,640
is my view of news.

199
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,760
At the same time I think,

200
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
as a journalist, you should have such ethics.

201
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,080
Runzhi,

202
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,000
we must uphold justice

203
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,200
and advocate ideas.

204
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,840
At the same time,

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,320
don't be afraid of life and death to awaken the people.

206
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,640
This is our integrity and character.

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,120
Sir,

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
your character

209
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
is what you teach your students.

210
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,840
That's out of the question.

211
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,960
Today,

212
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm not talking to you about ethics.

213
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
I just want to exchange ideas with you.

214
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,440
I need you to come with me.

215
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,880
Sit casually.

216
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,040
I have prepared excellent tea for you.

217
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
Today, we'll have

218
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
a cup of bianpin tea,

219
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
and talk heart-to-heart.

220
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:19,680
Very well.

221
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,040
Runzhi,

222
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
you said earlier

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
that a reporter

224
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
should have his own position and thoughts.

225
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,680
This is particularly important.

226
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
I am deeply impressed.

227
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,080
So,

228
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,280
I want to ask,

229
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,960
have you recently

230
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,480
read any books?

231
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Do you have any ideas of your own?

232
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,080
Sir,

233
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
I am usually in Changsha.

234
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,760
It is rare to see any new books.

235
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
So,

236
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
as long as I can find them,

237
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,800
I'll read them all.

238
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,200
As for what kind of new ideas to believe in,

239
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,560
it's far from certain.

240
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,160
But relatively speaking,

241
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,360
at this stage,

242
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,880
I have a deep interest

243
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,000
in anarchism.

244
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:56,523
Uh-huh.

245
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
Anarchism.

246
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
I used to like it very much.

247
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,640
Especially Krupotkin's mutual aid theory.

248
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,400
But in the past year,

249
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,920
I have gained a strong interest

250
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,680
in socialism.

251
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,400
Runzhi,

252
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
do you know the revolution

253
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
that happened in Russia last year?

254
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,360
I've heard of it.

255
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,440
This time in Beijing,

256
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
I often listened to Mr. Shouchang and Mr. Zhongfu.

257
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
Then I went to the library to check the information.

258
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
But it's all bits and pieces.

259
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
There is no specific system in place yet.

260
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
Mr. Shouchang.

261
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
I see.

262
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
He is studying Marx's historical materialism.

263
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
I was also influenced by him

264
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,440
before I came into contact with socialism.

265
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,480
Right.

266
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,800
These materials

267
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,560
are about Marxism

268
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,920
and the Russian Revolution.

269
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,800
Take a look.

270
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
I'm inspired.

271
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:44,960
Sit.

272
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,480
Sit.

273
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,800
What about me?

274
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,480
It will take some time.

275
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,680
Go through

276
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,040
all these again.

277
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
These two published books

278
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,520
are called "A Comprehensive Study of Social Trends in Various Countries",

279
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,400
the other one

280
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
is called "The Study of New Russia".

281
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,680
I believe,

282
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
as long as these two books are published,

283
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
they will definitely bring a new breath of air

284
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
to the Chinese ideological circle.

285
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,640
Runzhi,

286
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
this world

287
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,400
is developing rapidly.

288
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,400
We can't lag behind

289
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,520
in journalism.

290
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,840
We must keep up closely

291
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,440
with the pace of this era.

292
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,280
Sir,

293
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,560
I will.

294
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
Can I often come to you for advice?

295
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,720
Runzhi,

296
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
the doors of the "Peking Gazette"

297
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,320
are forever open to you.

298
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,040
Uh-huh.

299
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,360
Years later,

300
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
Mao Zedong told American journalist

301
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,960
Edgar Snow, and said

302
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
Shao Piaoping had helped me a lot.

303
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
He was a lecturer of the Press Society,

304
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,640
a liberal,

305
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
a person of passionate ideals

306
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
and excellent qualities.

307
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,760
Hello?

308
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:25,725
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

309
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
Jiemin, good news.

310
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,520
Germany surrendered.

311
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,720
We won!

312
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
Brother Botang, you really have a vigorous spirit.

313
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,360
The victory of the war in Europe was expected,

314
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:37,162
[Wang Daxie, styled Botang]

315
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
and I don't need you

316
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,520
call in the middle of the night

317
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
to wake me up.

318
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,240
Jiemin, old boy, it's been almost eighty years

319
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
since China has been a victorious country.

320
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
Can you still sleep?

321
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
Is being a victorious country

322
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,760
that interesting?

323
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
Is it worth celebrating?

324
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
Whatever they think,

325
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,200
a victorious country is a victorious country.

326
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,640
You're not happy yourself.

327
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,480
Can somebody else make you happy?

328
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,240
Jiemin, old boy,

329
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,840
it's been many years

330
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,200
but we can finally hold our heads high for once.

331
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
We should celebrate with great fanfare.

332
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,520
Thank you, Brother Botang, for your advice.

333
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,160
I see.

334
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,880
It should be celebrated.

335
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,560
In 1918,

336
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
World War I

337
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
ended with the victory of the Allies over the Central Powers.

338
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,080
China had become a victorious country.

339
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
The news came through and the nation went wild.

340
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,880
People immersed in the joy of truth

341
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,080
over power.

342
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Renaming the Ketteler Memorial, a symbol of shame,

343
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
as The Victory of Justice Gate.

344
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,200
Li Dazhao published, during this period,

345
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,960
"The Victory of Bolshevism",

346
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
"The New Era", and other articles.

347
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,560
At Central Park,

348
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,800
he also delivered a speech entitled "The Victory of the Common People",

349
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,240
pointing out the victory of this war

350
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,240
was not the force of the Allies,

351
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
but the new spirit of the human world

352
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
and the common people all over the world.

353
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,240
"The Victory of the Common People" and other articles

were Li Dazhao's important literature

355

for spreading Marxism and the October Revolution in Russia,

356
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
which showed that he had formed

357
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,520
the Marxist position and viewpoint,

358
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,040
and promoted the spread of Marxism in China.

Fellow citizens!

Ever since

361
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
Germany had lost the war,

362
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,080
"righteousness conquering power"

363
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,200
has become almost everyone's mantra.

Then you know what justice is?

00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,400
What is power?

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,320
In short,

368
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
that which accords with equality and freedom

369
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,480
is justice.

370
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,440
That which relies on its own strength

[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

375

and strong military,

376

specifically infringed on the equality and freedom of all countries.

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
People all over the world should understand,

382
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,480
both at home and abroad,

383
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
that power cannot be relied upon

384
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,840
and justice can never be ignored!

385
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:43,680
Good!

386
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,680
Good!

387
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,080
Next, please welcome the President of Peking University,

388
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
Mr. Cai Yuanpei, to deliver a speech.

389
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:00,800
Good!

390
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,120
Fellow countrymen! Fellow classmates!

391
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
The disastrous world war is over.

392
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,400
The Allies have won.

393
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
This victory is hard to come by.

394
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
We should take advantage of this east wind

395
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,240
to wipe out the darkness of inequality

396
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,000
in the world,

397
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
and use enlightening theories

398
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,840
to replace it!

399
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,400
Good! Good!

400
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,880
I hope that all those in China who worship power,

401
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,840
worship arbitrariness,

402
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,280
conspire and act in prejudice,

403
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,400
will give up this kind of darkness quickly

404
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,400
in order to make efforts for the bright future of China.

405
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,280
Expel power and welcome light!

406
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,560
Expel power and welcome light!

407
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,440
Expel power and welcome light!

408
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
Expel power and welcome light!

409
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,400
Hurrah! Hurrah!

410
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
Fellow citizens!

411
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,280
We are celebrating victory in recent days.

412
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,960
It's very lively.

413
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,120
But I want to ask a question.

414
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,440
Which victory did we win?

415
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,280
Which victory

416
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,880
are we celebrating?

417
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
I'll be honest and give a fair statement.

418
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
The victory this time is not the force of the Allies,

419
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,480
but the new spirit of mankind all over the world.

420
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,560
This time, it is not the politics of a warlord

421
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,040
or capitalist in any country that is defeated,

422
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,600
but the common people of the world.

423
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,440
We are not celebrating

424
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,160
for any country

425
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,520
or part of people in any country.

426
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,360
It's a celebration for people all over the world.

427
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,560
We are not celebrating the defeat of Germany,

428
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,320
but the defeat of militarism

429
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,760
around the world.

430
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,760
Hurrah! Hurrah!

431
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,600
Fellow countrymen. Fellow students.

432
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
Today,

433
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
there are many worker brothers

434
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
from Changxindian among you.

435
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
I want to tell you all in a word

436
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
that the future world

437
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
will become a world of workers.

438
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,920
We should use this trend

439
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,440
to give everyone

440
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
an opportunity to be workers,

441
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,920
and not use this trend

442
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,280
to give everyone

443
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
an opportunity to be robbers.

444
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,680
Those who do not work for a living

445
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,760
are robbers!

446
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,440
Robbers and robbers!

447
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,280
Conspiring to own unjustified property.

448
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,040
That's also a robber!

449
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
It makes no difference.

450
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,400
So I want to say

451
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,160
long live

452
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,320
the workers!

453
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:31,360
Long live the workers! Long live the workers!

454
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,600
Let me tell you two.

455
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
After attending this rally today,

456
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
I have a new perception.

457
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,520
I feel that our New Culture Movement

458
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,840
has reached a new turning point.

459
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,560
Of course, my feeling is still very hazy.

460
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,280
In the past,

461
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,000
we were always in the campus, in study rooms

462
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
with literati.

463
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,440
Today, we came to society

464
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,640
and entered the public sphere.

465
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,560
I feel the heavens and the earth

466
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
have suddenly widened.

467
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Master Cai, you are so right.

468
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,840
I feel the same way with you.

469
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
When I heard Shouchang shout out

470
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,240
"Long live the workers!",

471
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,360
I got goose bumps all over.

472
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,920
It's like seeing a new world,

473
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
finding a new vitality.

474
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,120
Brother Zhongfu, going to the public

475
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,680
is the turning point we are looking for.

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
Shouchang, you are good today.

477
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,160
Your speech

478
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
made the question clear and accurate.

479
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,960
I see that,

480
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
not only do you want to be the director of Peking University Library,

481
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,520
you will also be a professor at Peking University.

482
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,560
You, in public speaking and agitation of the masses,

483
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,800
are better than Zhongfu, Shizhi, all of them.

484
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,000
You flatter me.

485
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
Shouchang also proposed

486
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
to set up a "Weekly Review"

487
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,160
in addition to "New Youth",

488
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,360
commenting on current affairs and politics, mobilizing people.

489
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,360
I think it should be put on the agenda.

490
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,320
Zhongfu,

491
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,000
"New Youth" should not only run

492
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,880
"Weekly Review".

493
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
We should integrate and mobilize all the teachers and students

494
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,640
of Peking University,

495
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
and take advantage of the victory of the European war,

496
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,680
to ignite the fire

497
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,680
of our awakening Chinese culture.

498
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,320
Ok, let's arrange the meeting when we go back to our liberal arts department.

499
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
Ladies and gentlemen, the destiny of our country has arrived.

500
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,920
The Rites of Zhou should be restored.

501
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,080
The old man's inspiration has also come.

502
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,200
Look, these are new novels written by the old man:

503
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,040
"Jingsheng" and "Demon Dream".

504
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,760
I want to take advantage of the victory in Europe

505
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,845
[Gu Hongming, born Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

506
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
to bring Cai Yuanpei, Chen Duxiu,

507
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,240

[Lin Shu, styled Qinnan]

00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
these deviant demon engines,

510
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,560
to be judged for their immorality.

511
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,920
What the mentor said is right.

512
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,560
Master Lin Shu.

513
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,360
Look at this,

514
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,960
this is an introduction written by me for our magazine

515
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,160
"National Heritage".

516
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,120
Look at this sentence.

517
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,400
Scholars of national heritage, should be the ones who wake up our generation to reverse the decay

518
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,080
fan the dust,

519
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
save the culture of the people,

520
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
and join forces to fight against Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi and others

521
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,435
[Liu Shipei, styled Shenshu, Professor at Peking University]

522
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,880
who forget their ancestors, betray the country, and corrupt the customs.

523
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:54,721
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Professor at Peking University]

524
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,280
Good, good.

525
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,640
To the point, a firm position, and straight towards the enemy.

526
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,400
Good!

527
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
Brother Shenshu, come and have a look.

528
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,640
Here.

529
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,200
These are all colleagues of the same institution of higher learning.

530
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,280
Is it appropriate for you to name names and quarrel with each other

531
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,800
like this?

532
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,520
What's more, the funding of "National Heritage"

533
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,360
was approved by Zhongfu.

534
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,360
Brother Shenshu, you are too soft-hearted.

535
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Chen Duxiu is a cancer that Cai Yuanpei

536
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
brought to Peking University,

537
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,440
and he will not eradicate it.

538
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,640
There is no peaceful day in Peking University.

539
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,280
Brother Shenshu.

540
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,520
I don't think you should have any illusions

541
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
about that Chen Duxiu.

542
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,400
Let me tell you.

543
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
Peking University will soon cancel the senior system,

544
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
and it's hard to say whether Chen Duxiu,

545
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,920
a liberal arts dean,

546
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,520
can spend the summer vacation without spending so much energy.

547
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,640
It is said that Tang Er and Shen Yinmo,

548
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
have recently given Chen Duxiu tears

549
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,360
in front of Cai Yuanpei.

550
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,720
It seems that the formation of their New Culture

551
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,280
has begun to break apart.

552
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,880
Exactly.

553
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
As far as I know,

554
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
Li Dazhao and Hu Shi

555
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
disagree on many issues.

556
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Li Dazhao advocates direct discussion of politics.

557
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Hu Shi advocates only academic discussion.

558
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay, excellent.

559
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
At last, the opportunity has come.

560
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,600
The masters are academically fighting amongst themselves.

561
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
I will make my moves in politics.

562
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,880
Mentor, I will submit a bill to the National Assembly tomorrow

563
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
to remove Cai Yuanpei, the President of Peking University,

564
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,880
and expel Chen Duxiu.

565
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,640
Good, good.

566
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,880
I declare that I, Gu Hongming,

567
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
will never do anything to undermine Mr. Cai Yuanpei.

568
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,280
I'm sorry to leave now.

569
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm leaving now, too.

570
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,240
Brother Shenshu.

571
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,240
Shenshu.

572
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,280
Well, what pedantic scholars they are.

573
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,800
I was just laughing at them scheming to split up the masters.

574
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,080
The result is that they broke up first.

575
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,760
Mentor.

576
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,680
Teacher, don't worry.

577
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,840
I'm in no hurry and I'm not afraid.

578
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,600
I'm the ghost hunter, Zhong Kui.

579
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,800
I just want to fight them

580
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,160
to the end.

581
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,320
After the victory in Europe,

582
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,720
it's like the enthusiasm of our Chinese people

583
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
was suddenly ignited.

584
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
I don't know if everyone has noticed.

585
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,560
In this street now,

586
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,920
there are many

587
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,200
new things happening.

588
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,040
Peking University is no exception.

589
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
In less than a month's time,

590
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,400
twenty kinds of newspapers, magazines, and associations

591
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
have sprung up.

592
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
There is such an emerging situation in Peking University.

593
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,440
You want me to say it?

594
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,400
This is the result of New Culture in Peking University.

595
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,200
So I want to thank Mr. Zhongfu.

596
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,040
Sir, you flatter me.

597
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,560
We asked for a research fund from the Ministry of Education.

598
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,920
It is mainly intended to be used to fund

599
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,520
academic research of our liberal arts,

600
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,120
so teachers and students are encouraged

601
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,440
to run more community magazines.

602
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:30,987
[Xia Yuanli, styled Fuyun, Dean of Science at Peking University]

603
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,120
Then everyone's enthusiasm

604
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
will be mobilized.

605
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,480
The mushrooming is unstoppable.

606
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,400
Mr. Cai.

607
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,440
At the beginning, you proposed to run more community publications.

608
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm also worried

609
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
that Peking University

610
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
does not have a broad foundation for academic research.

611
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
So science research is not advancing.

612
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,880
I really regret it now.

613
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,040
The liberal arts department has begun to advance.

614
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,040
The atmosphere of the whole school has changed.

615
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,400
That's great.

616
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,440
That's right.

617
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,040
In the past,

618
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,040
our students from Peking University, outside class,

619
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
had no noble recreation

620
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
nor self-driven organization.

621
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,240
So outside school,

622
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
they often engage in some unnatural pastimes.

623
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,160
Exactly.

624
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,200
Well,

625
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,800
various clubs and societies

626
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
recently opened.

627
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,560
This ethos has greatly changed.

628
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Students spontaneously organized together

629
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,600
and no longer go to sing-song houses.

630
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,920
Ah, this liberal arts is a driving force.

631
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
Students from all subjects followed suit

632
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
and spontaneously set up associations, like the National Literature Society,

633
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,680
the Historiography Society, the Mathematics Society,

634
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,160
and also an interdisciplinary calligraphy research society,

635
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,520
and so on.

636
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,120
Of course, the research is in-depth.

637
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,880
There are even more controversial issues.

638
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,920
And the academic issues?

639
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,440
It's such a mess.

640
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,720
How perfect.

641
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,720
This is not scary, this is not scary.

642
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,040
These debates are always a good thing.

643
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,240
I also advocate debates.

644
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,080
Brother Zhongfu,

645
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,920
I heard that there has been some controversy lately

646
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
regarding the liberal arts magazines, isn't there?

647
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,400
On our liberal arts side,

648
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,400
Fu Sinian, from Chinese literature,

649
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,000
and Luo Jialun and other students,

650
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,680
from English literature,

651
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
co-founded the magazine "The Renaissance".

652
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,280
There is also the one from the Student Salvation Association,

653
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,160
"Citizen" founded by Xu Luo and other students,

654
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,480
and "National Heritage" by Yu Shizhen and others.

655
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,760
These magazines

656
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
all have different views.

657
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
The tit-for-tat quarrel is very hot.

658
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,120
These students

659
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,800
are willing to set up a club to run a magazine,

660
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,880
to cultivate their own interests,

661
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,360
to make their own remarks,

662
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
to promote their own ideas,

663
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,840
and views on current events.

664
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,680
I think this should be promoted.

665
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
How they view current events,

666
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,280
improve academic communication,

667
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,280
cultivate one's sentiment

668
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
and expand one's horizons

669
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,960
is of great benefit.

670
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,120
On this basis,

671
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,760
let's improve students' spiritual cultivation.

672
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,280
So I thought,

673
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,720
the more magazines, the more associations, the more societies, the better.

674
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
Therefore, all subjects

675
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,480
should open the door and experiment boldly.

676
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
What I want to tell you is,

677
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
this is just the beginning of Peking University's innovation.

678
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,880
The reform of the system should continue to keep up.

679
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,240
For example,

680
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,160
the senior system that we have currently

681
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,040
is a transitional one.

682
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,800
A temporary system.

683
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,960
What Peking University is doing now is to abolish the door and change the department,

684
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
then the senior system will be cancelled soon

685
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,760
to set up the Academic Affairs Office

686
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
and to unify the leadership of school teaching.

687
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,640
So the science chiefs,

688
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,840
you should be prepared.

689
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
I feel a lot of noise.

690
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,360
It should be changed. Yeah.

691
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,880
All right, let's talk about it here today.

692
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,920
Good.

693
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
Brother Zhongfu, stay here.

694
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,280
I have something else to discuss with you.

695
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,400
Alright.

696
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,360
Let's drink some water first.

697
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,360
About the innovation at school that I just mentioned,

698
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
what do you think?

699
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
If Peking University wants to become a world-class university,

700
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
then it must keep up with the world trend.

701
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,720
This is the trend.

702
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,760
This senior system really can't become the norm.

703
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,720
So I very much agree with your reform plan.

704
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,440
Now we have to cancel the senior system.

705
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,520
What are you going to do?

706
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
I've been trying my best recently

707
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,480
to prepare the "Weekly Review".

708
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,960
I think this publication

709
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,760
is a platform for us to go public.

710
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm looking forward to it.

711
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,720
Now it's just me and Shouchang.

712
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,080
It's not enough.

713
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,360
But I think,

714
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,360
if possible,

715
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,880
I want to focus on this publication.

716
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,800
Brother Zhongfu,

717
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I have always had a wish

718
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
to just write

719
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,080
an academic book called the "General History of China".

720
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,520
I want to think about it.

721
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,200
I think you are the only one who is most suitable,

722
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,120
so I want to invite you

723
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,760
to be the director of the National History Museum of Peking University

724
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,600
to lead the editing of the "General History of China".

725
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,280
Brother, what do you think?

726
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,800
Brother Jiemin

727
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,400
will be dissatisfied with his saying

728
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,000
that all my interests

729
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,560
are in the "Weekly Review".

730
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,920
I think reality is more important than history.

731
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,920
This "Weekly Review"

732
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,560
can make Shouchang excuse me a little more.

733
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,800
Now that Shizhi is back,

734
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,800
he can also share some.

735
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,560
Shouchang and Shizhi

736
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
have different ideas.

737
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,120
Always arguing.

738
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm afraid they'll fight again if I'm not careful.

739
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,720
In fact, it's nothing.

740
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,160
You're the leader.

741
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,840
They can't argue much.

742
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
You want me to say it?

743
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,040
Something specific.

744
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,880
Let the young people do it.

745
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,560
Do you like it?

746
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,080
Let me talk to Shizhi.

747
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,800
Good.

748
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,960
Sir,

749
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,840
I will leave now.

750
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,160
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

751
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,120
Selling newspapers!

752
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,120
You work so hard, sister-in-law.

753
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,320
Thank you, sir.

754
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,000
Brother Zhongfu, come and sit here.

755
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,040
The dining room is in here.

756
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,080
Okay.

757
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,280
Shizhi,

758
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
you have been away from Beijing for less than a month.

759
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,440
Great changes have taken place in Peking University.

760
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
Student from various departments

761
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,960
vigorously set up associations,

762
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,320
several on-campus publications

763
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,800
have also appeared at once.

764
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:50,010
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

765
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
You run "The Renaissance".

766
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,440
Liu Shipei and Huang Kan took some people

767
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,120
to run "National Heritage".

768
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,280
There was a lot of fighting

769
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,960
between these magazines.

770
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,000
What "National Heritage"?

771
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,840
They just want to restore the old ways.

772
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,680
But it's just

773
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,280
sobbing for the old era's sunset.

774
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,600
Recently, Huang Kan is always asking

775
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,280
for advice with the first draft

776
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,560
of that publication.

777
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,160
Actually, it was just a show of force.

778
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,960
How are you two?

779
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,560
Is it like sitting here in your own yard?

780
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,440
Feels like home.

781
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,640
Is it cold?

782
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
No, it's fine.

783
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,680
You were saying?

784
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,520
Did you say Huang Kan just now?

785
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,960
I heard they also

786
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,400
scolded us both by name.

787
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
I think they flatter me.

788
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,120
It's not just the "National Heritage" thought

789
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,040
that scolds us now.

790
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,120
Now the North-South alliance

791
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,440
is menacing, so we can't underestimate it.

792
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,400
Didn't we "New Youth"

793
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
grew up in the midst of abuse?

794
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,240
Are you afraid of being scolded by others, Chen Zhongfu?

795
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,760
It's not enough to be afraid.

796
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,440
You need to fight back.

797
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,400
No problem.

798
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,680
I'll write an article

799
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,880
and argue with them.

800
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,680
I just want to discuss with you.

801
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,480
The New Culture Movement should go to the masses

802
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,240
and face the reality.

803
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,440
So I thought,

804
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,960
outside "New Youth",

805
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,880
we could run a "Weekly Review"

806
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,880
as a supplement for "New Youth".

807
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
What Mr. Cai means is

808
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,000
he'd like you to help Shouchang run it.

809
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,440
The "Weekly Review", right?

810
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,280
Then what is the purpose

811
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,840
of the "Weekly Review"?

812
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
"Weekly Review" and "New Youth"

813
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,560
have their own roles

814
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,680
with different focuses.

815
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,440
"New Youth" focuses on ideological enlightenment.

816
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
The "Weekly Review" focuses on current affairs,

817
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,960
criticizes reality,

818
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
and comments on

819
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,000
political issues and current issues.

820
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,680
Brother Zhongfu,

821
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,920
you said no politics for 20 years,

822
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
But why does everything you do

823
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,320
have to be involved in politics?

824
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,480
Shizhi,

825
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,920
you can't keep clinging to this problem.

826
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,760
Actually, I already said that

827
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,360
not talking about politics does not mean not studying current affairs.

828
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,040
In that case,

829
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,720
let's do the "National Heritage", too.

830
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,640
Brother Zhongfu, you misunderstood me.

831
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm not saying that I don't approve of the "Weekly Review".

832
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,320
I really have no research

833
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,600
and lack of interest

834
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,040
in practical problems.

835
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,120
I have a lot on my hands right now.

836
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,360
The first volume of the "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy"

837
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,400
will be published soon.

838
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,560
Mr. Cai made me the director of the English department.

839
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,720
Fu Sinian dragged me

840
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,240
to "The Renaissance" as a consultant again.

841
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
Plus my mentor, Mr. Dewey

842
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,640
will soon come to China to give lectures.

843
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I have to discuss many things with him.

844
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,000
and make plans.

845
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
Okay, okay, I know.

846
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
I know you're busy.

847
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,080
But isn't Shouchang more busy than you?

848
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,240
Look at him.

849
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
How many clubs and magazines have been set up,

850
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,640
and they have really become leaders of young people?

851
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,480
It's true to be a scholar.

852
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,840
But when the whole country is watching,

853
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,600
isn't responsibility more important?

854
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,640
Brother Zhongfu is instructing me

855
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,640
that I let him down.

856
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,520
Don't.

857
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,120
Don't mind.

858
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,040
I said this because I thought you were my confidant.

859
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,400
I see.

860
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,560
Why don't you think so?

861
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,280
During this time,

862
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,880
I won't host the "Weekly Review".

863
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,400
I must write more articles.

864
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,560
After this time, I will take over from Shouchang.

865
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,920
How about that?

866
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,440
The two professors.

867
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,440
Don't freeze in the yard.

868
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,880
One pot is ready.

869
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,480
Time to eat.

870
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,320
Let's eat.

871
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,760
Here we go.

872
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:09,836
[Lu Zhengxiang, styled Zixin, Foreign Minister of the Republic of China]

873
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,480
Ladies and gentlemen.

874
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,120
today's press conference is held

875
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,080
to explain to friends in the press

876
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,760
the itinerary of the delegation to Paris

877
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,080
to attend the Peace Conference.

878
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,120
How many of us will represent China?

879
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
As the representative of a victorious country,

880
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,960
it is a great honor to attend

881
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,720
the peace conference in France.

882
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,160
First, let me introduce

883
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
composition of our delegation.

884
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,400
Our delegation includes

885
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,160
delegate plenipotentiaries, foreign country experts, secretaries, etc.

886
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,600
A total of more than 50.

887
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,720
I, Lu Zhengxiang,

888
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,440
will be the head of the delegation,

889
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,440
so I won't introduce myself here.

890
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,640
Other key members of the delegation include

891
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,040
Mr. Hu Weide, Ambassador to France,

892
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,440
Mr. Shi Zhaoji, Ambassador to Britain.

893
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,080
The three of us are plenipotentiaries.

894
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,040
In addition, Mr. Gu Weijun, Ambassador to the United States,

895
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,840
Mr. Wei Chenzu, Ambassador to Belgium,

896
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,840
are ambassador plenipotentiaries and special committee members.

897
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,600
A few days ago,

898
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,960
our ambassadors Hu, Wei, and Shi

899
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,960
had gone to Paris to negotiate

900
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,240
and attend the preparatory meeting before the peace conference.

901
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
Fellow members of the press,

902
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,800
the peace conference held in Paris,

903
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,480
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

904
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
for our China.

905
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,080
China needs to use this conference

906
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,760
to seek a certain degree of fair treatment

907
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,080
to correct the painful consequences

908
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,840
suffered by China for half a century.

909
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
Please ask your questions.

910
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,400
Excuse me, Minister Lu,

911
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,720
how do you predict the outcome of this conference?

912
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,480
Is the outlook optimistic?

913
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
Is it really possible, as you said,

914
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
to correct the painful consequences

915
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,800
suffered for half a century?

916
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,160
In this war,

917
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,920
China's victory over the Central Powers

918
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,560
made a significant contribution.

919
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Here I can tell you,

920
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
back in China,

921
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,920
before sending hundreds of thousands of laborers to the war,

922
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,800
Britain and France promised China,

923
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,280
at the post-war peace conference,

924
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,240
to give China five conference seats,

925
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,560
and treat each other as big countries.

926
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,000
So people are full of confidence in this conference.

927
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,640
Good!

928
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,440
May I ask,

929
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,600
Kevin Lu, what is the plan that you have come to offer

930
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,760
to this peace conference?

931
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,360
Well.

932
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,080
Our delegation

933
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
have prepared seven proposals at this time.

934
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,800
One, the abolition of the sphere of influence.

935
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,800
Two, the withdrawal of foreign troops and patrol officers.

936
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,840
Three, the abolition of foreign post offices and wired telegraph offices.

937
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,880
Four, the cancellation of extraterritorial jurisdiction.

938
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,120
Five, the return of leased land.

939
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,360
Six, the return of concessions.

940
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,320
Seven, the freedom of customs duties.

941
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,080
Good!

942
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,400
Good.

943
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
Distinguished minister,

944
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,800
we see that your proposed bill

945
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,280
covers a wide range of questions.

946
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,240
Do you think that these requirements

947
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,240
can be met at this conference?

948
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,720
I think you may all remember,

949
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,240
a month ago,

950
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,760
President Xu ordered,

951
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,600
the legacy of the "Boxer Protocol",

952
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,560
the Kettler Memorial,

953
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,960
to be moved from Dongdan to Central Park,

954
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,520
and planned to rewrite the inscription as follows:

955
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
Righteousness triumphs.

956
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,840
You ask me: will these proposals

957
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,400
be passed at this conference?

958
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,400
I just want to answer:

959
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,040
righteousness will triumph over might!

960
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,800
Good.

961
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,440
Excuse me, Minister Lu,

962
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,640
when you go to Paris for the meeting,

963
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,640
how should you handle the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

964
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,960
The government of the Republic of China has appointed

965
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,040
Mr. Chen Zhuan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs,

966
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,800
as acting foreign minister.

967
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,680
At the same time...

968
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,920
At the same time, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Committee will be established

969
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,800
as the decision-making body of China's diplomacy.

970
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,920
This is the end of today's press conference.

971
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,360
Thank you all.

972
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,680
OK, thank you.

973
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,720
Thank you very much.

974
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,600
Thank you.

975
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,400
Thank you.

976
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,200
Thank you.

977
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,920
Minister Lu.

978
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,680
Presidential orders.

979
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I just finished a press conference here.

980
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,960
What are they up to again?

981
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,640
What orders?

982
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
This visit to Europe to discuss peace and relations is very important,

983
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,160
and the main seat is specially appointed as a special plenipotentiary ambassador

984
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,120
for the purpose of diplomacy in the main court.

985
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,560
He has sent a telegram from Minister Gu to Wang Zhengting,

986
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,360
and his appointment order was also sent to the U.S. Embassy for transmission.

987
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,760
I hope that Lu will turn around

988
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,600
and contact Chun to advise him.

989
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,720
Xu Shichang.

990
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,200
What's going on here?

991
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,520
Didn't the southern government mention long ago

992
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,440
that it would set up its own delegation to attend the peace conference?

993
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,200
Isn't the president not allowed?

994
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,200
The president originally refused

995
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,120
to send representatives from the North and the South.

996
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,080
But Dr. Wang Zhengting of the southern government

997
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
has arrived in New York.

998
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,800
He himself contacted and convinced the United States

999
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,360
that Rui Enshi, the American envoy to China,

1000
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,640
put pressure on the president last night.

1001
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
The president had to nod his head

1002
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,080
to get this appointment.

1003
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,640
What's the point of talking about diplomacy

1004
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,240
when you're looking at foreigners' faces everywhere?

1005
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,840
This... this...

1006
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,600
This Wang Zhengting,

1007
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,200
what is his ranking?

1008
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,040
It's not clear in the appointment letter.

1009
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,040
Chen Zhuan said that after you

1010
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,360
is the ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary.

1011
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,160
A country's delegation

1012
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,440
should have people from the two governments.

1013
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
It's bound to be a lot of problems.

1014
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,920
I want to speak to Wang Daxie.

1015
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,600
Get me Wang Daxie!

1016
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,880
I noticed U.S. President Wilson's

1017
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,240
speech in Congress.

1018
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,600
He proposed that

1019
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,280
if the world is to have a permanent peace,

1020
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,960
a new order should be established.

1021
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,880
Old-fashioned diplomatic methods

1022
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,320
should no longer be used to solve the problem of war.

1023
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,440
Victorious countries can't ask for land-cutting reparations,

1024
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,320
but abolish secret diplomacy.

1025
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,840
A new order

1026
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,920
should be created by establishing an organization

1027
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
to maintain world peace.

1028
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,840
This 14-point plan builds

1029
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,040
a new international morality.

1030
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,120
It seems that right triumphs over power this time.

1031
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,160
It's promising.

1032
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,320
Can justice conquer power?

1033
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,840
Depends on the Paris Peace Conference.

1034
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,080
I heard that the representative of this delegation

1035
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,920
is Foreign Minister Lu Zhengxiang.

1036
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,200
I also heard that

1037
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
Liang Qichao, entrusted by Xu Shichang,

1038
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,880
is lobbying in Europe

1039
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,360
to canvass for our Chinese proposal

1040
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,480
at the Paris Peace Conference.

1041
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,120
Liang Rengong (=Liang Qichao) is full of confidence this time.

1042
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,800
Advocating China everywhere

1043
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,360
can last for a hundred years,

1044
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,280
and the international failure has since won a big turn.

1045
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,280
I think Mr. Liang

1046
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,880
is cute and naive.

1047
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,440
I guess I didn't eat enough for foreigners.

1048
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,520
Shouchang, I think you are too pessimistic.

1049
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The Paris Peace Conference will play a leading role

1050
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,120
in the United States, Britain and France.

1051
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,280
Wilson's idea represents

1052
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,040
the common idea of the United States, Britain and France.

1053
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,000
So I think

1054
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,280
the situation in China is very good.

1055
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,400
It's promising.

1056
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,920
Shizhi, don't forget.

1057
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,040
Behind us.

1058
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,640
There's also a Japan that's waiting for you.

1059
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,120
Can Japan still play a leading role

1060
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,360
in front of America, Britain and France?

1061
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,440
It does not play a leading role.

1062
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
But you can't guarantee that the United States, Britain and France

1063
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,960
are standing in the same trench with us.

1064
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,720
Brother Zhongfu, what do you think?

1065
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,240
I agree with Shizhi.

1066
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,040
I have studied a lot of Wilson's speeches.

1067
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,040
I think he is a gentleman.

1068
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
He made two suggestions.

1069
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,760
One, no country is allowed to use power

1070
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,600
to infringe upon the equality and freedom of other countries.

1071
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,720
Two governments of all countries are not allowed to use power

1072
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,320
to infringe upon the equality and freedom of the people.

1073
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,000
I thought about it,

1074
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,360
as long as you do these two things,

1075
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,520
then justice must triumph over power.
