[Episode Twenty-six]

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,440
Mom, my brother is eating without permission

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,720
Tell him to stop

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,080
Wait till dad comes back

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,200
Dad's back

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,160
Time to eat, Dad

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,360
Dad, come and eat.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,200
You are back

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,800
Just in time, wash your hands and eat

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,320
No

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,720


13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,920
Someone pissed you off again?

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,880
No

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,400
Something happened at uni?

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,680
No

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,960
Let's eat then.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,920
No

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,760


20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
But the kids won't eat without you start first

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,040
Why not

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,600
Zimei, Henian

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,040
If you are hungry, eat first.

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,080
Don't wait for me.

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,240


26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,720
Make me look like a feudal parent.

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,320
Where are you going?

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,760
Don't interfere, I am gonna start writing.

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
And you say you are not the feudal parent

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,840
I see you totally are

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,520
eat

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,520
Dad, come and eat

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,400
Dad, come and eat

34
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,400
sit down

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,480
Specially made for you, dumplings with chives and eggs filling

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,760
Wilson's intervention

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,880
Temporarily hindered

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
Japan pushing it's scheme on rights in Shandong Province

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,480
But on the second day after 

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,400
Italian Prime Minister Orlando left the Conference

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
Japan representative Makino Nobuaki

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
seized the chance to talk

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,240
Insisting the only way to solve the issue on Shandong Province

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,000
is to meet his terms

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
Otherwise, Japan will refuse to sign the peace treaty

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
And quit the Paris Peace Conference

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
The situation plummet

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,680
Beijing Foreign Affairs Committee of the Republic of China

49
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,680
Chairman Wang

50
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,800
America, Britain, France, Italy and Japan

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,400
They are holding a second meeting

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
Discussing the Shandong issue

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,480
The request of Chinese representatives to attend the meeting has been rejected.

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
From last night until now.

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,240
We requested three times for a meeting with Wilson

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
Lloyd George, Clemenceau

57
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,160
Yet all been declined

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,320
Please inform us of the countermeasure as soon as possible

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
Cabinet Minister

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
Shall we rediscuss the content in this message?

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,200


62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,360


63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,920
Nothing to discuss here

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,240


65
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,320


66
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,960
Send it now. Go

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,360
ladies and gentlemen

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,840
We are at the end of our tether now.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
There is only one thing we can do now

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,600
To wait

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
Mr. Zixin, calm down first

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,400
take a break

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm like an ant in a heating wok right now

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
I dont know which way I should march to for my survival

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
How on earth can I calm down

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,800
I understand

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,720
But you need to be in a good condition now

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,160
If you break down

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,320
we will only be stuck even deeper

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
Respond from BeiJing

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,840
read

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,760
Seek for President Wilson's help at all costs

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,680
Fine, no time for dignity now

84
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
Let's seperate into five groups

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
Go to the four exits of the conference room respectively.

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
And the elevator entrance in the basement, Tan Shou

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,240
Whoever sees Wilson

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,920
whatever you do, stop him 

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
And inform me fast

90
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,360
Let's do it

91
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,080
Go now!

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,160
My fellow friends

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,520
We have to do this

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
What kind of diplomacy do we have here

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,800
Is this even diplomacy when we are blocking the door?

96
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Dear President Wilson

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
Please help us.

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
No matter what.

99
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,200
Mr Gu

100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,040
Let me be honest with you

101
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
My second proposal.

102
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,920
was just rejected 

103
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,960
President Wilson

104
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,720
Your Fourteen Points put forward

105
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
Has become a household name in China.

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,120
Hundreds of millions of Chinese

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,920
Are eagerly looking forward to it

108
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
That right over might

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
I remain committed to the plan

110
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,840
But whatelse can I do now but leave

111
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,880


112
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,200
President Wilson, you are capable.

113
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
We fully believe 

114
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
and rely on American influence.

115
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,800
General Lu

116
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,680
Let me borrow a phrase from Chinese.

117
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,440
If I had known this day was goinng to happen, I wouldn't have lived it

118
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Had it not been for the Twenty-one Aticles you signed

119
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,040


120
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
In the willing agreement of Zhang Zongxiang

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,440


122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,400


123
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,360
Gentleman, I think we would be in a very different situtaion right now

124
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
Mr.President

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Is there really no chance to fix it?

126
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
It all depends on your own effort tomorrow at the conference

127
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,480


128
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,880
You are the last hopw

129
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
Gentlemen, good day

130
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
Don't work too hard, Shaochuan

131
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,760
How's the preparation going?

132
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
Total mess

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,440
Mr. Zixin

134
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,720
Do you think there is any hope for us?

135
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,640
hope

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Treat a dead horse as if it's alive

137
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
We will give them our dying kicks

138
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,320
We must try, right?

139
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,200
Shaochuan, you have to understand

140
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,680
This speech of yours

141
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,280
Is our last hope to save ourselves

142
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,160
Please

143
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,120
Mr. Zixin

144
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,080
I've never understood why since the Republic of China

145
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,480
so many once ambitious people committed suicides

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
Today, I can see why

147
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
Shaochuan, I know.

148
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
I put you on the spot.

149
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,400
If it was not for the guilt I have on my back

150
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,160
for signing the Twenty-one Demands

151
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,760
Tomorrow's conference

152
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
I would never let you rush to the front.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,360
Come

154
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,080
you see

155
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,520
I found your favorite stinky tofu.

156
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,520
Stinky tofu with bread, combination of Chinese and Western

157
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,280
Mr. Zixin

158
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,840
Thanks for your consideration

159
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,480
Don't worry, I won't back down.

160
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
There's still some time for me to get ready.

161
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,200
Shaochuan

162
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,440
On behave of thousands of millions Chinese.

163
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
Thank you

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
This flavor is the best

165
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,920
Messenger

166
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,480
Minister

167
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,640
Send the message to Beijing

168
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
The proposal of five countries jointly administering ShanDong

169
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,280
put forward by President Wilson

170
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
on the conference

171
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
was rejected again by Makino Nobuaki

172
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Britain and France have acquiesced in Japan's proposal.

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,680
America's intervention failed

174
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
Tomorrow

175
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,160
We will make a last-ditch effort at the conference.

176
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
Despite all the efforts and works from the Chinese representative 

177
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,240
that ShanDong shall be returned to China

178
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,280
However, in 1917, the British and French government

179
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,080
supported Japan

180
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
On the grounds of the obligation of signed articles with Japan

181
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,320
The British Prime Minister even said

182
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
If Japan does not join the League of Nations

183
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
Britain will follow

184
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,600
With Italy has withdrawn from the peace conference

185
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
Pushed by his eagerness to establish the League of Nations 

186
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,320
Wilson, American President

187
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,080
who's worried that without three countries among the Big Five,

188
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,400
his scheme wouldn't be accompolished

189
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
Changed his mind and secretly reached an agreement with Japan

190
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
supporting Japan to acquire ShanDong Province

191
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,520
Situation

192
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
Hang by a thread

193
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,920
Smell this, XinGang

194
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,360
The grass is stretching.

195
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,680
The air smells of spring.

196
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
Stop it, stop it.

197
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,920
I feel a little numb when I smell this.

198
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,520
We are in the campus now

199
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,480
We can't be too intimate

200
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
So what?

201
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,040
Spring is coming

202
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
Spring should be like this.

203
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,440
It's not like we are dating behind everyone's back

204
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Now that Yannian left, I do miss him

205
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
Mr. Zhongfu now leaves me in charge of

206
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,760
The delivery and publish of New Youth

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,040
It's all on me

208
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm making real money now

209
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,440
With deep pockets

210
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,640
I can send money to my family

211
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,440
The bitter days have finally come to an end.

212
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
Bailan, I will graduate in three months.

213
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,640
Mr Zhongfu wants me to work at the New Youth

214
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,920
after graduation

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,040
Be a peer editor

216
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,920
and then

217
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
He wants to recommend me to stay as a teaching assistant.

218
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,680
We can settle in Beijing in the future.

219
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
What about the two of us

220
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,360
Didn't you promise to take me back to Qingdao?

221
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,080
Sure

222
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
Not only going back to Qingdao

223
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,960
I'll also take you to the trestle.

224
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
What is the trestle like?

225
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
The trestle is a long bridge.

226
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,080
It was built in the sea.

227
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,680
It goes more than one hundred meters from the seaside.

228
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,920
When there is heavy rain and high tides

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
You mustn't go up there alone.

230
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,720
Otherwise, if you being not careful

231
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,920
you will be caught in the waves.

232
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,880
For real?

233
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,520
Yes

234
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,280
What if I fall in?

235
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,960
I cannot swim

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
Well, in that case

237
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,280
I'll stand on the trestle and laugh

238
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,400
Watching you fluttering in the sea.

239
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,080
You are not gonna save me?

240
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
No

241
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,160
Really?

242
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,120
Really

243
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
You have to flutter in the sea.

244
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,600
to learn how to swim.

245
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,600
You are so mean

246
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
I dare you to not save me

247
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,160
I won't save you.

248
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,960
You have come to Qingdao.

249
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,160
You can't stay not swimming

250
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,880
Something big has happened.

251
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,760
Something big has happened.

252
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,320
what's up

253
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,160
Something bad, really bad

254
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,880


255
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,560
Jianmin Jianmin, wait a minute

256
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,760
Why are you running

257
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Something's wrong in Paris. Shandong is finished.

258
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,240
go

259
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,640
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

260
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,720
XinGang

261
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
Go, go, go, go

262
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,640
Where is justice?

263
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
How can they be this unreasonable?

264
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
A bunch of promise breaking bastards!

265
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,840
I see.

266
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,520
I swore.

267
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
This is outragous

268
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,160
At the Paris Peace Conference yesterday

269
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
Wilson finally delivered a speech.

270
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,080
He's saying that China should accept it's unfortunate faith as it be

271
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
And aproved Japan's plan.

272
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,760
That ShanDong Province will be officially handed over to Japan.

273
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,080
China's diplomacy has completely failed.

274
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
What is going on here?

275
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,440
Didn't you say two days ago?

276
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,360
There's hope that the five countries will govern Shandong?

277
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,880
How can that change in a blink?

278
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,320
What's going on?

279
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,760
Brother Zhongfu

280
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
This is the good man in your words

281
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,400
This is what Wilson did!

282
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,440
This is rogue's behavior!

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,120
Imperialism is all hooligans!

284
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,320
Now!

285
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
It's not the endgame

286
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,760
Maybe there is still room for manoeuvre.

287
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,440
Now we have to do our best.

288
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
To save something

289
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,480
What Peking University can do

290
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
Is to use all platforms and all means.

291
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Speak out loud what is Peking University's attitude to the outside world

292
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,760
Show the society the clear stand of Peking University.

293
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,800
We will never flinch.

294
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,800
To urge the Chinese government and delegation

295
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,480
Take the most effective measures.

296
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,920
To fight for the last time

297
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,760
Shouchang, Zhongfu, we can only rely on you now.

298
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,560
Hurry to publish a special supplement to comment.

299
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,280
We need to act quickly.

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,560
good

301
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,600
Yes

302
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,640
I'm Cai Yuanpei

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,640
Get me Wang Daxie.

304
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,600
By the way, Dong Xiu

305
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,440
I want to take a suit with me.

306
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
You have to prepare two sets.

307
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:39,920
All right

308
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
This time,

309
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,040
there are many speeches and meetings.

310
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,040
Please bring me some more shirts.

311
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
I heard from Junman

312
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
Everyone in Peking University is busy these two days.

313
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,560
Is this a good time for you to go out?

314
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,760
The country and Peking University will be doing just fine without me

315
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,240
But my teacher, Mr Dewey, he is coming to China

316
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
He can't go anywhere without me

317
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
Which matter do you think I should attend to?

318
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,640
This BeiJing is full of shenanigans

319
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,880
Not as peaceful as the countryside.

320
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
You can be have your peace

321
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,000
I told Junman

322
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
asked her to visit you when she is free.

323
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,840
I'm done eating.

324
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,360
I'll help you pack the luggage

325
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,240
good

326
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
The failure of the Paris Peace Conference spread all over the world.

327
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,480


328
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,560


329
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,720


330
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,520
Chinese overseas all felt indignation in their hearts

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:39,680


332
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,160


333
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,240


334
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,080
A large number of Chinese and overseas students poured into Paris.

335
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,080
Support the delegation, also put pressure on them

336
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,560
They gathered around the residence of the Chinese delegation in Paris.

337
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
Ask the delegation to refuse to sign the peace treaty

338
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
Claim to defend ShanDong to the death.

339
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,120
Down with traitors

340
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
Give us back Qingdao!

341
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,200
Return to us ShanDong!

342
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,480
Give us back Qingdao!

343
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,600
Return to us ShanDong!

344
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,720
Down with traitors

345
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,760
We want justice

346
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
We want justice

347
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,680
come on

348
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Let's close all the windows 

349
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
Even if you build a wall

350
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,560
The sound is coming in nevertheless 

351
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Pretend to be an ostrich, bury your head in the sand?

352
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,400
So you are saying

353
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,600
Just open them all

354
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,800
Keep it open.

355
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
It's open. At least we can get some air

356
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,600
Don't you feel these sounds condemning us?

357
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,520
Minister is here

358
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
We have become motherless children.

359
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,280
Everyone, I sent a message to Qian Nengxun.

360
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,480
Request instructions

361
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,080
He said

362
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,200
He can't give it

363
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,200
Asked me to go directly to Xu Shichang.

364
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Okay then, I turned to Xu Shichang.

365
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,440
Still haven't heard back from him

366
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Brother Zixin, what shall we do?

367
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,720
We can't resign and commit suicide altogether

368
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,880
Shaochuan

369
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,800
I really have no idea

370
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,560
I went to Wang Daxie for advice again.

371
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,880
He told me the same thing as yesterday.

372
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,520
He asked us to make a compromise proposal.

373
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,040
Go to Wilson,

374
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,840
Lloyd George,

375
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,640
and Clemenceau

376
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,920
Down with traitors and give me back Qingdao.

377
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
Down with traitors

378
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

379
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
In a blink of an eye, we are traitors.

380
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
Everyone, how can we even look at ourselves now?

381
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
Give your opinion.

382
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
I asked the Guangzhou military junta

383
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,400
The instruction they gave is eight words

384
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,760
Fight to death for every inch and right

385
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
Strong words it is

386
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,240
Every inch of the land

387
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,680
You should ask him though

388
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
How shoudl we fight?

389
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,160
Brother Zixin, it's over.

390
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
I think we can only try Wang daxie's way.

391
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
We cannot be that traitor

392
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,440
sit here and wait for the end of us

393
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,520
Shaochuan

394
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
Wang Daxie made it sounds easy

395
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,320
Compromise. How can we compromise?

396
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
Where is the middle ground?

397
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
Is extremely difficult to negotiate

398
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,320
The word traitor

399
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,800
It's too heavy

400
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
If it goes wrong

401
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
We might as well pick up this title

402
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
with our own hands 

403
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,880
Everyone, as for now

404
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,200
We can't think about personal reputation anymore.

405
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,800
Our country has come to the point of the return

406
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
We have to fight with all we have

407
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720


408
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,720
I shall dedicate myself to the interests of the country in life and death irrespective of personal weal and woe

409
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,280


410
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,280
Exactly

411
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,480
Good point

412
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,480
No space for worry and fear

413
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,000
This is our last duty

414
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,240
Go upstairs now.

415
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
let's go over every detail

416
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320
News! fourteen equals zero.

417
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,880
Wilson invented a new mathematical formula.

418
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,440
Fourteen equals zero.

419
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:49,520


420
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,320
Fourteen equals zero.

421
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,760
Come and see, come and buy.

422
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,120
Fourteen equals zero.

423
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,440
Wilson's newly invented mathematical formula

424
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,240
Shizhi, are you leaving Peking University at this time?

425
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
is it all right?

426
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,840
People will use this against you

427
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,120
Sir, I've been thinking about this too.

428
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
I have to do this

429
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,560
Mr Dewey' visit to China this time

430
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,840
It was decided long ago

431
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
Already arranged.

432
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,320
If I don't go

433
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
There may be some obstacles

434
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,200
Things won't be so smooth.

435
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,760
Unless 

436
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
This visit to China is cancelled

437
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,840
Dewey's visit to China is no small matter.

438
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
However

439
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,560
I have this feeling that something serious will happen to Peking University.

440
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
Don't worry too much, sir.

441
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
It can't be that bad

442
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,600
As long as we know cleary where we stand

443
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,880
We can't count on one Peking University to shake the whole world

444
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,160
It won't be like that

445
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,600
Think about this, Sir

446
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,240
Will Paris Peace Conference take orders from Peking University?

447
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,600
No

448
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,440
All we need to do is to make our attitude clear

449
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,880
and try our best

450
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,600
This is about the fate of the country.

451
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm afraid it's not as simple as you think.

452
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,960
I can tell

453
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
Now your mind is not about Peking University.

454
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,720
That's fine, you can go

455
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,480
Sir

456
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,600
Mr. Shizhi

457
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
I hope you come back as soon as possible

458
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
If something really happens.

459
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,040
I will go and get you back

460
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
I don't have many helpers around me

461
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,680
After You leave, it's only Zhongfu and Shouchang

462
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,520
Three leaders of new culture

463
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,880
but one is missing.

464
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
Won't be as powerfull without you

465
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,800
Sir, do you know what worries me the most?

466
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,320
Speaking of Zhongfu,

467
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
What worries me most is him.

468
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
You know him.

469
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,160
He is over confident and sometimes grumpy

470
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
He tends to go too far when things are tricky

471
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
It might lead to serious problem

472
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
So I invited him to come with me to Shanghai

473
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,760


474
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,280
But he refused

475
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,600
Mr. Shizhi, you are too young

476
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,520
You don't know Zhongfu well enough

477
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
He must be with Shouchang at this moment.

478
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,440
Shizhi

479
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,880
Sir

480
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,560
Go and come back soon

481
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
Don't worry, I will, Sir

482
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Down with traitors and give us back Qingdao.

483
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,200
Rutang

484
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,120
Give me that file you have

485
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,520
Ok

486
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,640
Here

487
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,040
I've always felt that this wording here can be changed

488
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,400
It's better to go with this

489
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,080
Indeed

490
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,720
Isn't it

491
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,280
Do what Shaochuan said.

492
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:01,920
All right

493
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,440
Down with traitors and give us back Shandong.

494
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,720
Give us back Qingdao, give us back Qingdao.

495
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Let's eat first, everyone.

496
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,040
The hotel was blocked by protesters.

497
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
Can't go shopping now

498
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
Let's make do with it.

499
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,920
LaoYue

500
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,200
Later

501
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,360
You have to ask those petitioners at the door to leave

502
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,640
Otherwise, we can't get out.

503
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,000
That'd be impossible

504
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,960
Just today

505
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,640
I met with 16  groups of Chinese representatives

506
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
Those people around the hotel now?

507
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,080
It will only be more of them coming

508
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,640
what shall we do then

509
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,600
I asked the hotel for a car

510
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,440
Only three people can get in except the driver

511
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,240
It's parked in a garage facing the street in the backyard

512
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,760
Quiet area

513
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,360
Few people there, it's safe

514
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,040
So be it

515
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,040
Shaochuan Shaochuan

516
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,120
I can't live without your stinky tofu now

517
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,080
General Lu

518
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,320
Everyone

519
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,400
Everybody!

520
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,160
Chinese delegation to President Wilson of the United States

521
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,040
Prime Minister of the UK

522
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,920
Lloyd George

523
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,640
And French Prime Minister Clemenceau's compromise plan

524
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,600
It's already printed

525
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,120
Come, take a look

526
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,320
We did this with the name of traitor on our head

527
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,200
Four compromise schemes, every detail checked and discussed

528
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,600
If there is no second opinion

529
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,600
Myself, with Shaochuan and Rutang

530
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,520
will visit the heads of the three countries one by one

531
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,920
try to win their sympathy and support

532
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,400
If this scheme can't be accepted

533
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,520
Then I am afraid

534
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,080
We can only wait for the doomsday to come

535
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,520
Shandong Province is the cradle of Chinese civilization

536
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,080
It is the birthplace of Confucius and Mencius

537
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,760
It is a holy place for Chinese people

538
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,040
We hope that through diplomatic means

539
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,040
China's interests can be preserved

540
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,960
Please help us

541
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,800
Nice to see you

542
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,080
A pleasure to meet

543
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,320
me too

544
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:34,720
me too

545
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,760
Nice to see you

546
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,400
Pleasure is mine

547
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,480
General Lu

548
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,280
I have conveyed your message three times

549
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
to President Wilson

550
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
He is not available to meet you tonight

551
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,240
He said that you leave the files

552
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,920
and he will read it later

553
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,600
Then please give this to President Wilson

554
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,600
If there is any doubt

555
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
You can call me anytime

556
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
Please tell him

557
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,480
that tonight

558
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,040
The three of us will stay by the telephone all night

559
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,880
I'll hand it over to the president

560
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,960


561
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,720
Goodbye

562
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,320


563
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,000
Sorry, General Lu

564
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,320
I have conveyed your requests three times already

565
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,680
Unfortunately

566
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,000
Prime Minister Lloyd George

567
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
cannot see you tonight

568
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,960
However

569
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,000
He said you can leave the document

570
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
He will find time to read it carefully

571
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
Then please 

572
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,080
Bring it to Prime Minister 

573
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
No matter what doubts you have

574
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,680
You can call me anytime

575
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,760
Please tell him

576
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,600
The three of us

577
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Will stay up all night tonight

578
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,360
Stay by the phone always

579
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,280
Yes, I understand

580
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,120
I will make sure that the Prime Minister gets the document

581
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,400
General Lu

582
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,120
I have conveyed your messages three times

583
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,000
Regrettably

584
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,800
Prime Minister Clemenceau is not available to meet you tonight

585
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,080


586
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,520
He said please leave the document

587
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,840
He will read it carefully

588
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,160
Then please

589
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,080
Give it to Prime Minister Clemenceau

590
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,600
If he has any question at all

591
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,600
please call me anytime

592
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,200
Please tell him

593
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,320
The three of us

594
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,200
will stay by the telephone all night tonight

595
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,120
Rest assured

596
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,040
We've been Paris this long

597
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,200
I still haven't been to the Arc de Triomphe yet

598
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,560
Do you know what this Arc de Triomphe is for?

599
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
For a state funeral

600
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,320
The funerals of Napoleon and Hugo

601
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,120
Held there

602
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,520
I heard that the French have a motion recently

603
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,880
To have a memorial here

604
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,720
The ever-burning lamp of the unknown martyr who died in the European war

605
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,520
Mr.Zixin, what do you say

606
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,040
Will three of us qualified

607
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,560
to have a funeral here

608
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,000
Buried in the ground or scattered into the water?

609
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,120
I say cremated should do

610
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,360
Shaochuan, let me ask you something

611
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,320
When you first came to Paris

612
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Have you ever thought about how you will be welcomed when going back?

613
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
Mr.Zixin

614
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,680
I once saw it, like a dream

615
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,440
that the Qianmenlouzi in Beijing 

616
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,760
turned into the Arc de Triomphe

617
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,760
And there is us, walking through

618
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
People there waiting for us, cheering up for us

619
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,240
huge crowds of people

620
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,360
The elders, the kids

621
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,000


622
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,520
People singing and dancing

623
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,720
You can hear them shouting out our names

624
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,840
Lu Zhengxiang! Gu Weijun! Wang Zhengting!

625
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
The drums and the gongs, the fircrackers and laughters

626
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,200
That's not all

627
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,040
From the crowd

628
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
A little boy running towards me

629
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,160
He lit a firecracker

630
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,320
A huge one

631
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,800
The bang sound from that one can go on forever

632
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
He threw it close to my feet

633
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,000
It exploded at such close distance

634
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,840
I jumped, trying to avoid it

635
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000


636
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,040
But I couldn't

637
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,880
It hurt, a lot

638
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,480
Then I woke up.

639
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,000
I was there, half awaken for a while

640
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,600
Finally, realized it's no more than a dream

641
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,120
You two

642
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,000
It's all my fault

643
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,760
I got you into trouble.

644
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,600
it is me.

645
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,000
I took your Arc de Triomphe

646
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,000
turned it to a pillar of shame

647
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,320
I'm sorry

648
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,400
I'm sorry

649
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
So sorry

650
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
April 30th, 1919

651
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,120
U.S., Britain and France hold trilateral meeting in Paris.

652
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,000
Japanese representatives were invited to attend.

653
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,880
This meeting set the final terms for

654
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,040
Provisions on the ShanDong issue discussed on the Paris Peace Conference

655
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,320
The three great power finally made a decision

656
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,200
Agreed that all the rights and interests of Germany in Shandong

657
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,240


658
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,000
will be transfered to Japan

659
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,480
China

660
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
We are the ones that won this war

661
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,120
And all we got is a treaty like this?

662
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,480
A treaty that disgraces the country?

663
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
This is a disgrace to mankind

664
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,720
It is an unprecedented shame

665
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Our Chinese government

666
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,840
refuse to accept this.

667
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,400
This shameful peace treaty

668
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm Wang Daxie.

669
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,280
We lost ShanDong

670
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,400
Chen lu

671
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,200
You are the acting foreign minister.

672
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,640
Are you gonna just cry at time like this?

673
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,920
What the hell happened?

674
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,200
Make it clear to me.

675
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,720
Shandong is lost.

676
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,160
We lost. We lost completely.

677
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,200
We became the one lost now 

678
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,400
You and I, we will never be able to face our people again
