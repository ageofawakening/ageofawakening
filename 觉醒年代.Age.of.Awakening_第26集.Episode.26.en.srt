and Clemenceau.

374
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,920
Down with traitors! Give us back Qingdao!

375
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
Down with traitors!

376
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

377
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
In a blink of an eye, we are traitors.

378
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
Everyone, how can we even look at ourselves now?

379
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
Give your opinion.

380
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
I asked our Guangzhou warlord government,

381
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,400
the instruction they gave is eight words:

382
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,760
fight to death for every inch of land.

383
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
Strong words, they are.

384
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,240
Every inch of the land.

385
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,680
You should ask him though.

386
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
How should we fight?

387
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,160
Brother Zixin, it's over.

388
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
I think we can only try Wang Daxie's way.

389
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
We cannot be the traitor

390
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,440
that sits here and waits for the end.

391
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,520
Shaochuan.

392
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
Wang Daxie made it sounds easy.

393
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,320
Compromise. How can we compromise?

394
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
The middle ground

395
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
is extremely difficult to grasp.

396
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,320
The word traitor

397
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,800
is too heavy.

398
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
If it goes wrong,

399
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
we might as well pick up this title

400
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
with our own hands.

401
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,880
Everyone, as for now,

402
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,200
we can't think about personal reputation anymore.

403
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,800
Our country has come to the point of the return.

404
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
We have to fight with all we have.

405
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
I dedicate myself to the interests of the country,

406
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,280
in life and death irrespective of personal weal and woe.

407
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,280
Exactly!

408
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,480
Good!

409
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,480
No space for worry and fear.

410
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,000
This is our last duty.

411
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,240
Go upstairs now.

412
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
Let's go over every detail.

413
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320

Wilson's newly invented mathematical formula!

420
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,240
Shizhi, are you leaving Peking University at this time?

421
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
Is it alright?

422
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,840
People will use this against you.

423
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,120
Sir, I've been thinking about this too.

424
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
I have to do this.

425
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,560
Mr. Dewey's visit to China this time

426
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,840
was decided long ago.

427
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
It has already been arranged.

428
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,320
If I don't go,

429
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
there may be some obstacles.

430
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,200
Things won't be so smooth.

431
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,760
Unless,

432
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
his visit to China is cancelled.

433
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,840
Dewey's visit to China is no small matter.

434
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
However,

435
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,560
I have this feeling that something serious will happen to Peking University.

436
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
Don't worry too much, sir.

437
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
It can't be that bad.

438
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,600
As long as we know clearly where we stand,

439
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,880
we can't count on one Peking University

440
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,160
to shake the whole world.

441
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,600
Think about this, Sir.

442
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,240
Will Paris Peace Conference take orders from Peking University?

443
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,600
No.

444
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,440
All we need to do is to make our attitude clear

445
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,880
and try our best.

446
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,600
This is about the fate of the country.

447
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm afraid it's not as simple as you think.

448
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,960
I can tell.

449
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
Now your mind is not about Peking University.

450
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,720
That's fine, you can go.

451
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,480
Sir.

452
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,600
Mr. Shizhi.

453
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
I hope you come back as soon as possible.

454
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
If something really happens,

455
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,040
I will go and get you back.

456
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
I don't have many helpers around me.

457
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,680
After you leave, it's only Zhongfu and Shouchang.

458

460
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
It won't be as powerful without you.

461
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,800
Sir, do you know what worries me the most?

462
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,320
Speaking of Zhongfu,

463
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
what worries me most is him.

464
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
You know him.

465
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,160
He is over confident and sometimes grumpy.

466
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
He tends to go too far when things are tricky.

467
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
It might lead to serious problems.

468
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
So I invited him

469
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,760
to come with me to Shanghai.

470

But he refused.

471

Mr. Shizhi, you are too young.

472
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,520
You don't know Zhongfu well enough.

473
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
He must be with Shouchang at this moment.

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,880

476
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,560
Go and come back soon.

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,720
I bid you goodbye, sir.

559
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,320
And I bid you goodbye.

560
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,000
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

561
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:34,509
[U.K. Delegation Residence, Paris]

562
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,320
I have conveyed your requests three times already.

563
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,680
Unfortunately,

564
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,000
the Prime Minister Lloyd George

565
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
cannot see you tonight.

566
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,960
However,

567
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,000
he said you can leave the document

568
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
and he will find time to read it carefully.

569
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
Then please,

570
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,080
bring it to the Prime Minister.

571
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
No matter what doubts you have,

572
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,680
you can call me anytime.

573
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,760
Please tell him,

574
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,600
the three of us

575
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
will stay up all night tonight

576
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,360
staying by the phone.

577
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,280
Yes, I understand that

578
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,120
I will make sure that the Prime Minister gets the document.

579
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,400
I'm sorry, Chief Lu.

580
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,120
I have conveyed your messages for the third time.

581
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,000
Regrettably,

582
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,800
Prime Minister Clemenceau is not available to meet you tonight.

583
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,080
However, he said

584
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,520
to leave the document here

585
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,840
and he will take the time to read it carefully.

586
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,160
Then please,

587
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,080
give it to Prime Minister Clemenceau.

588
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,600
If he has any question at all,

589
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,600
please call me anytime.

590
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,200
Please tell him,

591
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,320
The three of us

592
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,200
will stay by the telephone all night tonight.

593
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,120
No problem.

594
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,040
We've been Paris this long,

595
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,200
I still haven't been to the Arc de Triomphe yet.

596
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,560
Do you know what this Arc de Triomphe is for?

597
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
For a state funeral.

598
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,320
The funerals of Napoleon and Hugo

599
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,120
held there in those days.

600
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,520
I heard that the French have a motion recently,

601
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,880
to have a memorial there:

602
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,720
an ever-burning lamp of the unknown soldier who died in the war.

603
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,520
Brother Zixin, what do you say?

604
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,040
Will three of us qualified

605
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,560
to have a funeral there?

606
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,000
Buried in the ground or scattered into the water?

607
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,120
I say cremated should do.

608
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,360
Shaochuan, let me ask you something.

609
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,320
When you first came to Paris,

610
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
have you ever thought about how you will be welcomed when going back?

611
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
Brother Zixin,

612
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,680
I once saw it, like a dream

613
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,440
that the Qianmenlouzi in Beijing

614
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,760
turned into the Arc de Triomphe.

615
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,760
And there is us, walking through.

616
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
People there waiting for us, cheering up for us.

617
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,240
Huge crowds of people.

618
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,360
The elders, the kids.

619
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
People singing and dancing.

620
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,720
You can hear them shouting out our names.

621
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,840
Lu Zhengxiang! Gu Weijun! Wang Zhengting!

622
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
The drums and the gongs, the fircrackers and laughters.

623
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,200
That's not all.

624
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,040
From the crowd,

625
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
a little boy running towards me.

626
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,160
He lit a firecracker.

627
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,320
A huge one.

628
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,800
The bang sound from that one can go on forever.

629
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
He threw it close to my feet.

630
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,000
It exploded at such close distance.

631
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,840
I jumped, trying to avoid it.

632
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
Bam, bam, bam!

633
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,040
But I couldn't.

634
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,880
It hurt, a lot.

635
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,480
Then I woke up.

636
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,000
I was there, half awaken for a while.

637
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,600
Finally, realized it's no more than a dream.

638
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,120
You two.

639
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,000
It's all my fault.

640
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,760
I got you into trouble.

641
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,600
It's me.

642
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,000
I took your Arc de Triomphe

643
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,000
and turned it to a pillar of shame.

644
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,320
I'm sorry.

645
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,400
I'm sorry.

646
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
So sorry.

647
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
On April 30th, 1919,

648
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,120
the United States, the United Kingdom and France held a trilateral meeting in Paris.

649
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,000
Japanese representatives were invited to attend.

650
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,880
This meeting set the final terms for

651
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,040
the provisions on the Shandong issue discussed on the Paris Peace Conference.

652
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,320
The three great powers finally made a decision.

653
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,240
They agreed that all the rights and interests of Germany in Shandong

654
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,000
will be transfered to Japan.

655
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,480
China,

656
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
a victorious country,

657
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,120
and all we got is a treaty like this?

658
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,480
A treaty that disgraces the country?

659
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
This is a disgrace to mankind.

660
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,720
It is an unprecedented shame.

661
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Our Chinese government

662
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,840
refuse to accept this.

663
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,400
This shameful peace treaty.

664
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm Wang Daxie.

665
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,280
We lost Shandong.

666
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:03,668
[Wang Daxie, styled Botang, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Republic of China]

667
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,400
Chen Lu.

668
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,200
You are the acting foreign minister.

669
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,640
Are you gonna just cry at a time like this?

670
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,920
What the hell happened?

671
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,200
Make it clear to me.

672
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,720
Shandong is lost.

673
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,160
We lost. We lost completely.

674
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,200
We became the ones lost now.

675
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,400
You and I, will never be able to face our people again.
