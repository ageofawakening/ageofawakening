[Episode Twenty-six]

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,440
My brother steals food.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,720
Tell him not to steal food.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,080
Wait till dad comes back.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,200
dad came back

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,160
Come over for dinner

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,360
Dad, come and eat.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,200
Come back

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,800
Just wash your hands and eat.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,320
Don't eat

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,720
Don't eat

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,920
Angry again

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,880
not have

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,400
Something happened at school.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,680
not have

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,960
Let's eat then.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,920
Don't eat

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,760
If you don't eat, the children have to eat.

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
If you don't eat, they won't eat.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,040
What are you afraid of?

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,600
Zihe Nian

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,040
If you are hungry, eat first.

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,080
Don't wait for me.

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,240
Don't wait for me.

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,720
Make me look like a feudal parent.

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,320
Why?

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,760
Don't bother me with writing.

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
You are not a feudal parent.

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,840
Who is the feudal patriarch?

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,520
eat

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,520
Dad, come and eat.

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,400
Dad, come and eat.

34
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,400
sit down

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,480
Special package of vegetables and egg stuffing for you.

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,760
Wilson's intervention

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,880
Temporarily hindered

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
Japan seeks the promotion of Shandong rights plan.

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,480
But in Italian Prime Minister Orlando

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,400
The day after the meeting.

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
Japan represents Makino Nobuaki.

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
Lose no time in speaking suddenly.

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,240
Insist on his terms.

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,000
Solve the Shandong problem

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
Otherwise, Japan will refuse to sign the peace treaty.

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
And quit the Paris Peace Conference.

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
The situation has turned sharply.

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,680
Beijing Foreign Affairs Committee of the Republic of China

49
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,680
Chairman Wang

50
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,800
America, Britain, France, Italy and Japan

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,400
Two meetings are being held.

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
Discuss the Shandong issue in China

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,480
The request of Chinese representatives to attend the meeting has been rejected.

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
From last night until now.

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,240
I waited three times to ask for a meeting with Will.

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
Lloyd George

57
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,160
Monso can't even see him.

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,320
Please inform the countermeasures quickly.

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
cabinet minister

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
Do you want any more phenol in this message?

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,200


62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,360
What else do you want?

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,920
What else to drink?

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,240
What else do you want?

65
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,320


66
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,960
Send it now. Go

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,360
ladies and gentlemen

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,840
We are at the end of our tether now.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
There is only one word left.

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,600
wait for

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
Son, don't worry.

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,400
take a break

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm the ant on hot bricks now.

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
I don't know if I climb to Naer to survive.

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
Can there be no hurry?

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,800
understand

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,720
You should take care of yourself.

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,160
If you break down

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,320
More trouble

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
Chief Beijing reply message

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,840
read

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,760
Turn to President Wilson at all costs.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,680
Shameless!

84
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
Let's divide our troops into five ways.

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
Go to the four exits of the conference room respectively.

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
And the elevator entrance in the basement, Tan Shou

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,240
Whoever met Wilson

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,920
Stop him anyway.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
And inform me quickly.

90
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,360
Let's do it

91
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,080
Go!

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,160
ladies and gentlemen

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,520
Block the door.

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
Diplomacy can do this.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,800
What kind of diplomacy is this?

96
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Dear President Wilson

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
Please help us.

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
Help us China no matter what.

99
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,200
Gu xiansheng

100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,040
I'll tell you frankly.

101
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
My second proposal.

102
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,920
It was just rejected again.

103
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,960
President Wilson

104
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,720
Fourteen peace proposals put forward by you

105
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
Has become a household name in China.

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,120
Hundreds of millions of Chinese

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,920
Are eagerly looking forward to it

108
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
Your axiom can overcome power.

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
I didn't give up justice.

110
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,840
But now I'm not only going out.

111
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,880
There's nothing I can do.

112
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,200
President Wilson, you are capable.

113
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
We fully believe that

114
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
And relying on American influence.

115
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,800
Chief Lu

116
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,680
I borrow a word from you Chinese.

117
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,440
Why should I have known today?

118
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Without you, chief Lu

119
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,040
At the beginning of the 21.

120
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
Without Zhang Zongxiang's handwritten copy

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,440
Agree readily

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,400
I think no matter what

123
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,360
There will be no such situation as today.

124
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
Mr.president

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Is there no hope?

126
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
There is no hope to see tomorrow.

127
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,480
Your own efforts at the conference

128
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Is your last hope.

129
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
Goodbye, gentlemen.

130
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
Don't work hard, Chuan.

131
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,760
How's the preparation going?

132
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
What a mess!

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,440
Zixiong

134
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,720
Do you think there is any hope for us?

135
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,640
hope

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Treat a dead horse as a living horse.

137
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Even dying.

138
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,320
Have a try, too, right?

139
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,200
Chuan, you have to understand

140
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,680
This speech of yours

141
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,280
Is our last hope for self-help.

142
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,160
Please

143
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,120
Zixiong

144
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,080
Today I'm Ming Zi.

145
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,480
Why since the Republic of China

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
There will be so many committed suicide.

147
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
Chuan, I know.

148
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
I put you on the spot.

149
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,400
If I hadn't read it by heart

150
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,160
Article 21 Charge of signature

151
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,760
Tomorrow's conference

152
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
I will never let you rush to the front.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,360
come

154
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,080
you see

155
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,520
I found your favorite stinky tofu.

156
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,520
Stinky tofu with bread combines Chinese and western.

157
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,280
Zixiong

158
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,840
You have a heart.

159
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,480
Don't worry, I won't back down.

160
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
There's still some time for me to get ready.

161
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,200
Shaochuan

162
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,440
I represent thousands of Chinese.

163
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
thank you

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
Or this fragrance?

165
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,920
messenger

166
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,480
cabinet minister

167
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,640
Generate electricity for Beijing

168
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
Premier Qian Wilson, President

169
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,280
Put forward at the conference

170
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
Proposal of five countries jointly administering Shandong, China

171
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
Was rejected again by Ben Mu Ye.

172
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Britain and France have acquiesced in Japan's proposal.

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,680
American spin failure

174
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll wait tomorrow.

175
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Will make a last-ditch effort at the conference.

176
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
Although the Chinese representative argued for it

177
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,240
Request to return to Shandong

178
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,280
However, in 1917, Britain and France

179
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,080
On the grounds of the obligation to sign a contract with Japan

180
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
Support Japan

181
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,320
The British Prime Minister even said

182
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
If Japan does not join the League of Nations

183
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
When Britain followed

184
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,600
Considering that Italy has withdrawn from the peace conference

185
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
Be eager to facilitate at the peace meeting

186
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,320
Wilson, American President who founded the League of Nations.

187
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,080
I am afraid that the top five will go to the third and I will fail.

188
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,400
It was secretly reached in Japan.

189
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
Change one's original reservation

190
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
Support Japan to acquire Shandong

191
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,520
situation

192
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
hang by a thread

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,360
The grass is stretching.

195
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,680
The air smells of spring.

196
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
Stop it, stop it.

197
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,920
I feel a little numb when I smell this.

198
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,520
We are in school.

199
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,480
Be careful.

200
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
At school. Why?

201
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,040
Spring is coming

202
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
Spring should be like this.

203
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,440
We are above board.

204
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
As soon as Yannian left: I really want to.

205
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
Mr. Zhongfu now puts

206
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,760
The delivery of New Youth

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,040
Leave it all to me.

208
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,320
I have earned money now.

209
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,440
But with deep pockets

210
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,640
I have sent money to my family.

211
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,440
The bitter days have finally come to an end.

212
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
I will graduate from Lan in three months.

213
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,640
After graduation, Mr. Zhongfu told me

214
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,920
He asked me to go to New Youth.

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,040
Be a peer editor

216
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,920
and then

217
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
He wants to recommend me to stay as a teaching assistant.

218
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,680
We can settle in Beijing in the future.

219
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
What about the two of us

220
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,360
Didn't you promise to take me back to Qingdao?

221
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,080
Huiya

222
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
Not only going back to Qingdao

223
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,960
I'll also take you to the trestle.

224
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
What is the trestle like?

225
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
The trestle is a long bridge.

226
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,080
It was built in the sea.

227
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,680
It's more than one hundred meters from the seaside.

228
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,920
Then wait until the wind and waves are rough.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
You mustn't go up there alone.

230
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,720
Otherwise, be careful!

231
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,920
I was caught in the waves.

232
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,880
real

233
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,520
Yes

234
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,280
What if I fall in?

235
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,960
I cannot swim

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
You can't swim and fall in.

237
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,280
Then I'll stand on the trestle and watch you laugh.

238
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,400
Look at you fluttering in the sea.

239
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Don't you save me?

240
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
Do not save

241
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,160
You really don't save me.

242
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,120
True salvation

243
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
You have to flutter in the sea.

244
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,600
You can learn to swim.

245
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,600
Why are you so bad?

246
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
Dare you save me? Are you sure you don't save me?

247
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,160
I won't save you.

248
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,960
You have come to Qingdao.

249
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,160
How can you swim if you can't?

250
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,880
Something big has happened.

251
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,760
Something big has happened.

252
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,320
what's up

253
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,160
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

254
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,880
Something big has happened.

255
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,560
Jianmin Jianmin, wait a minute

256
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,760
Run what?

257
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Something's wrong in Paris. Shandong is finished.

258
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,240
go

259
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,640
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

260
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,720
新港

261
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
Go, go, go, go

262
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,640
What is the reason for this?

263
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
How can this be unreasonable?

264
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
Aren't you a reneging bastard?

265
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,840
I see.

266
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,520
I swore.

267
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
go too far in bullying others

268
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,160
At the conference of Paris Peace Conference yesterday

269
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
Wilson finally delivered a speech.

270
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,080
He actually made us China feel unlucky.

271
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
And agreed to Japan's plan.

272
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,760
China's Shandong should be officially handed over to Japan.

273
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,080
China's diplomacy has completely failed.

274
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
What is going on here?

275
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,440
Didn't you say two days ago?

276
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,360
Is there any hope that the five countries will govern Shandong?

277
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,880
Why did you turn around and change?

278
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,320
What's going on?

279
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,760
中富兄

280
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
This is the first good person in your heart.

281
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,400
What Wilson did

282
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,440
This is a rogue!

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,120
Imperialism is all hooligans.

284
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,320
Now!

285
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
It's not the last time yet.

286
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,760
Maybe there is still room for manoeuvre.

287
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,440
Now we have to do our best.

288
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
To save this defeat.

289
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,480
What Peking University can do.

290
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
Is to use all platforms and means.

291
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Show the voice of Peking University to the outside world.

292
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,760
Show the society the clear attitude of Peking University.

293
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,800
We will never flinch.

294
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,800
To urge the Chinese government and delegation

295
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,480
Take the most effective measures.

296
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,920
To fight for the last time

297
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,760
Shouchang Zhongfu can only rely on you now.

298
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,560
Hurry to publish a special supplement to comment.

299
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,280
We need to act quickly.

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,560
good

301
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,600
nicely

302
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,640
I'm Cai Yuanpei

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,640
Get me Wang Daxie.

304
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,600
By the way, Dong Xiu

305
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,440
I want to take a suit with me.

306
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
You have to prepare two sets.

307
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:39,920
good

308
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
Go this time.

309
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,040
There are many speeches and meetings.

310
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,040
Please bring me some more shirts.

311
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
My sister-in-law Junman said

312
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
Peking University will be so busy these two days.

313
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,560
Is this a good time for you to go out?

314
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,760
I can do things with National Peking University without me.

315
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,240
But my teacher, Mr Dewey, came to China.

316
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
He can't move without me.

317
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
Which head do you think I care about?

318
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,640
This city is full of things.

319
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,880
Not as clean as the countryside.

320
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
You can be quiet.

321
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,000
I told Junman's sister-in-law

322
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
Let her visit you more often when she is free.

323
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,840
I'm done eating.

324
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,360
I'll help you pack the season first.

325
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,240
good

326
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
The failure of the Paris Peace Conference spread all over the world.

327
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,480
Overseas Chinese are filled with indignation

328
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,560


329
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,720
Overseas Chinese are filled with indignation.

330
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,520
Overseas Chinese customary filling

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:39,680
An overseas Chinese filled with indignation.

332
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,160
Overseas Chinese are filled with indignation.

333
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,240


334
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,080
A large number of Chinese, overseas Chinese and overseas students poured into Paris.

335
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,080
Support the delegation and put pressure on it.

336
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,560
They gathered around the residence of the Chinese delegation in Paris.

337
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
Ask the delegation to refuse to sign the peace treaty

338
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
Claim to defend Shandong to the death.

339
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,120
Down with traitors

340
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
Give me back to Qingdao

341
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,200
Return me to Shandong.

342
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,480
Give me back to Qingdao

343
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,600
Give me back to Qingdao

344
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,720
Down with traitors

345
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,760
Give me justice.

346
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
Give me justice.

347
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,680
come on

348
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Let's close all the windows together.

349
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
Even if you build a wall

350
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,560
This sound should come in and have to come in.

351
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Isn't that a dry bird with its head buried in the sand?

352
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,400
What do you mean?

353
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,600
Just open them all.

354
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,800
Keep it open.

355
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
It's open. At least we can get some air

356
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,600
Don't you think the sound hurts?

357
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,520
Total length

358
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
We have become motherless children.

359
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,280
Everyone, I send a message to Qian Nengxun.

360
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,480
Request instructions

361
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,080
And he called back and said

362
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,200
He can't do it either.

363
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,200
Let me go directly to Xu Shichang.

364
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Okay, I'll go find Xu Shichang.

365
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,440
As a result, I haven't waited for his call back until now.

366
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Brother Xin, what shall we do?

367
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,720
You can't resign and commit suicide collectively.

368
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,880
Shaona

369
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,800
I really can't help it.

370
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,560
I went to Wang Daxie for advice again.

371
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,880
He did the same thing yesterday.

372
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,520
He asked us to make a compromise proposal.

373
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,040
Go to Wilson.

374
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,840
Lloyd George

375
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,640
He ke Li Meng suo

376
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,920
Down with traitors and give me back Qingdao.

377
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
Down with traitors

378
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

379
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
In a blink of an eye, we are traitors.

380
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
How should you treat yourself?

381
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
Give your opinion.

382
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
I asked our Guangzhou military government.

383
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,400
The instruction is eight words.

384
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,760
Sovereignty is paramount, and every inch of land must be contested.

385
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
That's very nice.

386
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,240
fight for/contest every inch of land

387
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,680
You should ask him.

388
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
How to fight?

389
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,160
Brother Xin, it's over.

390
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
I think I can only try it Wang Tianxie's way.

391
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
We can't be a group.

392
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,440
A traitor waiting for death.

393
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,520
Shaona

394
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
Wang Daxie is easy to say.

395
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,320
Compromise. How can we compromise?

396
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
The scale and discretion in the middle

397
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
Is extremely difficult to grasp.

398
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,320
The word traitor

399
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,800
It's heavy

400
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
Maybe.

401
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
We will take this title ourselves.

402
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
Sit tight.

403
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,880
I thought now

404
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,200
We can't think about personal reputation anymore.

405
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,800
At this time of the country

406
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
We have to fight hard.

407
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
Gouguojia lives and dies.

408
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,280
Ba avoids the trend because of misfortune and blessing.

409
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,280
Good point!

410
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,480
good

411
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,480
Don't worry any more.

412
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's say it's the final act.

413
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,240
Go upstairs now.

414
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
Discuss one by one.

415
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320
Extra number fourteen equals zero.

416
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,880
Wilson invented a new mathematical formula.

417
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,440
Fourteen equals zero.

418
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:49,520


419
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,320
Fourteen equals zero.

420
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,760
Come and see, come and buy.

421
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,120
Fourteen equals zero.

422
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,440
Wilson's newly invented mathematical formula

423
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,240
Shizhi, are you leaving Peking University at this time?

424
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
is it all right

425
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,840
It's easy to give orders.

426
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,120
Sir, I've been thinking about this too.

427
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
As a last resort.

428
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,560
Mr Dewey, the schedule of his visit to China this time

429
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,840
It was decided long ago.

430
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
It's already arranged.

431
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,320
If I don't go

432
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
There may be some things

433
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,200
It won't be so smooth.

434
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,760
Unless that's

435
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
He canceled his visit to China this time.

436
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,840
Dewey's visit to China is no small matter.

437
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
But in my heart

438
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,560
Always worried that something big will happen to Peking University.

439
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
Don't worry too much, sir.

440
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
Nothing big will happen.

441
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,600
As long as we put ourselves in the right position.

442
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,880
Don't think you have Peking University.

443
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,160
You can beat the world.

444
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,600
Miss sir

445
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,240
Paris Peace Conference. Will it listen to Peking University?

446
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,600
won't.

447
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,440
As long as we show our attitude.

448
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,880
Just try your best

449
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,600
This is about the fate of the country.

450
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm afraid it's not as simple as you think.

451
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,960
I see

452
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
Now your mind is no longer in Peking University.

453
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,720
Okay, you go.

454
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,480
sir

455
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,600
史鸷先生

456
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
I hope you can go and come back early.

457
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
If something really happens.

458
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,040
I'm still going to bring you back.

459
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
I don't have any helpers around me.

460
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,680
You're gone, leaving Zhongfu and Shouchang alone.

461
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,520
The main force of your new culture.

462
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,880
One is missing.

463
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
This strength is small.

464
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,800
Sir, do you know what worries me the most?

465
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,320
Speaking of Zhongfu,

466
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
What worries me most is him.

467
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
You know him.

468
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,160
Always just doing things for personal use, grumpy

469
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
Things are easy to go to extremes.

470
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
Maybe they'll catch you.

471
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
So I went to Shanghai this time.

472
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,760
I asked him to go with me.

473
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,280
But he didn't want to go

474
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,600
Mr. Shizhi, you are still young

475
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,520
You don't know Zhongfu

476
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
He must be with Shouchang at this moment.

477
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,440
史鸷啊

478
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,880
sir

479
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,560
Go early and return early.

480
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
Don't worry, sir. I'll be there early.

481
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Down with traitors and give me back Qingdao.

482
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,200
Rutang

483
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,120
Give me the file in your hand.

484
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,520
good

485
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,640
give

486
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,040
I've always felt that his wording

487
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,400
It's better to go to this.

488
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,080
It should be on this.

489
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,720
Isn't it

490
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,280
Do what Shaochuan said.

491
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:01,920
nicely

492
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,440
Down with traitors and give me back Shandong.

493
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,720
Give me back Qingdao, give me back Qingdao.

494
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Let's eat first, everyone.

495
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,040
The hotel was blocked by protesters.

496
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
Can't go shopping now

497
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
Let's make do with it.

498
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,920
Yuea

499
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,200
a little while

500
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,360
You have to get rid of those petitioners at the door

501
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,640
Otherwise, we can't get out.

502
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,000
I can't get it out.

503
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,960
Today is my day.

504
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,640
I received 16 Chinese representatives.

505
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
Where are the people around the hotel now?

506
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,080
It's increasing, not decreasing.

507
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,640
what to do then

508
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,600
I contacted the hotel for a car.

509
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,440
There are only three people except the driver.

510
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,240
This car is parked in the garage facing the street in the backyard.

511
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,760
Which place is partial?

512
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,360
Nobody is absolutely safe.

513
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,040
be it so

514
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,040
Shaochuan Shaochuan

515
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,120
I can't live without your stinky tofu

516
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,080
Chief Lu

517
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,320
everyone

518
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,400
Everybody!

519
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,160
Chinese delegation to President Wilson of the United States

520
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,040
Prime Minister of the UK

521
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,920
Lloyd George

522
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,640
And French Prime Minister Clemenceau's compromise plan.

523
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,600
It's already printed.

524
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,120
come to see

525
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,320
But we're risking a big crime.

526
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,200
Four compromise schemes discussed one by one.

527
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,600
What if everyone has no objection?

528
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,600
I follow Shaochuan Confucianism.

529
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,520
Visit the heads of the three countries one by one.

530
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,920
Win their sympathy and support.

531
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,400
If this scheme is not acceptable

532
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,520
Then we can only

533
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,080
Wait for death.

534
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,520
Shandong Province is the cradle of Chinese civilization.

535
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,080
It is the birthplace of Confucius and Mencius.

536
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,760
It is a holy place for Chinese people.

537
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,040
We hope that through diplomatic means

538
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,040
Preserve China's interests

539
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,960
Please help us.

540
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,800
Nice to see you.

541
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,080
be pleased to meet

542
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,320
me too

543
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:34,720
me too

544
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,760
Nice to see you.

545
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,400
be pleased to meet

546
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,480
Chief Lu

547
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,280
I have told President Wilson for the third time.

548
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
I conveyed your meaning.

549
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
The president really doesn't have time to talk to you tonight.

550
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,240
He said please leave the documents.

551
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,920
He must arrange time to read carefully.

552
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,600
Then please give this to President Wilson.

553
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,600
If there is any doubt

554
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
You can call me anytime.

555
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
Please tell him.

556
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,480
Just say tonight.

557
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,040
The three of us will stay by the telephone all night.

558
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,880
I'll hand it over to the president.

559
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,960
see you again

560
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,720
see you again

561
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,320
see you again

562
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,000
Sorry, Chief Lu.

563
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,320
I have conveyed your meaning for the third time.

564
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,680
regrettably

565
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,000
Prime Minister Lloyd George

566
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
I really have no time to talk to you tonight.

567
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,960
but

568
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,000
He said please leave the documents.

569
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
He must arrange time to read carefully.

570
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
Then please put this

571
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,080
Give it to Prime Minister Lloyd George.

572
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
No matter what doubts you have

573
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,680
You can call me anytime.

574
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,760
Please tell him.

575
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,600
Just the three of us.

576
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Will stay up all night tonight.

577
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,360
Stay by the phone all the time

578
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,280
OK, I see

579
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,120
I will make sure that the Prime Minister receives this document.

580
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,400
Chief Lu

581
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,120
I have conveyed your meaning for the third time.

582
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,000
regrettably

583
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,800
Prime Minister Monso

584
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,080
I really have no time to talk to you tonight.

585
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,520
He said please leave the documents.

586
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,840
He must arrange time to read carefully.

587
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,160
Then please put this

588
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,080
Give it to Prime Minister Clemenceau.

589
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,600
If he has any questions

590
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,600
You can call me anytime.

591
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,200
Please tell him.

592
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,320
Just the three of us.

593
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,200
I will stay by the telephone all night tonight.

594
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,120
don't worry

595
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,040
Come to Paris for so long

596
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,200
Haven't been to the Arc de Triomphe yet.

597
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,560
Do you know what this Arc de Triomphe is?

598
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
For holding a state funeral

599
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,320
The funerals of Napoleon and Hugo

600
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,120
Held here.

601
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,520
I heard that the French have a motion recently.

602
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,880
To light the memorial here.

603
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,720
The ever-burning lamp of the unknown martyr who died in the European war

604
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,520
Son, you said the three of us

605
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,040
Not qualified

606
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,560
Have a funeral here.

607
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,000
You said this burial or water burial?

608
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,120
Otherwise, we'll be cremated.

609
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,360
Chuan, let me ask you something.

610
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,320
When you first came to Paris

611
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Have you ever thought about how to get back?

612
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
Zixiong

613
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,680
I once saw it suddenly.

614
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,440
Beijing's Qianmenlouzi

615
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,760
Into the arc de Triomphe.

616
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,760
How many of us went through the door?

617
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
People are jubilant!

618
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,240
huge crowds of people

619
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,360
There are old people and children.

620
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,000
There's a song twirling in the imperial boat.

621
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,520
There are yangko dances for rowing dry boats.

622
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,720
People are cheering our names!

623
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,840
Gu Weijun, Wang Zhengting

624
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
The drums and firecrackers exploded.

625
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,200
At this time

626
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,040
Inside this crowd.

627
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
A little boy ran out.

628
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,160
He also lit a firecracker.

629
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,320
Hang firecrackers.

630
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,800
Not to mention a thousand, there are 800.

631
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
I lit it and threw it under my feet.

632
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,000
Blow up! Blow up around me!

633
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,840
I'll just hide left and right.

634
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
Fried mouth

635
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,040
The firecracker skin cracked me.

636
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,880
That hurts.

637
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,480
Then I woke up.

638
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm slow for half a day.

639
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,600
It's just a dream to find out.

640
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,120
Two places

641
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm sorry

642
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,760
I got you into trouble.

643
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,600
it is me.

644
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,000
Put your arc de Triomphe

645
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,000
Become a pillar of shame.

646
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,320
I'm sorry

647
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,400
I'm sorry

648
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
Sorry sorry

649
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
April 30th, 1919

650
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,120
U.S., Britain and France hold trilateral meeting in Paris.

651
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,000
Japanese representatives were invited to attend.

652
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,880
The meeting agreed on the Paris Peace Conference.

653
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,040
Provisions on the Shandong issue

654
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,320
Britain and France finally made a decision.

655
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,200
Agree to all the rights and interests of Germany in Shandong

656
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,240
Agree to all the rights and interests of Germany in Shandong

657
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,000
Transfer to Japan

658
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,480
China

659
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
As a victorious country

660
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,120
You deserve one like this

661
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,480
A treaty that disgraces the country?

662
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
This is a disgrace to mankind.

663
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,720
It is an unprecedented shame.

664
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Our Chinese government

665
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,840
Accept this.

666
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,400
Shameful peace treaty

667
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm Wang Daxie.

668
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,280
Boshan is lost.

669
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,400
Chen zhuan

670
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,200
You are acting foreign minister.

671
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,640
Why are you crying at this time?

672
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,920
What the hell happened?

673
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,200
Make it clear to me.

674
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,720
Shandong is lost.

675
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,160
We lost. We lost completely.

676
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,200
Now it's a loser.

677
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,400
How can I treat my countrymen?
