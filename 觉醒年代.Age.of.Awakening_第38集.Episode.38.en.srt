00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,071
[Episode Thirty-eight]

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,320
Given the current potential danger of this career,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
all names of members in the club

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,360
will remain hidden from the public.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,040
So, we will draw from the pool

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
to give each one a number

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,240
as a code for communication,

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,440
also as the pseudonym.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,880
There are fifty notes on the table now.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,880
A number is written on each note.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,480
The number you drew

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
is your future correspondence code and pen name.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,720
Let's start now.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,360
I got 36

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
Then I will be called Shanlu from now on.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm number one. My name is Yihao.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,120
I'm number five

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,200
I will be Wuhao.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,240
Comrades

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
The first activity organized by this enlightenment society 

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
is to invite Professor Li Dazhao from Peking University

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
Cto here and give us lectures, guidance.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,560
Professor Li is the instructor of the May 4th Movement in Beijing.

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,240
He has rich experience.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,720
We should make full use of this opportunity,

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
learn as much as possible.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,200
Tell everyone.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
The board meeting will be held at eight o'clock tomorrow.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,320
Yes

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,520
What's wrong?

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,000
I can't stand it anymore.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
I have to go to Beijing.

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm bringing my little girl back at all cost. 

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,800
Calm down.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,680
Darling.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,400
The situation in Beijing is stable now.

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,520
I believe 

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
she's safe in Beijing.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
Besides, our factory just went back to operate normally.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,400
It's a busy time.

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,640
I thought they said

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,480
that they will come back to Shanghai soon.

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
Don't worry, when they get back to Shanghai

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,600
I will figure out something to stop her from going to France.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,200
Wait, you won't let them go to France?

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,680
No.

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
So you're not interested in marrying our daughter into Chen's?

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,600
Not to that family,

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,760
with the dad going in and out jail.

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
You were the one wanted that marriage.

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,320
You said Chen Yannian has a bright future.

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
He will be doing great work for the country.

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
Thing's different now.

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,600
Throughout this May 4th Movement

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
I realized a lot.

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
This country

58
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,880
is based on small-scale production and small-scale peasant economy.

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
Once there is a large-scale movement from the bottom,

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,240
it can be a disaster

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
for people like us with assets and resources.

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm worring about our daughter.

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,600
Why are you telling me these?

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
I have to.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,440
Have you forgotten there's a time

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,600
you couldn't sleep tight at all.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
You mean during the three strikes.

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,320
Ah, at that time

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,800
school and factory went on strike,

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,240
business closed.

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
We had it all here in Shanghai.

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
General stike.

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
That month

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,960
I did some calculations.

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,840
We lost tens of thousands.

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
Wan't that strike for opposing the Paris Peace Treaty?

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
For patriotism and national salvation?

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,480
You're not being patriotic now.

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
Of course I'm patriotic. 

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,000
I am and

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,760
I am more patriotic than those students.

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
I believe in saving the nation through education,

83
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,920
saving the country depends on industrial entity.

84
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,920
Anyway, I have no plan

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
in becoming family with the Chen's.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,120
I can't take the risk.

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,240
Say whatever you want, you are a businessman.

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,920
When it comes to profits and ideal,

89
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,520
it's always ideal for you.

90
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,440
What is ideal?

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,960
In my opinion, ideal is like a lamp.

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,160
It lights up your heart.

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
But if you really follow that light,

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,080
you'll only fall and get injured.

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,920
Moreover, there is no end.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Whether this light

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,200
will lead me to life or death,

98
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,320
I have no idea.

99
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,520
Have some tea.

100
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,440
Fellow colleagues.

101
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,520
First of all, I'd like say I'm sorry.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
Because of my arrest

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
New Youth has been on a pause for four months.

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,640
Our readers

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
and supportors

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,920
have been calling for restart of our paper.

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
They all have high expectation

108
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,480
So today, we'll discuss about it.

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,280
After what happened,

110
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
you must all have some special feelings.

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,600
I hope you can share it with the others here.

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120
Then I'll speak first. 

113
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
I think the biggest drawback

114
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
of our paper

115
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,760
is the rotating peer edit chief system.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,040
This system has caused 

117
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
every editor only focuses on what he wants.

118
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,520
In a way,

119
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
it stops our paper opearting as a whole,

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,000
adds unpredictability to it.

121
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,120
Shizhi

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Whatever you say needs to be supported by evidence.

123
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,200
Please give us an example.

124
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
Example is lying around openly for everyone to see.

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,120
We are here for an open discussion.

126
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,480
This discussion is not aiming at one specific person.

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,200
Please, Mr. Bannong, don't take it personaly.

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,960
I have no intention of accusing you.

129
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
What do you mean? Please speak out.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
If you insist,

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
I'll speak my mind honestly then.

132
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
For example, Shouchang was the editor on duty. 

133
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,280
He decided to put out an issue 

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,960
focusing on Marx's research.

135
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
It received a lot of extreme comments

136
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,920
and extreme feedback.

137
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,280
It caused a lot of trouble.

138
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,720
I think such a issue

139
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
is not aligning with our belief

140
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,200
in running this journal.

141
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,080
Shizhi

142
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,440
During this period,

143
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
you have been busy guesting Professor Dewey.

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
There are many things you don't know. 

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
Shouchang didn't make that decision all by himself.

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,480
That issue on research of Marxism,

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,520
I knew about it.

148
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,760
Deqian and Yucai also knew.

149
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,040
Yes.

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,960
The feedback and comments I have received, 

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,960
were mostly positive and of high recommendation

152
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,640
from all walks of life.

153
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,960
They said that this issue has brought a new trend

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,720
for the research of ideology in China.

155
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
That issue sold very well too.

156
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
Many Japanese friends also wrote letters,

157
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
saying they would like to take a look.

158
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,600
Yes, yes, that issue

159
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,040
was printed twice.

160
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
There is not even one copy in stock now.

161
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
It's not about how many copies been printed.

162
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
When I took over the Weekly Review

163
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,240
the circulation is also high.

164
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
It still got banned at last.

165
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,840
Then you should learn from your mistakes.

166
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,560
Indeed.

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,040
I learned the lesson.

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,200
And I think this rotating editor in chief system

169
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,040
is not necessary

170
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,480
for the <New Youth>.

171
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,160
If you trust me,

172
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
I will take the job as editor in chief.

173
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,840
I will make sure that our <New Youth>

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
become the first-class academic journal in China.

175
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,160
Shizhi,

176
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,680
you are still holding on your old mindset.

177
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Let me share my opinion.

178
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
I agree that we should abolish the rotating system,

179
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,960
no more people taking turns being the editor in chief.

180
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
But I don't agree with Shizhi taking the job.

181
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,360
Why?

182
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,400
<New youth>

183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,640
It was brought to life by Zhongfu himself.

184
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,720
Now that Zhongfu has been released.

185
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,040
I think it should still be returned to Zhongfu.

186
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
He can do the job.

187
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,720
Zhongfu, you got this.

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
We support you as always.

189
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,160
I suggest,

190
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,240
whoever supports this proposal please clap your hands.

191
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,320
From Volume 7, No.1 issue, 

192
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
<New Youth> will have Chen Duxiu as the editor in chief.

193
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,280
good

194
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,960
good

195
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Zhongfu tends to go to extreme.

196
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Why did you propose

197
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,600
that he should do the job?

198
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
Shizhi can be too cautious sometimes,

199
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
but he is also careful.

200
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
Things can't go too wrong if he is in charge.

201
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,080
So you mean

202
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Shizhi should be editing <New Youth>

203
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,240
by himself

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
I think he is more suitable than Zhongfu.

205
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,040
Wrong.

206
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,800
These two people

207
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
Let me give you an analogy.

208
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
IF you see their strategy as a warehouse,

209
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,640
Mr Duxiu will set up a large banner in front of the door,

210
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
with words written clearly on it.

211
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,440
"Weaponed up, take care."

212
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,800
But the door will be left open.

213
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
You can know what is inside with one look, can be few knives or others.

214
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,000
Open and clear, no need to worry.

215
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,680
But when it comes to Mr. Shizhi.

216
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
The warehouse will be closed,

217
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
with a small note on the door.

218
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,800
Also with words written on it,

219
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,560
"Nothing harmful inside, please don't be afraid."

220
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
Of course this note could be telling the truth.

221
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
But some people, at least people like me

222
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
I will always stop and think

223
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,280
before I reach out and push that door.

224
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
So you mean

225
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,520
Zhongfu is more reliable, isn't it?

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Think for yourself.

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,720
Obituary

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
Professor of Chinese Literature in Peking University

229
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240

230
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,920
Mr. Liu Shipei, Comptroller of National History Compilation Office

231
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
Passed away of illness.

232
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,200
At the age of 36.

233
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,760
In memory of Professor Liu Shipei

234
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
and his outstanding achievements in many fields

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
classic studies, historiography and literature.

236
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
A funeral ceremony for Professor Liu Shipei

237
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
will be held today in MiaoGuang Hall.

238
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,080
Hosted by Mr. Chen Duxiu.

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,480
Set up by students from the Chinese literature department.

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Peking University colleagues are invited to attend. 

241
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,520
This obituary

242
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
I'll have a student later

243
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
puting it onto the bulletin board.

244
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,520
Zhongfu, thank you for agree to host.

245
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
Me and Shenshu,

246
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,840
we always have different political views,

247
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,400
different academic views.

248
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
But

249
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,720
we do respect and value each other.

250
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,960
It is also my wish to see him off.

251
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
It's such a shame

252
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,160
Only thirty-six years old.

253
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
What about the manuscripts of his works now?

254
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
I organized a few people

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
we will check up and finish his manuscripts.

256
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
And give all those to Peking University Library for preservation.

257
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
That will be my last work

258
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
as the head of the compilation department

259
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,560
at this job you assigned me to.

260
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,320
Master Cai, I want to...

261
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,040
Zhongfu

262
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,840
The thing is

263
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,680
now that we lost Shenshu,

264
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
the National History Compilation Office

265
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
has lost it's core.

266
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
What's might happen is that

267
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,760
Xu Shuzheng,

268
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,760
he wants it take it over,

269
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
changes it back to the National History Museum,

270
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
and have it under the management of the State Council.

271
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
If he successes,

272
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
Zhongfu,

273
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,280
then the history discipline department of Peking University

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
will never be what it used to be.

275
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,200
Xu Shuzheng is a warlord.

276
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
I can not let him lay his dirty hands on academics.

277
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
Zhongfu, you know that.

278
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
In 1917

279
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
When I first came to Peking University as the president.

280
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
It caused me much troubles to take it back 

281
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,920
from Fan Yuanlian.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
I reorganized the place,

283
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,880
I personally served as the director.

284
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,320
All these is to

285
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,680
establish the most authoritative discipline of Chinese history

286
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
in Peking Univeristy.

287
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
My goal and my ideal is to write a book.

288
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
A book of the correct and thorough history of China.

289
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,200
Master Cai

290
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,680
I understand.

291
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
If this can be done,

292
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,960
it will benefit the country and the people tremendously.

293
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,200
It's just that I am now 

294
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,040
now...

295
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
Listen, listen to me. 

296
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,040
Last night.

297
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,400
I had a good look at Shenshu's

298
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
outline of the National History Compilation Office.

299
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,680
I read it all.

300
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,560
I was so excited that I didn't sleep well all night.

301
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,720
The part of political history,

302
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
and the part of customs of civilization history,

303
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
these two parts are mostly completed.

304
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,440
Thirty-six volumes of political history

305
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
Twenty-seven volumes of civilization history

306
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,880
It's done in high quality.

307
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,840
He left a lot of valuable first drafts too.

308
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,120
Zhongfu, Shenshu has left. 

309
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,320
This job,

310
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,000
no, this project.

311
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
It's probably gonna just be left aside.

312
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
I have talked about it to you several times.

313
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
I also have asked you to take his place in the Compiling Office.

314
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
Because I believe only you have this ability.

315
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,280
Because if you don't come

316
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,520
then this project can never be completed.

317
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,560
Master Cai

318
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
I thank you for your trust in me.

319
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,640
No, no, no

320
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,280
Zhongfu, you and I are brothers.

321
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
We don't need to use the word thank.

322
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
All I want from you now

323
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
is a clear answer.

324
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,680
Master Cai, I have thought about it.

325
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,280
Think about it. Think about it.

326
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,560
What I just told you

327
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,440
please think about it a lot.

328
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,000
Master Cai

329
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
Sooner or later, I will leave.

330
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,520
At this point,

331
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
various schools appeared here in Peking University.

332
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,560
That reform plan we made together at the beginning,

333
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,640
most of it has came true.

334
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
It's time for me to go.

335
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
I am speaking from the bottom of my hear.

336
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
I knew.

337
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,240
I knew your answer before you stated talking.

338
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,840
I knew Peking University is too small a stage for you.

339
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,120
You are a free-spirited person aims big.

340
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
You deserve to shine on a bigger stage.

341
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
I remember

342
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,960
how it was snowing heavily that year.

343
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
The year I welcomed you to Peking University.

344
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Now it's autumn, winter is right at the corner.

345
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
But I have to see you off this time.

346
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,000
Hard.

347
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:42,960
Nevertheless.

348
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,320
Zhongfu, I know that you will always be a part of Peking University.

349
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,920
Please believe that wherever you go,

350
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,720
Peking University and Cai Yuanpei

351
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,360
will always have your back.

352
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,520
Yannian

353
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,800
One second.

354
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,480
Go to your uncle Shouchang first.

355
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,080
I'm gonna walk around a bit.

356
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,960
Yes

357
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,440
come on

358
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,680
You guys gather together here.

359
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,080
Where are you going?

360
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,440
Where can we go?

361
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,840
You leaving Peking University.

362
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,320
We came to see you off. 

363
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,680
Where is Shizhi?

364
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,120
Five ministers going abroad.

365
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,040
Shizhi is busying see them off.

366
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
What do you mean by five ministers going abroad?

367
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,280
Shizhi usde that sponsered fund from Mu Ouchu,

368
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
sent Luo Jialun, Duan Xipeng and other three people

369
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,960
to study in the United States.

370
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,680
People here in Uni joked that five ministers went abroad.

371
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,960
There are many students studying abroad recently.

372
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
That's right.

373
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
Fu Sinian did not make it into the five ministers. 

374
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,920
Shizhi managed to find a way,

375
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
got him a quota in Shandong.

376
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,360
Now Fu has left to the States too.

377
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
Xu Deheng and the others

378
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
went to France to work and study.

379
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
The pioneers of the May Fourth Movement have all left.

380
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,760
It feels like curtains has came off afterall.

381
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,000
I hope they will all take the right path.

382
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm going to England, too

383
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,880
I knew.

384
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,720
Bannong, I wrote you this.

385
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
I wanted to bring it to you specially.

386
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
Since we are all here to say goodbye

387
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
I will give it to you now.

388
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,920
You are one with strong ambition,

389
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,080
driven by that you walk all over this country's land.

390
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,160
You found this place and decided to stay.

391
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
But it's only a temporary stop afterall.

392
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
I see what this long journey has done to you.

393
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
Your body suffered but your mind gained.

394
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
One day we will realize our dream

395
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
and get to live in peace ever after.

396
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
I feel reluctant to part with you here.

397
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,840
And to leave our <New Youth>.

398
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,760
The New Youth is always there.

399
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
From now on, you will be an oversea peer editor

400
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,560
for <New Youth>.

401
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,080
We are still on the same side.

402
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,440
I hope that

403
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
You can also write for New Youth.

404
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,600
Especially your poetry.

405
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,960
Now it can be said that no one can match it

406
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
You are flattering me.

407
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,440
I will try my best.

408
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,800
Zhongfu

409
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,480
Brother Jigang 

410
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,280
Zhongfu

411
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
Givng up on the promising job working as a professor.

412
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
You just have to leave and attend to that journal of yours.

413
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,360
A journal might goes nowhere.

414
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,640
Without you,

415
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
China is missing a great book of general history.

416
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,160
What a loss this is!

417
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Have you ever thought about this?

418
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,360
Brother Ji Gang, you have your academics.

419
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
I have my journal.

420
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
As for whether it is a loss.

421
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,360
Time will prove it.

422
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
hopeless

423
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
Goodbye, brother Zhongfu.

424
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,240
Zhongfu

425
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,760
Will you still fight even when you go somewhere far away?

426
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,720
If there's still a breath, there's still fighting.

427
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,040
Brother, take care. Take care

428
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
Brothers, take care.

429
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,920
[Liu Bannong, pioneer of the New Culture Movement, literary scholar, linguist, and educator. Died in Beijing in 1934, at age 43.]

430
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:58,629
[Huang Kan, famous linguist and philologist. Died in Nanjing in 1935, at age 49.]

431
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:18,825
[Gu Hongming, famous translator. Died in Beijing in 1928, at age 71.]

432
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,880
Shouchang

433
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,800
This is my official farewell to Peking University.

434
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
From now on, 

435
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
I will concentrate on New Youth

436
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
and social activities.

437
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,880
All these years passed,

438
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
you ended up being a professional revolutionary again. 

439
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,920
I admire you!

440
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,480
Shouchang, <NeW Youth> is back again.

441
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
I think after all that happened,

442
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
It should have a new look.

443
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
I want to write another manifesto.

444
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,040
Show it to the world

445
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,520
I think we should listen to 

446
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,800
what young people have to say.

447
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
They are the future.

448
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,640
That's right.

449
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,320
How about this?

450
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
You know Yannian and Qiaonian are going to France.

451
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
I keep telling them

452
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,200
that I would take them to the Great Wall.

453
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,800
But I didn't have time.

454
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,920
It's late autumn now.

455
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,160
Autumn wind seizes the north.

456
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
Leaves turning red.

457
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
We should take the young ones, go to the Great Wall.

458
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,400
How's that sound to you?

459
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,920
Witnessing history and nowadays at the Great Wall,

460
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,680
along with the beautiful scenery.

461
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,040
Perfect time and perfect location

462
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Ma Jun and Zhou Enlai  

463
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,360
started a club in Tianjin.

464
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,880
They invited me to give a speech tomorrow.

465
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
So how about this weekend?

466
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,960
Good.

467
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,600
Boys and girls

468
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,280
Yannian, Qiaonian

469
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,040
When I first arrived in Beijing. 

470
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,160
I told them that

471
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
be sure to visit the Great Wall.

472
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,280
Standing at the Great Wall,

473
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,440
it will broaden your horizon than ever.

474
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,640
They are going to say goodbye today.

475
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,080
Leaving home and heading for a long trip.

476
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,320
This tour here

477
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,400
is the perfect farewell for us.

478
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,920
This is where you see and remember your hometown,

479
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
where you crave this scene in your mind.

480
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,560
Ah, Great Wall

481
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,920
Great Wall

482
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,960
was a barrier built for against foreign enemies 

483
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,160
by our ancestor. 

484
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,080
But have you ever thought about it?

485
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,840
In Qing Dynasty or in this Republic of China,

486
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,360
with all those people holding great ambitions,

487
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
all those people who sacrificed one's life to save the country.

488
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,240
Why this country 

489
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
with walls of thousands miles

490
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200
is broken like this.

491
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,960
We kept losing and being bullied,

492
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,960
in this world where the robbers can always have their way.

493
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,680
What is the method to strengthen this country?

494
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,040
Mr. Zhongfu, we all think

495
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,960
we should stand out

496
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
and destroy the old world. 

497
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,680
Good point!

498
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
It is time

499
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
to get rid of Miliarism and Capitalism from this world.

500
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
Our ideal new society

501
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
It is honest, progressive and positive.

502
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
Free, equal and creative.

503
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,520
Beautiful, kind and peaceful.

504
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,960
People mutually love and help each other.

505
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,320
People proud of labor and enjoy working.

506
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
The whole society is delightful.

507
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
I hope all those false,

508
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,040
conservative and negative,

509
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
bound by the tradition of the class.

510
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,040
Ugly, evil, war-like

511
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
Lazy, sentimental and bored.

512
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,160
Where only a few get to live happily

513
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,240
will gradually vanish and be destroyed.

514
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
We shall be friendly with

515
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,480
people from all the race, all the ethnicity in the world.

516
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,840
But for aggression

517
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,400
and possessive individualism,

518
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
we will treat them as enemy.

519
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,040
What our ideal includes movement by the people,

520
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
social transformation.

521
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,360
We must cut tie with

522
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,360
any past and present political parties. 

523
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
We believe in true democracy,

524
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,600
we want to allocate political power to the people. 

525
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
Wealth will no longer be seen as a criterion to decide if one is good or bad.

526
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
We oppose all political parties which support interests of only a few, 

527
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,320
or of a specific class,

528
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,880
or when it does not consider about the common happines for the people.

529
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,800
Students, since the Opium War

530
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
we Chinese people has been on a long journey looking for a solution.

531
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
It's been eighty years.

532
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,640
We have tried whatever we can.

533
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,240
But today

534
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,560
on this ancient Great Wall,

535
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,840
me and Mr. Zhongfu

536
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,160
found hope.

537
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,360
Students.

538
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,840
You are the pioneers of this era. 

539
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I hope that with the strength of youth 

540
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,760
you will realize the great ideal of socialism.

541
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,560
You will rebuild the great glory of our nation.

542
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
Enough from us two.

543
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
Go and feel the Great Wall.

544
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,080
Yes.

545
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Sky is boundless just like our ambition.

546
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,920
This sencery before us is endless just like our life.

547
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,760
Sun shines upon the ground,

548
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
birds departure to somewhere far away.

549
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,560
We are all strangers on foreign land,

550
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,960
all our dreamsa and all our thoughts, no matter where we go and who we meet,

551
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,240
no one probably will understand.

552
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,640
come on

553
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,040
See who climbs up first.

554
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,080
Shouchang

555
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,440
Do you know

556
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,200
I spent more than three months in prison.

557
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,560
During the time, I focused on reading books and materials

558
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
on the theory of socialism

559
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
and the October Revolution in Russia.

560
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,720
I can say that now

561
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,560
I have a deep understanding

562
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
of Marxism.

563
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,800
Tell me about it.

564
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,000
Wait a minute.

565
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,160
I-I need to talk to you. 

566
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
What is it?

567
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,560
I'm going to France soon.

568
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,760
Do you want to marry me?

569
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,920
Comrade Yi.

570
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,480
Didn't we both agree?

571
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,840
We are comrades.

572
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,520
We can't be that kind of relationship.

573
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,400
Besides, you are going to France soon.

574
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,080
We don't even know if we can meet or not,

575
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,320
or when we can meet.

576
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,920
I will ask you one last time.

577
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
Yes or no?

578
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,760
Qunxian

579
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,880
Comrade Qunxian

580
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,080
I swear on the Great Wall.

581
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,360
I can't marry you

582
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,920
Dont be like this please.

583
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,440
I'm gonna cry on this Great Wall.

584
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,040
When the Great Wall collapses over my tears,

585
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,160
you will be buried underneath it.

586
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,480
Although now

587
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm not quite sure yet

588
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,600
But generally speaking

589
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,440
I have a preliminary concept in my mind.

590
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,960
That is

591
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
maybe only Marxism,

592
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,640
can save China.

593
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,000
Maybe there is only the road of Russian October Revolution

594
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,520
that can save China.

595
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,760
I can deeply relate to you now.

596
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,080
Feels like we are witnessing light shining upon this country.

597
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
I want to cheer for you

598
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,240
for you eventually come to realize it.

599
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,200
I really want to shout loudly at the Great Wall.

600
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,480
There is hope for China afterall.

601
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,640
That's also why I said

602
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
for the re-issue of New Youth,

603
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,560
We should focus on publicizing and introducing Marxism. 

604
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,080
We should publicize and study the Russian October Revolution. 

605
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,160
The goal of our New Youth will be transfered

606
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,240
from enlightment 

607
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,480
to looking for the road to save the nation,

608
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
to realize the fundamental transformation of society.

609
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,040
Here.

610
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,520
I've made a formal application.

611
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
Next semester,

612
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,040
I want to start a class of historical materialism

613
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,280
and a class of the international workers' movement.

614
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,400
At the same time, I also want to establish a Marxist theory research society.

615
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,840
I want to be ready so that one day in the future 

616
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,960
we can establish a political organization.

617
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,120
Good.

618
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,040
You are thinking in long term here.

619
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,520
After the May 4th Movement

620
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,680
there is some questions

621
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,040
that we need to reconsider about.

622
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,160
The key is

623
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,800
we want to rebuild a country,

624
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,640
we want to create this new country

625
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
where all people

626
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,080
can live a happy life.

627
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,440
Good point!

628
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,200
This is also the gist of the reissue declaration

629
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,680
for New Youth.

630
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,800
Shouchang, I'm really happy today

631
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,280
The youth should pursue this course,

632
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,120
be rational and endeavour,

633
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,920
go forward and not look back,

634
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,640
shun the dark and face the light,

635
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
to advance civilization for the world,

636
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,080
to create happiness for all mankind,

637
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,240
with a youthful self,

638
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,880
create a youthful family,

639
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
a youthful country,

640
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,640
a youthful nation,

641
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,400
a youthful mankind,

642
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,320
a youthful Earth,

643
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,000
a youthful universe,

644
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,760
to enjoy one's endless life.

645
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,080
Riding the wind and breaking the waves, is indeed a long way away.

646
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,560
What is to worry

647
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,240
even if we can not keep spring here forever?

648
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,000
Yannian

649
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,200
Qiaonian

650
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,000
You are going to work and study in France.

651
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,920
You have been waiting for five years. 

652
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,240
Good things worth waiting.

653
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,720
Before you go,

654
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,040
I still have a few words to tell you.

655
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,000
You know what I am like,

656
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,760
I have to say what's on my mind.

657
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,600
As far as I know

658
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,320
European war ended and now there is an economic depression.

659
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
France has a high unemployment rate at the moment. 

660
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,400
More importantly,

661
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,720
their current national government is nothing but a showcase. 

662
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,320
They dont have sufficient financial resources

663
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,640
and live by borrowing money from foreign countries.

664
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,320
At time like this, such a government-funded Sino-French university

665
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,840
is it reliable?

666
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,760
So

667
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,600
You need to prepare for in case there is no uni to go to.

668
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,560
But Mr. Wu Zhihui...

669
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,080
Will you hear me out?

670
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,960
To be honest, for this work-study program 

671
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
I am not fully supportive.

672
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,600
Thousands of people go there all at once,

673
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,760
they can't speak the language well,

674
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,160
and there is not enough money.

675
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,920
It's impossible that everyone of them can go study in the school

676
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
If that happens,

677
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,160
it will cause a big social problem.

678
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,000
We are mentally prepared for difficulties.

679
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,160
Don't worry about that.

680
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,040
I worry

681
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,400
I'm worried about more than that.

682
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,240
I worry about your faith too.

683
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,760
You don't have to worry about this either.

684
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,760
Me and Qiaonian

685
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,600
We are both people of faith.

686
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,080
I know, especially you, Yannian

687
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
I know you have already done deep study and research

688
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,640
on anarchism.

689
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
You even organized an evolution club in Shanghai 

690
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,080
with Huang Lingshuang and others.

691
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,320
You were the editor-in-chief of Evolution Monthly and Series,

692
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,440
you were even wanted by the government and the patrol house.

693
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,800
I understand that

694
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,040
our motive is to save the country.

695
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,000
But,

696
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,360
you are too obsessed with anarchism.

697
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,360
That's what I'm worried about.

698
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,360
Our choice of faith has been through

699
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
a long period of comparison and verification.

700
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,160
I have also undergone long-term comparison and verification.

701
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,560
Yannian

702
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,280
I also tried to 

703
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,000
use the theory and principle of mutual aid theory

704
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,840
To save China.

705
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
But will it work?

706
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,960
Have you ever thought about it?

707
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,680
The work-study mutual aid society you started at first.

708
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
What is the real reason for its failure?

709
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,120
I thought... I now think that

710
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
that the true reason

711
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,040
is that it won't work trying to fix this country

712
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,160
little by little.

713
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,760
If China wants to strengthen itself

714
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,240
it must go through

715
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,560
a continuous, large-scale revolution.

716
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,120
Isn't it too early for you to draw this conclusion?

717
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,840
Not at all.

718
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,800
We have been wandering around cluelessly for a long time.

719
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,320
We are now at this point

720
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,320
When we have to make up our mind.

721
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Yannian Qiaonian

722
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,400
I just hope you won't be stubborn

723
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,480
and blind yourself with only one theory.

724
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
If only you can take sometime

725
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
to read about Marx's works,

726
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,760
to study the present situation of Soviet Russia.

727
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,280
Don't deny it before you learn about it.

728
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,120
Okay?

729
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,040
We accept your suggestion.

730
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,600
good

731
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,040
good

732
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,160
As a father

733
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,040
I should have cared for you.

734
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,000
I should have made sure that you grow up healthily and live safely.

735
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
But as a father

736
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,840
how much I wish

737
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,240
that the three of us

738
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,760
will one day

739
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,040
fighting in the same trench.

740
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
We will be able to work together

741
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
for this country in trouble.

742
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,080
This is also what we hope.

743
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,320
Good

744
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,280
Pack your things.

745
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,720
Last week, Chen Duxiu moved out his stuff

746
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
left in Peking University.

747
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,840
He wen to the Great Wall 

748
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,040
with Li Dazhao in the weekends.

749
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,520
Yesterday, he gave a lecture in a normal school.

750
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,000
This is the content of the report. 

751
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,480
People like Chen Duxiu

752
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
you have to keep an eye on them,

753
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,560
but how to do it is not that simple.

754
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,360
you can't let him out of your sight

755
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,960
but you can't have him notice too.

756
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,120
Especially now,

757
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,240
it's North-South Peace Period

758
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,800
we can't have anything goes wrong because of him.

759
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
However,

760
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
as long as nothing big happens,

761
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,960
you can also relax a bit.

762
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,400
You all worked hard.

763
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,400
Remember, as long as nothing big happens.

764
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,760
Understood

765
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,640
Go now.

766
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,440
I will excuse myself.

767
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

768
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,040
Look at the new issue of New Youth 

769
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,200
New declaration for the paper!

770
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
New political ideas!

771
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,600
New social ideals!

772
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,880
Read newspaper!

773
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,320
Newspaper!

774
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,480
Look at the newly published New Youth

775
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,240
New declaration for the paper!

776
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,520
Please have one, sir.

777
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,920
Newspaper!

778
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,240
Look at the newly published New Youth!

779
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,200
Please.

780
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,360
Mr. Cai

781
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,000
Mr. Zhongfu is here.

782
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,080
Mr. Zhongfu.

783
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,560
Master Cai

784
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,440
come on

785
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:39,920
You wanted to see me.

786
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,800
Please sit down.

787
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:41,680
Brother Zhongfu.

788
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,320
Shizhi

789
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,760
Come, come, sit here.

790
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,880
Okay.

791
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,160
Zhang Shizhao sent a telegram.

792
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,920
I wanted to send it to you.

793
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,720
But I was talking business with Shizhi, couldn't find the time.

794
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,320
So I invited you here.

795
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,240
Take a look.

796
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,080
Xingyan sent this from Guangdong.

797
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,160
He is now the general secretary in the southern government.

798
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
He's also the representative of this North-South peace talks.

799
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,680
He said that

800
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,680
the Southern government has approved

801
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,960
Chen Jiongming's plan,

802
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,160
they will start to work on establishing Southwest University.

803
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,920
Zhang Shizhao and some others

804
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,720
along with us two are entrusted as the one responsible for

805
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,640
the establishment plan for the Southwest University.

806
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,320
Zhang Shizhao said

807
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,240
he wants you to

808
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,400
go to Shanghai to meet him,

809
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,000
then go to Guangzhou.
