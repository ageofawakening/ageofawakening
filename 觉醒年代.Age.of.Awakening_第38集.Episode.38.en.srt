This country

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,880
is based on small-scale production and small-scale peasant economy.

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
Once there is a large-scale movement from the bottom,

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,240

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
I agree that we should abolish the rotating system,

188
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,960
no more people taking turns being the editor-in-chief.

189
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
But I don't agree with Shizhi taking the job.

190
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,360
Why?

191
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,400
"New Youth"

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,640
was brought to life by Zhongfu himself.

193
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,720
Now that Zhongfu has been released,

194
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,040
I think it should still be returned to Zhongfu.

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
He can do the job.

196
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,720
Zhongfu, you got this.

197
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
We support you as always.

198
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,160
I suggest,

199
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,240
whoever supports this proposal please clap your hands.

200
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,320
From Volume 7, Issue 1,

201
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
"New Youth" will have Chen Duxiu as the editor-in-chief.

202
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,280
Good.

203
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,960
Good!

204
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Zhongfu tends to go to extremes.

205
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Why did you propose

206
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,600
that he should do the job?

207
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
Shizhi can be too cautious sometimes,

208
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
but he is also careful.

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
Things can't go too wrong if he is in charge.

210
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,080
So you mean

211
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Shizhi should be editing "New Youth"

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,240
by himself?

213
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
I think he is more suitable than Zhongfu.

214
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,040
Wrong.

215
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,800
These two people,

216
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
let me give you an analogy.

217
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
If you see their strategy as a warehouse,

218
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,640
Mr. Duxiu will set up a large banner in front of the door,

219
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
with words written clearly on it:

220
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,440
"Weaponed up, take care",

221
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,800
but the door will be left open.

222
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
You can know what is inside with one look, can be few knives or others.

223
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,000
Open and clear, no need to worry.

224
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,680
But when it comes to Mr. Shizhi,

225
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
the warehouse will be closed

226
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
with a small note on the door.

227
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,800
Also with words written on it:

228
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,560
"Nothing harmful inside, please don't be afraid".

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
Of course this note could be telling the truth.

230
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
But some people, at least people like me,

231
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
I will always stop and think

232
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,280
before I reach out and push that door.

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
So you mean

234
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,520
Zhongfu is more reliable, isn't it?

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Think for yourself.

236
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,720
Obituary.

237
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
Professor of Chinese Literature in Peking University,

238
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
Instructor of the Faculty of Liberal Arts,

239
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,920
Mr. Liu Shipei, Comptroller of National History Compilation Office,

240
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
passed away of illness,

241
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,463
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

242
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,200
at the age of 36.

243
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,760
In memory of Professor Liu Shipei

244
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
and his outstanding achievements in the many fields of

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
classic studies, historiography and literature,

246
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
a funeral ceremony for Professor Liu Shipei

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
will be held today in Miaoguang Hall

248
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,080
hosted by Mr. Chen Duxiu.

249
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,480
Many students of the Chinese literature department,

250
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
are invited to attend.

251
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,520
This obituary,

252
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
I'll have a student later

253
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
posting this onto the bulletin board.

254
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,520
Zhongfu, thank you for agreeing to host.

255
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
I and Shenshu

256
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,840
always had different political views,

257
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,400
different academic views.

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
But

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,720
we did respect and value each other.

260
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,960
It is also my wish to see him off.

261
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
It's such a shame.

262
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,160
Only thirty-six years old.

263
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
What about the manuscripts of his works now?

264
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
I organized a few people

265
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
to check up and finish his manuscripts

266
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
and give all those to Peking University Library for preservation.

267
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
That will be my last work

268
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
as the head of the compilation department

269
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,560
at this job you assigned me to.

270
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,320
Master Cai, I want to...

271
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,040
Zhongfu.

272
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,840
The thing is

273
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,680
now that we lost Shenshu,

274
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
the National History Compilation Office

275
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
has lost its core.

276
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
What's might happen is that

277
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,760
Xu Shuzheng

278
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,760
wants it take it over,

279
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
change it back to the National History Museum,

280
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
and have it under the management of the State Council.

281
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
If he successes,

282
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
Zhongfu,

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,280
then the history department of Peking University

284
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
will never be what it used to be.

285
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,200
Xu Shuzheng is a warlord.

286
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
I can not let him lay his dirty hands on academics.

287
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
Zhongfu, you know that.

288
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
In 1917,

289
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
when I first came to Peking University as the president,

290
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
it caused me much troubles to take it back

291
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,920
from Fan Yuanlian.

292
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
I reorganized the place,

293
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,880
I personally served as the director.

294
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,320
All these to

295
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,680
establish the most authoritative discipline of Chinese history

296
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
in Peking Univeristy.

297
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
My goal and my ideal is to write a book.

298
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
A book of the correct and thorough history of China.

299
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,200
Master Cai.

300
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,680
I understand.

301
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
If this can be done,

302
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,960
it will benefit the country and the people tremendously.

303
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,200
It's just that I am now

304
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,040
I...

305
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,001
Listen, listen to me.

306
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:14,880
Listen to me.

307
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,040
Last night,

308
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,400
I had a good look at Shenshu's

309
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
outline of the National History Compilation Office.

310
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,680
I read it all.

311
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,560
I was so excited that I didn't sleep well all night.

312
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,720
The part of political history,

313
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
and the part of customs of civilizational history,

314
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
these two parts are mostly completed.

315
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,440
Thirty-six volumes of political history.

316
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
Twenty-seven volumes of civilizational history.

317
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,880
All of them of high quality.

318
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,840
He left a lot of valuable first drafts too.

319
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,120
Zhongfu, Shenshu has left.

320
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,320
This job,

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,000
no, this project.

322
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
It's probably gonna just be left aside.

323
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
I have talked about it to you several times.

324
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
I also have asked you to take his place in the Compilation Office.

325
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
Because I believe only you have this ability.

326
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,280
Because if you don't come

327
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,520
then this project can never be completed.

328
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,560
Master Cai.

329
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
I thank you for your trust in me.

330
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,640
No, no, no.

331
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,280
Zhongfu, you and I are brothers.

332
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
We don't need to use the word thank.

333
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
All I want from you now

334
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
is a clear answer.

335
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,680
Master Cai, I have thought about it.

336
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,280
Think about it. Think about it.

337
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,560
What I just told you,

338
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,440
please think about it a lot.

339
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,000
Master Cai.

340
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
Sooner or later, I will leave.

341
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,520
At this point,

342
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
various schools appeared here in Peking University.

343
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,560
That reform plan we made together at the beginning,

344
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,640
most of it has came true.

345
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
It's time for me to go.

346
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
I am speaking from the bottom of my heart.

347
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
I knew.

348
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,240
I knew your answer before you stated talking.

349
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,840
I knew Peking University is too small a stage for you.

350
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,120
You are a free-spirited person who aims big.

351
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
You deserve to shine on a bigger stage.

352
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
I remember

353
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,960
how it was snowing heavily that year.

354
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
The year I welcomed you to Peking University.

355
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Now it's autumn, winter is right at the corner.

356
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
But I have to see you off this time.

357
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,000
It's hard.

358
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:42,960
Nevertheless.

359
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,320
Zhongfu, I know that you will always be a part of Peking University.

360
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,920
Please believe that wherever you go,

361
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,720
Peking University and Cai Yuanpei

362
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,360
will always have your back.

363
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,520
Yannian.

364
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,800
One second.

365
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,480
Go to your uncle Shouchang first.

366
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,080
I'm gonna walk around a bit.

367
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:46,418
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

368
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,960
Yes.

369
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,440
Let's go.

370
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,680
You guys gather together here.

371
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,080
Where are you going?

372
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,440
Where can we go?

373
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,840
You leaving Peking University.

374
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,595
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Professor at Peking University]

375
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,320
We came to see you off.

376
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,680
Where is Shizhi?

377
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,120
Five ministers are going abroad.

378
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,040
Shizhi is busy seeing them off.

379
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
What do you mean by five ministers going abroad?

380
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,280
Shizhi used that sponsored fund from Mu Ouchu,

381
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
and sent Luo Jialun, Duan Xipeng and other three people

382
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,960
to study in the United States.

383
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,680
People here in Peking University joke that five ministers went abroad.

384
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,960
There are many students studying abroad recently.

385
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
That's right.

386
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
Fu Sinian did not make it into the five ministers.

387
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,920
Shizhi managed to find a way,

388
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
got him a quota in Shandong.

389
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,360
Now Fu has left to the United States too.

390
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:03,891
[Gao Yihan, Professor at Peking University]

391
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
Xu Deheng and the others

392
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
went to France for work-study.

393
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
The pioneers of the May Fourth Movement have all left.

394
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,760
It feels like the curtains has come off after all.

395
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,000
I hope they will all take the right path.

396
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm going to England, too.

397
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,880
I knew.

398
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,720
Bannong, I wrote you this.

399
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
I wanted to bring it to you specially.

400
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
Since we are all here to say goodbye,

401
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
I will give it to you now.

402
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,920
You are one with strong ambition,

403
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,080
driven by that you walk all over this country's land.

404
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,160
You found this place and decided to stay.

405
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
But it's only a temporary stop after all.

406
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
I see what this long journey has done to you.

407
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
Your body suffered but your mind gained.

408
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
One day we will realize our dream

409
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
and get to live in peace ever after.

410
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
I feel reluctant to part with you here

411
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,840
and to leave our "New Youth".

412
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,760
"New Youth" will always be there.

413
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
From now on, you will be an oversea peer editor

414
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,560
for "New Youth".

415
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,080
We are still on the same side.

416
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,440
I hope that

417
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
you can still write for "New Youth"

418
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,600
especially with your poetry.

419
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,960
Now it can be said that no one can match it.

420
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
You flatter me.

421
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,440
I will try my best.

Zhongfu.

425
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
You give up the promising job of working as a professor.

426
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
You just have to leave and attend to that journal of yours.

427
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,360
A journal that might go nowhere.

428
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,640
Without you,

429
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
China is missing a great book of general history.

430
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,160
What a loss this is!

431
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Have you ever thought about this?

432
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,360
Brother Jigang, you have your academics.

433
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
I have my journal.

434
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
As for whether it is a loss.

435
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,360
Time will prove it.

436
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
Hopeless.

Will you still fight even when you go somewhere far away?

440
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,720
If there's still a breath, there's still fighting.

441
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,040
Brother, take care. Take care.

442
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320

This is my official farewell to Peking University.

448
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
From now on,

449
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
I will concentrate on "New Youth"

450
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
and social activities.

451
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,880
All these years passed,

452
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
you ended up being a professional revolutionary again.

453
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,920
I admire you!

454
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,480
Shouchang, "New Youth" is back again.

455
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
I think after all that happened,

456
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
It should have a new look.

457
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
I want to write another manifesto

458
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,040
and show it to the world.

459
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,520
I think we should listen to

460
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,800
what young people have to say.

461
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
They are the future.

462
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,640
That's right.

463
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,320
How about this?

464
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
You know Yannian and Qiaonian are going to France.

465
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
I keep telling them

466
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,200
that I would take them to the Great Wall.

467
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,800
But I didn't have time.

468
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,920
It's late autumn now.

469
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,160
Autumn wind seizes the north.

470

Leaves turning red.

471
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
We should take the young ones, go to the Great Wall.

They invited me to give a speech tomorrow.

479
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
So how about this weekend?

480
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,960

is the perfect farewell for us.

493
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,920
This is where you see and remember your hometown,

494
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
and crave this scene in your mind.

495
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,560
The Great Wall.

496

The Great Wall,

by our ancestors.

499
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,080
But have you ever thought about it?

500
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,840
In Qing Dynasty or in this Republic of China,

501
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,360
with all those people holding great ambitions,

502
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
all those people who sacrificed one's life to save the country.

503
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,240
Why this country

504
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
with walls of thousands miles

505
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200
is broken like this.

506
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,960
We keep losing and keep being bullied,

507
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,960
in this world where the robbers can always have their way.

508
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,680
What is the method to strengthen this country?

509
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,040
Mr. Zhongfu, we all think

510
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,960
we should stand out

511
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
and destroy the old world.

512
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,680
Good point!

513
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
It is time to get rid

514
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
of militarism and capitalism from this world.

515
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
Our ideal new society

516
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
is honest, progressive, positive,

517
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
free, equal, creative,

518
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,520
beautiful, kind, peaceful,

519
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,960
where people mutually love and help each other,

520
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,320
where people pride their labor and enjoy working,

521
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
where the whole of society is happy,

522
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
hoping all those false,

523
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,040

524
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,040
ugly, evil, war-like,

526
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
lazy, sentimental, and boring,

527

where only a few get to live happily,

528
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,240
will gradually vanish and be destroyed.

529
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
We shall be friendly with

530
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,480
people from all races, from all ethnicities in the world.

531
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,840
But for aggression

532
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,400
and possessive individualism,

533
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
we will treat them as enemy.

534
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,040
Our ideal is a movement of the people,

535
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
a social transformation.

536
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,360
We must cut ties with

537
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,360
any past and present political parties.

538
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
We believe in true democracy,

539
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,600
we want to allocate political power to the people.

540
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
Wealth will no longer be seen as a criterion to decide if one is good or bad.

541
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
We oppose all political parties which support interests of only a few,

542
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,320
or of a specific class,

543
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,880
or when it does not consider about the common happines for the people.

544
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,800
Students, since the Opium War,

545
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
we Chinese people have been on a long journey looking for a solution.

546
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
It's been eighty years.

547
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,640
We have tried whatever we can.

548
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,240
But today,

549
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,560
on this ancient Great Wall,

You are the pioneers of this era.

554
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I hope that with the strength of youth

555
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,760
you will realize the great ideal of socialism.

556
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,560
You will rebuild the great glory of our nation.

557
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
Enough from us two.

558
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
Go and enjoy the Great Wall.

559
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,080
Yes.

560
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
The sky is boundless just like our ambition.

561
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,920
This scenery before us is endless just like our life.

562
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,760
The sun shines upon the ground,

563
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
birds us departure to somewhere far away.

564
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,560
We are all strangers on foreign land,

565
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,960
with all our dreams and thoughts, no matter where we go and who we meet,

566
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,240
no one will truly understand.

567
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,640
Let's go.

568
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,040
See who climbs up first.

569
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,080
Shouchang.

570
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,440
Did you know,

571
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,200
I spent more than three months in prison.

572
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,560
During the time, I focused on reading books and materials

573
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
on the theory of socialism

574
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
and the October Revolution in Russia.

575
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,720
I can say that now

576
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,560
I have a deep understanding

577
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
of Marxism.

578
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,800
Tell me about it.

579
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,000
Wait a minute.

580
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,160
I-I need to talk to you.

581
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
What is it?

582
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,560
I'm going to France soon.

583
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,760
Do you want to marry me?

584
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,920
Comrade Yi.

585
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,480
Didn't we both agree?

586
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,840
We are comrades.

587
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,520
We can't be that kind of relationship.

588
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,400
Besides, you are going to France soon.

589
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,080
We don't even know if we can meet or not,

590
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,320
or when we can meet.

591
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,920
I will ask you one last time.

592
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
Yes or no?

593
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,760
Qunxian.

594
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,880
Comrade Qunxian.

595
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,080
I swear on the Great Wall,

596
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,360
I can't marry you.

597
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,920
Dont be like this please.

598
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,440
I'm gonna cry on this Great Wall.

599
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,040
When the Great Wall collapses over my tears,

600
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,160
you will be buried underneath it.

601
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,480
Although now,

602
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm not quite sure yet.

603
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,600
But generally speaking,

604
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,440
I have a preliminary concept in my mind.

605
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,960
That is,

606
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
maybe only Marxism

607
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,640
can save China.

608
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,000
Maybe there is only the road of Russian October Revolution

609
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,520
that can save China.

610
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,760
I can deeply relate to you now.

611
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,080
Feels like we are witnessing light shining upon this country.

612
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
I want to cheer for you

613
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,240
for you eventually come to realize it.

614
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,200
I really want to shout loudly at the Great Wall.

615
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,480
There is hope for China after all.

616
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,640
That's also why I said

617
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
for the re-issue of "New Youth",

618
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,560
we should focus on publicizing and introducing Marxism,

619
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,080
we should publicize and study the Russian October Revolution.

620
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,160
The goal of our "New Youth" will be transferred

621
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,240
from enlightment

622
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,480
to looking for the road to save the nation,

623
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
to realize the fundamental transformation of society.

624
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,040
Look at it.

625
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,520
I've made a formal application.

626
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
Next semester,

627
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,040
I want to start a class of historical materialism

628
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,280
and a class of the international workers' movement.

629
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,400
At the same time, I also want to establish a Marxist theory research society.

630
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,840
I want to be ready so that one day in the future

631
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,960
we can establish a political organization.

632
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,120
Good. Shouchang.

633
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,040
You are thinking in long term here.

634
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,520
After the May Fourth Movement

635
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,680
there is some questions

636
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,040
that we need to reconsider about.

637
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,160
The key is

638
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,800
we want to rebuild a country,

639
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,640
we want to create this new country

640
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
where all the people

641
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,080
can live a happy life.

642
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,440
Good point!

643
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,200
This is also the gist of the reissue declaration

644
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,680
for "New Youth".

645
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,800
Shouchang, I'm really happy today.

646
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,280
The youth should pursue this course,

647
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,120
be rational and endeavour,

648
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,920
go forward and not look back,

649
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,640
shun the dark and face the light,

650
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
to advance civilization for the world,

651
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,080
to create happiness for all mankind,

652
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,240
with a youthful self,

653
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,880
create a youthful family,

654
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
a youthful country,

655
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,640
a youthful nation,

656
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,400
a youthful mankind,

657
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,320
a youthful Earth,

658
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,000
a youthful universe,

659
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,760
to enjoy one's endless life.

660
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,080
Our ambitions and aspirations, lie distant and far.

661
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,560
For what is to worry

662
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,240
of not forever keeping the spring?

663
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,000
Yannian.

664
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,200
Qiaonian.

665
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,000
You are going to work and study in France.

666
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,920
You have been waiting for five years.

667
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,240
Good things are worth waiting.

668
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,720
Before you go,

669
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,040
I still have a few words to tell you.

670
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,000
You know what I am like,

671
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,760
I have to say what's on my mind.

672
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,600
As far as I know,

673
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,320
the war in has ended and now there is an economic depression.

674
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
France has a high unemployment rate at the moment.

675
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,400
More importantly,

676
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,720
their current national government is nothing but a showcase.

677
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,320
They don't have sufficient financial resources

678
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,640
and live by borrowing money from foreign countries.

679
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,320
At time like this, is such a government-funded Sino-French university

680
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,840
reliable?

681
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,760
So,

682
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,600
you need to prepare for in case there is no university to go to.

683
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,560
But Mr. Wu Zhihui...

684
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,080
Will you hear me out?

685
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,960
To be honest, for this work-study program,

686
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
I am not fully supportive.

687
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,600
Thousands of people go there all at once,

688
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,760
they can't speak the language well,

689
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,160
and there is not enough money.

690
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,920
It's impossible that everyone of them can go study in the school.

691
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
If that happens,

692
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,160
it will cause a big social problem.

693
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,000
We are mentally prepared for difficulties.

694
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,160
Don't worry about that.

695
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,040
I worry.

696
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,400
I'm worried about more than that.

697
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,240
I worry about your faith too.

698
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,760
You don't have to worry about this either.

699
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,760
I and Qiaonian

700
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,600
are both people of faith.

701
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,080
I know, especially you, Yannian.

702
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
I know you have already done deep study and research

703
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,640
on anarchism.

704
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
You even organized an evolution club in Shanghai

705
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,080
with Huang Lingshuang and others.

706
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,320
You were the editor-in-chief of "Evolution Monthly and Series",

707
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,440
you were even wanted by the government and the patrol house.

708
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,800
I understand that

709
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,040
our motive is to save the country.

710
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,000
But,

711
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,360
you are too obsessed with anarchism.

712
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,360
That's what I'm worried about.

713
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,360
Our choice of faith has been through

714
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
a long period of comparison and verification.

715
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,160
I have also undergone long-term comparison and verification.

716
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,560
Yannian

717
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,280
I also tried to

718
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,000
use the theory and principle of mutual aid theory

719
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,840
to save China.

720
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
But will it work?

721
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,960
Have you ever thought about it?

722
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,680
The work-study mutual aid society you started at first.

723
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
What is the real reason for its failure?

724
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,120
I thought... I now think that

725
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
that the true reason

726
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,040
is that it won't work trying to fix this country

727
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,160
little by little.

728
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,760
If China wants to strengthen itself

729
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,240
it must go through

730
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,560
a continuous, large-scale revolution.

731
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,120
Isn't it too early for you to draw this conclusion?

732
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,840
Not at all.

733
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,800
We have been wandering around cluelessly for a long time.

734
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,320
We are now at this point,

735
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,320
when we have to make up our mind.

736
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Yannian. Qiaonian.

737
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,400
I just hope you won't be stubborn

738
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,480
and blind yourself with only one theory.

739
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
If only you can take sometime

740
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
to read about Marx's works,

741
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,760
to study the present situation of Soviet Russia.

742
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,280
Don't deny it before you learn about it.

743
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,120
Okay?

744
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,040
We accept your suggestion.

745
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,600
Okay.

746
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,040
Okay.

747
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,160
As a father,

748
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,040
I should have cared for you.

749
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,000
I should have made sure that you grow up healthily and live safely.

750
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
But as a father,

751
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,840
how much I wish

752
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,240
that the three of us

753
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,760
will one day

754
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,040
fight in the same trench.

755
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
We will be able to work together

756
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
for this country in trouble.

757
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,080
This is also what we hope.

758
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,320
Good.

759
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,280
Pack your things.

760
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,720
Last week, Chen Duxiu moved out his stuff

761
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
left in Peking University.

762
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,840
He went to the Great Wall

763
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,040
with Li Dazhao in the weekends.

764
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,520
Yesterday, he gave a lecture in a normal university.

765
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,000
This is the content of the report.

766
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,480
People like Chen Duxiu,

767
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
you have to keep an eye on them,

768
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,560
but how to do it is not that simple.

769
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,360
you can't let him out of your sight

770
00:39:27,193 --> 00:39:29,327
[Wu Bingxiang, Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department]

771
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,960
but you can't have him notice too.

772
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,120
Especially now,

773
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,240
it's the North-South Peace Period.

774
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,800
We can't have anything goes wrong because of him.

775
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
However,

776
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
as long as nothing big happens,

777
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,960
you can also relax a bit.

778
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,400
You all worked hard.

779
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,400
Remember, as long as nothing big happens.

780
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,760
Understood.

781
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,640
Go now.

782
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,440
I will excuse myself.

783
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640

Mr. Cai

797
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,000
Mr. Zhongfu is here.

798
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,080
Mr. Zhongfu.

799
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,560
Master Cai.

800
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,440
Come.

801
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:39,920
You wanted to see me.

802
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,800
Please sit down.

803
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:41,680
Brother Zhongfu.

804
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,320
Shizhi.

805
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,760
Come, come, sit here.

806
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,880
Okay.

807
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,160
Zhang Shizhao sent a telegram.

808
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,920
I wanted to send it to you.

809
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,720
But I was talking business with Shizhi, couldn't find the time.

810
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,320
So I invited you here.

811
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,240
Take a look.

812
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,080
Xingyan sent this from Guangdong.

813
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,160
He is now the general secretary in the southern government.

814
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
He's also the representative of this North-South peace talks.

815
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,680
He said that

816
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,680
the Southern government has approved

817
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,960
Chen Jiongming's plan,

818
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,160
they will start to work on establishing Southwest University.

819
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,920
Zhang Shizhao and some others

820
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,720

821
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,640

822
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,320
Zhang Shizhao said

823
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,240
