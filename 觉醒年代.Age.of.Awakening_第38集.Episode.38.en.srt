[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,071
[Episode Thirty-eight]

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,320
Because of the need of struggle

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
The names of the members of our Awakening Society

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,360
Not open to the public

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,040
And draw lots.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
Named after the number 

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,240
Used as a code for communication.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,440
And the pseudonym of the published article.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,880
There are fifty notes on the table now.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,880
A number is written on each note.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,480
The number you drew.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
Is your future correspondence code and pen name.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,720
Let's start catching turtles now.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,360
I'm the thirty-sixth

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
Then I will be called Shanlu from now on.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm number one. My name is Yihao.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,120
I'm number five

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,200


20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,240
Comrades

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
The first activity of our enlightenment society.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
Is to invite Professor Li Dazhao from Peking University.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
Come to our club to give lectures and give guidance.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,560
Professor Li is the instructor of the May 4th Movement in Beijing.

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,240
Have rich experience in struggle.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,720
We should make full use of this opportunity.

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
Ask him humbly.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,200
Go down.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
The board meeting will be held at eight o'clock tomorrow.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,320
be

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,520
Madame

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,000
I really can't stand it.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
I have to go to Beijing.

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
Whatever I say, I will bring the little darling back. 

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,800
Don't worry yet.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,680
Madame

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,400
The situation in Beijing is basically stable now.

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,520
I believe our daughter.

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
It is safe in Beijing.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
Our other factory has just resumed work.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,400
It's a busy time.

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,640
I thought they didn't say

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,480
Will you go back to Shanghai soon?

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
Don't worry, when they get back to Shanghai

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,600
I tried to keep my daughter from going to France.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,200
What, you won't let them go to France?

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,680
be

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
So you're not going to climb the Chen family door?

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,600
People who go to jail

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,760
Who dares to climb?

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
Don't you have to be with them?

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,320
Said Chen Yannian had a bright future.

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
Must be the beam of the country.

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
It's been a while.

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,600
Madam passed the May 4th Movement.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
I really realized a lot of new things.

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
Like our country.

58
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,880
Based on small-scale production and small-scale peasant economy

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
Once there is a big mass movement

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,240
People like us who have status and assets

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
That's a disaster.

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm telling you about my daughter

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,600
Why are you telling me these things?

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
I must tell you these things.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,440
Have you forgotten when you

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,600
You can't sleep at night.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
I mean, during the three strikes.

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,320
Ah, at that time

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,800
Strikes in factories and schools 

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,240
Shangpu guanmen

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
This is not the third strike. We have it.

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
Have you got everything?

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
That's more than a month

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,960
I made an account.

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,840
We lost tens of thousands of oceans.

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
That's not for refusing to sign the Paris Peace Treaty.

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
For patriotism and national salvation?

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,480
You're not patriotic again 

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
Of course I'm patriotic. 

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,000
I think

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,760
I am more patriotic than those students.

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
I believe in saving the nation through education. 

83
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,920
Industry saves the country.

84
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,920
Anyway, Chen Duxiu's in-laws

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
I dare not climb Liu Wenyao.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,120
I can't afford it either.

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,240
After all, you are a businessman.

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,920
When it comes to interests

89
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,520
I can't think about it.

90
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,440
Madam, what is your ideal?

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,960
In my opinion, ideal is like a lamp.

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,160
You look at it with a bright heart. 

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
But if you really follow it

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,080
You'll get your head broken.

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,920
The most important thing is that you can't see the head. 

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Take this road.

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,200
Dead end or alive?

98
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,320
I have no bottom in my heart.

99
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,520
Pour your own water.

100
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,440
Fellow colleagues

101
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,520
First of all, I'd like to express my feelings to you.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
Because of my arrest

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
New Youth has been closed for four months.

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,640
Subscriber

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
And all sectors of society.

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,920
There is a high demand for the resumption of publication.

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
The expectation value is also very high.

108
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,480
So today, we'll discuss the resumption of publication.

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,280
Must have gone through this ordeal.

110
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
You all have some special feelings in your hearts.

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,600
I hope you can tell me everything you know.

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120
Then I'll speak first. 

113
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
I think our "New Youth" 

114
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
The biggest drawback is that

115
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,760
Peer rotation editing system

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,040
This system has caused 

117
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
Every editor does his own thing.

118
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,520
Destroyed us.

119
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
The Integrity of New Youth

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,000
Added randomness.

121
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,120
Shizhi

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
You should have a basis for what you say.

123
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,200
Please give an example of your point of view.

124
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
Examples abound, a handful of them. 

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,120
We are here to discuss things.

126
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,480
It must be right, not right.

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,200
Please, Mr. Bannong, don't take your seat by yourself. 

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,960
I have no intention of accusing you.

129
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
What do you mean? Please speak out.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Now that you're here. 

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
Then I'll do it honestly.

132
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
For example, Shouchang was the editor on duty. 

133
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,280
I edited an issue by myself.

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,960
A special issue on Marx's research

135
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
Received a lot of extreme comments.

136
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,920
Extreme articles

137
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,280
It caused a lot of trouble.

138
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,720
I think such a special issue

139
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
With our New Youth

140
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,200
The purpose of running a journal is contrary. 

141
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,080
Shizhi

142
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,440
during this period

143
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
You have been busy receiving Professor Dewey.

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
There are many things you don't know. 

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
Shouchang is not self-editor.

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,480
This issue of his special issue on Marx studies

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,520
I agree.

148
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,760
De and Yucai also know.

149
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,040
exactly

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,960
I got the news.

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,960
People from all walks of life made up this issue for Shouchang. 

152
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,640
Actually, the evaluation is very high.

153
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,960
It's for China's ideological circle.

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,720
There is a breeze blowing.

155
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Besides, I have an impression that this issue is particularly good.

156
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
Many Japanese friends also wrote letters. 

157
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
Said he wanted to see this issue. 

158
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,600
Yes, yes, this issue

159
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,040
It was printed twice.

160
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
There is not even one copy in stock now.

161
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
How much is printed doesn't tell the story.

162
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
When I took over the Weekly Review

163
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,240
The circulation is also high.

164
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
It was finally banned.

165
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,840
Then you should review your mistakes.

166
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,560
right

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,040
I was inspired by the lesson.

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,200
I think our New Youth

169
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,040
There's no need to do this again.

170
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,480
Peer rotation editing system

171
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,160
If people trust me.

172
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
Just leave it to me to make it up.

173
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,840
I must put our "New Youth" 

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
Make it a first-class academic journal in China.

175
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,160
Shizhi, ah

176
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,680
You are still a cliche.

177
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Let me say my opinion.

178
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
I agree with New Youth. 

179
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,960
Abolish the system of peer editors taking turns on duty. 

180
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
But I don't agree that Shizhi should make it up alone. 

181
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,360
Why?

182
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,400
New youth

183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,640
Zhongfu brought it alone.

184
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,720
Zhongfu has been released from prison now.

185
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,040
I think it should still be returned to Zhongfu.

186
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
Let him make it up alone.

187
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,720
Zhongfu, you can do your part.

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
We support you as always.

189
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,160
I suggest that.

190
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,240
Everyone adopted the following resolution by acclamation.

191
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,320
New Youth, Volume 7, No.1 

192
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
Still edited by Chen Duxiu.

193
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,280
good

194
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,960
good

195
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Zhongfu is so extreme.

196
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,240
How do you propose?

197
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,600
Let him compile New Youth by himself?

198
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
Shizhi is too cautious.

199
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
But he is careful.

200
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
As for the big paper leakage.

201
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,080
What do you mean?

202
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Let Shizhi be alone

203
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,240
Go to compile "New Youth" 

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
I think he is more suitable than Zhongfu.

205
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,040
serious mistake

206
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,800
These two people

207
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
Let me give you an analogy.

208
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
If you compare military strategy to a warehouse

209
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,640
Mr Duxiu will erect a banner in front of the door.

210
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
Big eight words in a book

211
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,440
Be careful if you are armed inside.

212
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,800
But the door is open.

213
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
There are several guns and knives in it.

214
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,000
Be clear at a glance and don't be wary. 

215
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,680
But what about Mr. Shizhi 

216
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
The warehouse is closed.

217
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
There will be a little note on the door.

218
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,800
Also post eight words. 

219
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,560
Don't worry if there is no weapon inside.

220
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
Naturally, this can be true.

221
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
But some people, at least people like me

222
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
Before I push the door 

223
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,280
I always think about it sideways.

224
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
your meaning

225
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,520
Zhongfu is reliable, isn't it?

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Think for yourself.

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,720
obituary

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
Professor of Chinese Literature in Peking University

229
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
Instructor of liberal arts institute

230
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,920
Mr. Liu Shipei, Comptroller of National History Compilation Office

231
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
Died of illness.

232
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,200
At the age of 36.

233
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,760
In memory of Professor Liu Shipei

234
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
Studying classics, historiography and literature

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
Outstanding achievements in many fields

236
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
This is to be held at Miaoguang Pavilion today. 

237
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
Hold Professor Liu Shipei's offering ceremony.

238
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,080
Hosted by Mr. Chen Duxiu

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,480
Many students from the Chinese literature department cook together.

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Peking University colleagues are invited to attend. 

241
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,520
This obituary

242
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
I'll find a classmate soon. 

243
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
Put it on the bulletin board.

244
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,520
Zhongfu would like to thank you for hosting.

245
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
Me and Uncle Shen 

246
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,840
Different political views all one's life

247
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,400
Academic views are also different

248
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
but

249
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,720
We do have some pity for each other.

250
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,960
It is also my wish to give him a ride.

251
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
Uncle Shen, it's too bad.

252
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,160
Thirty-six years old

253
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
What about the manuscripts of his works now?

254
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
I organized a few people. 

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
Check up Uncle Shen's remains.

256
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
Prepare to be sent to Peking University Library for preservation.

257
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
That's what I do. 

258
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
You appointed this for me.

259
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,560
The last job of the director of the compilation department.

260
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,320
Master Cai, I want to

261
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,040
Zhongfu

262
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,840
That's right.

263
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,680
Uncle Shen left.

264
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,880
National History Compilation Office

265
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,440
National History Compilation Office

266
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
It fell down a pillar.

267
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
What's happening now?

268
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,760
Xu Shu is a man.

269
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,760
He took it back.

270
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
It is still called the National History Museum.

271
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
Under the leadership of the State Council

272
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
If he's going to make it

273
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
中富啊

274
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,280
The history discipline of Peking University

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
That's more than half a day down.

276
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,200
Xu Shuzheng is a warlord.

277
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
I can't let him spoil my knowledge.

278
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
Zhongfu, you know that.

279
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
In 1917

280
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
When I first came to Peking University as president

281
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
I took it hard from Fan Yuanlian.

282
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,920
Give it back.

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
I reorganize.

284
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,880
I personally serve as the director.

285
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,320
purpose

286
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,680
Is to let Peking University set up a door.

287
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
The most authoritative discipline of Chinese history

288
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
My ideal is to write a book.

289
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
The real general history of China

290
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,200
Master Cai

291
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,680
I see what you mean.

292
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
I think if this thing is done 

293
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,960
It is indeed a meritorious deed.

294
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,200
It's just that I am now 

295
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,040
I guess

296
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
Listen, listen to me. 

297
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,040
This last night

298
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,400
I reported Uncle Shen before.

299
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
Outline of the National History Compilation Office

300
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,680
I watched it again.

301
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,560
I was so excited that I didn't sleep well all night.

302
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,720
His ambition to compile political history.

303
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
And the customs of civilization history.

304
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
These two parts are basically completed.

305
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,440
Thirty-six volumes of political history

306
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
Twenty-seven volumes of civilization history

307
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,880
It's done quite well.

308
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,840
And left a lot of valuable first drafts.

309
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,120
Zhongfu Shenshu left like this.

310
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,320
You know this job?

311
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,000
It should be called engineering.

312
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
That's probably going to run aground

313
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
How many times have I told you?

314
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
I also ask you to take his place in the Compiling Office.

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
Because I believe only you have this ability.

316
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,280
Because if you don't come

317
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,520
Then this job is basically a miscarriage.

318
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,560
Master Cai

319
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
I thank you for your trust in me.

320
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,640
No, no, no

321
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,280
Zhongfu, you and I are brothers.

322
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
Why should we talk about thanks?

323
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
I want to listen to you now.

324
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
Just give an accurate answer.

325
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,680
Master Cai, I think twice.

326
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,280
Think about it. Think about it.

327
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,560
What I just told you

328
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,440
Think about it a lot.

329
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,000
Master Cai

330
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm leaving.

331
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,520
the moment

332
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
Peking University has formed various schools.

333
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,560
I worked out the reform plan with you at the beginning. 

334
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,640
It has also been realized.

335
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
I should leave Peking University.

336
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
Speak from my heart.

337
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
I know.

338
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,240
You will have this kind of answer.

339
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,840
I confess that the stage of Peking University is too small.

340
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,120
You are a free-spirited person.

341
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
It should be developed in a bigger place.

342
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
At this moment, I think 

343
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,960
It snowed heavily that year.

344
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
I welcome my husband to Peking University.

345
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
It's like autumn today.

346
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
But I'm sending my husband away.

347
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,000
Feel bad.

348
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:42,960
of course

349
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,320
Zhongfu, I firmly believe that you are from Peking University.

350
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,920
Please believe that wherever you go.

351
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,720
Peking University and my Cai Yuanpei

352
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,360
It's all your Zhongfu's backing.

353
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:30,960
011111117

354
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,280
1111

355
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,520
Yannian

356
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,800
wait a jiffy

357
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,480
Go to your uncle Shouchang first.

358
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,080
I walk by myself.

359
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,960
line

360
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,440
come on

361
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,680
You guys gather together.

362
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,080
Where are we going?

363
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,440
Where can we go?

364
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,840
You leave Peking University.

365
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,320
We came to see you off. 

366
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,680
史鸷呢

367
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,120
Five ministers go abroad

368
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,040
Shizhi set out to see off.

369
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
What do you mean by five ministers going abroad?

370
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,280
Shizhi sponsored by Mu Ouchu

371
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
Luo Jialun Duan Xipeng and other five people. 

372
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,960
To study in the United States.

373
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,680
Peking University people joked that five ministers went abroad.

374
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,960
There are many students studying abroad recently.

375
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
That's right.

376
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
Fu Sinian did not squeeze into the five ministers. 

377
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,920
Shizhi will find a way.

378
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
He was given a place in Shandong.

379
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,360
Now people have gone to America, too 

380
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
There are Xu De and others.

381
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
Go to France to work and study.

382
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
The pioneers of the May Fourth Movement have all left.

383
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,760
It makes people feel a little bleak in autumn wind.

384
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,000
I hope they can all take the right path.

385
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm going to England, too

386
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,880
I see

387
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,720
Bannong, I wrote you a picture.

388
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
I wanted to send it to you specially.

389
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
Since I'm here to say goodbye

390
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
Then I'll give you the floor now

391
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,920
Ben has a high ambition

392
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,080
Piaohu haijian

393
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,160
Occasional rest of the city

394
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
Youjue chasing after climbing

395
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
Cold shadow backs people thin.

396
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
Return the lonely to the lonely.

397
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
Dao Feng Wang Zi Jin

398
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
Zaowan Sanshan

399
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
A little reluctant to part with you here.

400
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,840
Reluctant to our "New Youth" 

401
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,760
The New Youth is still there.

402
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
Now you are from New Youth. 

403
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,560
Overseas peer editor

404
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,080
We are still in a trench.

405
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,440
hope

406
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
You can also write articles for New Youth.

407
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,600
Especially your poetry.

408
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,960
Now it can be said that no one can match it

409
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Brother Zhongfu won the prize.

410
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,440
I will try my best.

411
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,800
Zhongfu

412
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,480
Jigang brother

413
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,280
中富啊

414
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
You said you wouldn't do it with a good professor.

415
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
You have to make that up. 

416
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,360
Neither fish nor fowl magazine

417
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,640
As soon as you run

418
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
China is missing a general history.

419
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,160
What a loss this is!

420
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Have you ever thought about this question?

421
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,360
Brother Ji Gang, do your learning.

422
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
Make me neither fish nor fowl.

423
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
As for whether it is a loss.

424
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,360
History has its own public opinion

425
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
hopeless

426
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
Goodbye, brother Zhongfu.

427
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,240
Zhongfu

428
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,760
Do you still fight when you go?

429
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,720
There's still a breath, and there's still fighting.

430
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,040
Xiandi, take care. Take care

431
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
Brother Tang takes care.

432
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,920
[Liu Bannong, pioneer of the New Culture Movement, literary scholar, linguist, and educator. Died in Beijing in 1934, at age 43.]

433
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:58,629
[Huang Kan, famous linguist and philologist. Died in Nanjing in 1935, at age 49.]

434
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:18,825
[Gu Hongming, famous translator. Died in Beijing in 1928, at age 71.]

435
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,880
Shouchang

436
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,800
This is my official farewell to Peking University.

437
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
from now on 

438
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
I will concentrate on editing New Youth.

439
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
And engage in social activities.

440
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,880
walk back and forth

441
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
Now you are a professional revolutionary again. 

442
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,920
Admire you!

443
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,480
Shouchang's New Youth will be published again.

444
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
I think I've been through so much tempering.

445
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
It should be a new look.

446
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
I want to write another manifesto.

447
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,040
Show it to the world

448
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,520
I think we should listen to it

449
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,800
The opinions of those young people

450
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
They are the future.

451
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,640
That's right.

452
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,320
Do you think this will work?

453
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
It just so happens that Yannian Qiaonian is also going to France.

454
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
I keep telling them

455
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,200
Take them to the Great Wall. 

456
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,800
I can't find time.

457
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,920
It's late autumn.

458
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,160
Autumn wind seizes the north.

459
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
Frost and dye drunk

460
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
We made an appointment with young people.

461
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,400
How about visiting the Great Wall together?

462
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,920
The city is infinite and ancient. 

463
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,680
Qianjian Fangliguan Mountain

464
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,040
Good situation

465
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Ma Jun in Tianjin and Zhou Enlai. 

466
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,360
Set up an awareness club.

467
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,880
Let me tell them about it tomorrow.

468
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
How about our weekend?

469
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,960
good

470
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,600
Boys and girls

471
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,280
YannianQiaonian

472
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,160
When I first arrived in Beijing. 

473
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,240


474
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,040
When I first arrived in Beijing

475
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,160
I'll tell them both.

476
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
Be sure to visit the Great Wall.

477
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,280
The Great Wall

478
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,440


479
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,640
They are going to say goodbye today.

480
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,080
Went on a long trip to the country. 

481
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,320
Let's take a tour here.

482
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,400
Can be described as strong.

483
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,920
Where can I see our northern territory?

484
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
See the Drum Tower with full eyes.

485
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,560
Ah, Great Wall

486
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,920
Great Wall

487
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,960
Was once our ancestor.

488
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,160
A barrier against foreign enemies of dreams.

489
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,080
But have you ever thought about it?

490
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,840
Whether it was the Qing Dynasty or the people's pressure 

491
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,360
How many people with lofty ideals?

492
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
Sacrifice one's life to save the country.

493
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,240
Why is our country

494
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
There are thousands of miles of empty ruins.

495
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200
But it's still full of sores.

496
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,960
In this world of robbers

497
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,960
Lose again and again and be bullied by others.

498
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,680
Where is the road to a rich country in Qiang Bing?

499
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,040
Mr. Zhongfu, we all think

500
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,960
We should stand up bravely.

501
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
Destroy the old world. 

502
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,680
Good point!

503
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
Militarism and jinlism in the world

504
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
It should be abandoned now.

505
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
Our ideal new society

506
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
It is honest, progressive and positive.

507
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
Free, equal and created.

508
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,520
Beautiful and peaceful

509
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,960
Mutual-loving

510
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,320
Labor-happy

511
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
The whole society is happy.

512
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
I hope that the false

513
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,040
Conservative and negative

514
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
Bound by the tradition of the class

515
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,040
Ugly, evil, war-like

516
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
Lazy, sentimental and bored.

517
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,160
A few happy phenomena

518
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,240
Gradually reduce and destroy

519
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
We are interested in all the nationalities in the world. 

520
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,480
All should show friendly feelings.

521
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,840
But for aggression

522
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,560
And possessive warlords and chaebols.

523
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,400
And possessive warlords and wealth.

524
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
We have to treat each other with hostility.

525
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,040
Our idea is a popular movement.

526
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
It is social transformation.

527
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,360
And past and present political parties.

528
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,360
Absolutely sever ties

529
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
We believe in real democracy.

530
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,600
Will allocate political power to the people. 

531
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
Don't take wealth as a criterion.

532
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
We oppose all support for the selfish interests of the minority. 

533
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,320
Or a class interest.

534
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,880
A political party without the happiness of the whole society. 

535
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,800
Students, since the Opium War

536
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
In order to find a prescription for saving the nation, we Chinese people

537
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
It's been eighty years.

538
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,640
It can be said that I have tasted all kinds of prescriptions.

539
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,240
But today

540
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,560
On this ancient Great Wall

541
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,840
I'm with Mr. Zhongfu on you.

542
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,160
Saw this dawn.

543
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,360
classmates

544
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,840
You are the pioneers of this era. 

545
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I hope that with the strength of youth 

546
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,760
To realize the great ideal of socialism.

547
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,560
To rebuild the great glory of our nation.

548
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
Don't listen to the two of us speaking here.

549
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
You each feel the Great Wall.

550
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,080
good

551
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Chu Tian gan Li Qing Qiu

552
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,920
Water goes with the sky and autumn is boundless.

553
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,760
The west's sun slants toward the building

554
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
In the plaintive sound of lone wild geese flying away in the sky

555
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,560
And my homesick wanderer in the south

556
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,960
Wu Gou looked at the railing and patted it all over.

557
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,240
No one will attend.

558
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,640
come on

559
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,040
See who climbs up first.

560
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,080
Shouchang

561
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,440
Do you know

562
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,200
I spent more than three months in prison.

563
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,560
I focused on the socialist theory.

564
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
And the October Revolution in Russia

565
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
Some books and materials

566
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,720
I can tell you exactly now.

567
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,560
For Marxist theory

568
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
I have a further understanding.

569
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,800
say something

570
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,000
Wait a minute.

571
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,160
I-I need to talk to you. 

572
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
What words?

573
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,560
I'm going to France soon.

574
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,760
You marry me.

575
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,920
Not Comrade Yi.

576
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,480
Didn't we both agree?

577
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,840
We are comrades.

578
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,520
It can't be that kind of relationship.

579
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,400
Besides, you are going to France soon.

580
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,080
Can we meet in the future? 

581
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,320
It's impossible to say when we can meet.

582
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,920
Let me ask you one last time.

583
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
Marry or not?

584
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,760
Qunxian

585
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,880
Comrade Qunxian

586
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,080
I swear on the Great Wall.

587
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,360
I can't marry you

588
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,920
You don't do that 

589
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,440
I'm going to cry at the Great Wall.

590
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,040
Cry down the Great Wall

591
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,160
Beat you to death

592
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,480
Although now

593
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm not quite sure yet

594
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,600
But generally speaking

595
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,440
Have a preliminary concept.

596
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,960
That is

597
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Maybe only Marxism.

598
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,640
Can save China

599
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,000
Maybe there is only the road of Russian October Revolution.

600
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,520
To save China.

601
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,760
Brother Zhongfu's intention to board the board is unknown.

602
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,080
Wei Xia man Tian

603
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
I really want to sublimate this idea for you.

604
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,240
Cheer loudly

605
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,200
I really want to shout at the Great Wall.

606
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,480
China is saved.

607
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,640
So I said

608
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
Re-issue of New Youth

609
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,560
We should focus on publicizing and introducing Marxism. 

610
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,080
To publicize and study the Russian October Revolution. 

611
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,160
We should put the emphasis on profit management

612
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,240
Enlightened by the original thought

613
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,480
Turn to the road of saving the nation.

614
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
Realize the fundamental transformation of society.

615
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,040
Look this way.

616
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,520
I've made a formal application.

617
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
Next semester

618
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,040
I want to set up historical materialism

619
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,280
And the international workers' movement.

620
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,400
At the same time, I also want to establish a Marxist theory research society.

621
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,840
Provide a political organization for the future. 

622
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,960
get ready

623
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,120
好寿昌

624
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,040
Or do you think long term?

625
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,520
After the May 4th Movement

626
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,680
We do have some questions.

627
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,040
I need to think deeper.

628
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,160
The key is

629
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,800
We want to rebuild a country.

630
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,640
Re-create a country with a new salary

631
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
And let the people.

632
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,080
Live in a happy life

633
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,440
Good point!

634
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,200
This is also our New Youth. 

635
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,680
The gist of the reissue declaration

636
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,800
Shouchang, I'm really happy today

637
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,280
The youth should pursue this course,

638
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,120
be rational and endeavour,

639
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,920
go forward and not look back,

640
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,640
shun the dark and face the light,

641
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
to advance civilization for the world,

642
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,080
to create happiness for all mankind,

643
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,240
with a youthful self,

644
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,880
create a youthful family,

645
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
a youthful country,

646
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,640
a youthful nation,

647
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,400
a youthful mankind,

648
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,320
a youthful Earth,

649
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,000
a youthful universe,

650
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,760
to enjoy one's endless life.

651
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,080
Riding the wind and breaking the waves, is a long way away,

652
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,560
for what is the worry

653
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,240
of staying in the spring?

654
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,000
Yannian

655
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,200
Qiaonian

656
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,000
You are going to work and study in France.

657
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,920
Brewed for five years. 

658
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,240
Everything comes to him who waits 

659
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,720
be before leaving/departure

660
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,040
There's still something I want to tell you.

661
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,000
You know who I am.

662
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,760
Don't say I have to panic

663
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,600
As far as I know

664
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,320
European war ends economic depression

665
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
France has a high unemployment rate. 

666
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,400
More importantly,

667
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,720
Their present national government is an empty shelf. 

668
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,320
No financial resources

669
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,640
Live by borrowing money from foreign countries.

670
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,320
Such a government-funded Sino-French university

671
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,840
Is it reliable?

672
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,760
so

673
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,600
You should be prepared for not going to school.

674
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,560
Mr. Wu Zhihui.

675
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,080
Will you hear me out?

676
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,960
To be honest, for going to France for work-study program 

677
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
I have reservations.

678
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,600
Thousands of people passed at once. 

679
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,760
The language doesn't pass.

680
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,160
And there is not enough money.

681
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,920
Everyone can't learn. 

682
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
If you don't get it, it will probably become

683
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,160
A big social problem

684
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,000
We are mentally prepared for difficulties.

685
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,160
Don't worry about that.

686
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,040
I worry

687
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,400
I'm worried about more than that.

688
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,240
And your faith.

689
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,760
You don't have to worry about this either.

690
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,760
我跟桥埝

691
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,600
We are both people of faith.

692
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,080
I know, especially you, Yannian

693
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
I know you have a problem with anarchism.

694
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,640
Yes, it has been deeply studied and understood.

695
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
In Shanghai with Huang Lingshuang and others.

696
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,080
Also organized the evolution society.

697
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,320
Editor-in-Chief of Evolution Monthly and Series

698
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,440
He was also wanted by the government and the patrol house.

699
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,800
I all know

700
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,040
Your motive is to save the country by loving others.

701
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,000
But you're interested

702
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,360
Anarchism's obsession and preference

703
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,360
That's what I'm worried about.

704
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,360
Our choice of faith

705
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
After a long period of comparison and verification.

706
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,160
I have also undergone long-term comparison and verification.

707
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,560
Yannian

708
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,280
I also tried to 

709
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,000
Trying to use the theory and principle of mutual aid theory

710
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,840
To save China.

711
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
But will it work?

712
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,960
Have you ever thought about it?

713
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,680
You started that work-study mutual aid society at first.

714
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
What is the real reason for the failure?

715
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,120
I thought I thought now

716
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
Essential reason

717
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,040
Is to improve China bit by bit.

718
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,160
It won't work

719
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,760
If China wants to strengthen itself

720
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,240
You have to go through a game

721
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,560
Continuous revolutionary changes.

722
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,120
It's still too early for you to draw this conclusion.

723
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,840
Not early

724
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,800
We have been waiting in line for a long time.

725
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,320
We have arrived.

726
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,320
When you have to make up your mind.

727
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Yannian Qiaonian

728
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,400
I just hope you won't be too stubborn.

729
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,480
Too superstitious about a theory

730
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
Take time to read it.

731
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
Marx's works

732
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,760
To study the present situation of Soviet Russia.

733
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,280
Don't just reject it. 

734
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,120
Okay?

735
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,040
We accept your suggestion.

736
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,600
good

737
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,040
good

738
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,160
As a father

739
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,040
I should have cared for you.

740
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,000
Grow up healthily and live safely.

741
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
But as a father

742
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,840
How much I wish

743
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,240
The three of us.

744
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,760
To be able to one day

745
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,040
In the same trench.

746
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
For our troubled country

747
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
To do something.

748
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,080
This is also what we hope.

749
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,320
good

750
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,280
Pack your things.

751
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,720
Chen Duxiu moved out last week.

752
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
His Peking University office supplies.

753
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,840
Zhou Wei and Li Dazhao and others 

754
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,040
Went to the Great Wall.

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,520
Yesterday, he gave a lecture in a higher normal school.

756
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,000
This is the content of the report. 

757
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,480
People like Chen Duxiu

758
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
Cho still wants it.

759
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,560
But that is, people should be learned.

760
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,360
I can't let him out of your sight

761
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,960
He can't find you again.

762
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,120
Especially now.

763
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,240
North-South Peace Period

764
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,800
No, because something else happened to him.

765
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
But?

766
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
As long as nothing big happens recently.

767
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,960
You can also relax.

768
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,400
Brothers also work hard.

769
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,400
That is based on the principle of no accident. 

770
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,760
clear

771
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,640

Later, Shizhi and I were talking about something and couldn't get away.
