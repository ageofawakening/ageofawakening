00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:07,522
[Episode Twenty-one]

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,880
President Xu Shichang asked me to tell you.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
The mood of the government of the Republic of China and Qingdao people 

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,880
It's the same as the wish.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,480
Attending the Paris Peace Conference

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,320
Government delegation of the Republic of China

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
Has successfully arrived in Paris.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,040
They will join the victorious countries.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,880
Discuss and resolve

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,760
Relations and interests between China and Germany after the war

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,120
Safeguard China's sovereignty and the interests of the people.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,640
French, British and Italian ambassadors to China

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,000
After hearing the news

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,240
Please give my regards to everyone.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,280
They will uphold the principle of fairness and justice. 

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,520
Safeguard China's sovereignty

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,640
Guarantee the territorial integrity of big and small countries.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,240
And political independence.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
So we have reason to believe

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
in the near future

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,040
Shandong Peninsula will be completely returned to China.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
good

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,440
because

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,680
After all, we are 

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,760
The winner of this world war.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,760
We have reason to get the fruits of victory. 

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,640
Long live China, long live China! 

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,840
Long live China, long live China, long live China 

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,600
On the verge of success.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
It happened that this incident happened. 

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu, they 

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,880
It's a good way to see everything.

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
Didn't Congress accept it before?

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,200
Did Black Rabbit Cai Yuanpei make a proposal? 

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,880
Why did you call back again?

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
It wasn't the petition group that caused it.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Because the European war was won. 

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,440
The patriotic enthusiasm of Chinese people is unprecedentedly high.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,120
Now there's another Qingdao petition group.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,480
Immediately won the support of the people.

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
And the North and South governments are at odds.

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
Has always been complained of by the people.

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,240
It's hard to catch a Paris peace conference

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,680
Can you distract yourself?

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
At this juncture.

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
Naturally, there will be no more trouble.

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
It's called back.

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,440
These old things are really old and good hunting. 

50
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,560
Uncle, what should we do next?

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,320
You are in Peking University every day

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
You didn't notice.

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,520
What are their new trends?

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,040
There's one thing.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Jinwan

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,200
Go to that house.

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,040
Uncle Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu have taken the lead recently.

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,960
Set up a work-study mutual aid society.

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
Said to experiment with anarchism.

60
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,080
And communism.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
Also recruit for the society.

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
There are quite a few people.

63
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,600
Come from other places to sign up. 

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
Mutual assistance agency

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,880
communism

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,120
Go back to school.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Keep an eye on this support society.

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
Do you think there are articles to do here?

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
This kind of immoral, toothy society

70
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
Have responsibility and obligation.

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,800
Expose their true faces to the people.

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
Okay, I got it

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
Come and sit down.

74
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,200
I am in a really good mood today.

75
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,600
It's the truth that we help each other every word.

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
Come on, come on, sit down 

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
Come and listen to Yannian.

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
Say something.

79
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,040
Students have moved their stools.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
Let's sit down.

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,680
Let's have a formal meeting today.

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
classmates

83
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
Today is a memorable day.

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
Our Beijing Gongdu Mutual Aid Society

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,880
The first experimental group was born.

86
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,200
Students, from now on

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Is a member of a big family.

89
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
Everyone in the society calls each other comrades.

90
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,760
Do you have any objection?

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,560
agree

92
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,840
Agreed, agreed, agreed

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,040
start from today

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,760
We just have

95
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
Comrades with common ideals and beliefs.

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,480
All right, comrades.

97
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,520
Let's introduce ourselves to each other first.

98
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,640
Who comes first?

99
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,240
I'll go first.

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,040
come

101
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Hello, comrades. My name is Shi Cuntong

102
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,520
Zhejiang Jinhua people

103
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,720
Born in 1899

104
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,800
Is a student of Zhejiang No.1 Normal School.

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
The reason why I came to Beijing

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
Join our work-study mutual aid society.

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,400
Because I yearn for

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
I yearn for a kind of anarchy

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
No power, no law

110
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
No religion and no marriage

111
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
Ideal life without family

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
And I think our work-study mutual aid society

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,480
This is the life.

114
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
I understand the so-called work-study mutual assistance

115
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
Is labor.

116
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
It's hard work.

117
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,880
Mutual assistance is evolution.

118
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,520
Our members work hard at the same time 

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Lifelong work and lifelong learning

120
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,200
find it an infinite delight/a boundless joy (to do sth) 

121
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I hereby swear to all comrades.

122
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,640
from this day onwards

123
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,480
I am the club and I am the club.

124
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,840
The interests of the society

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
It is my personal interest, Shi Cuntong.

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,640
nicely

127
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,640
I am the same as Shi Cuntong.

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,480
They are all students of Zhejiang No.1 Normal School.

132
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,760
I gave it to my parents yesterday.

133
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
Wrote a long letter.

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,000
The letter explained in detail.

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
Why should I come to Beijing?

136
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
The reasons for joining the work-study mutual aid society

137
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
It mentions

138
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,480
My purpose

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,160
Trying to experiment with my ideal life.

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
Want to spread to all mankind.

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
Let them enjoy this sweet taste together.

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,720
A new life of happiness, fraternity, mutual assistance and freedom 

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,680
To be finished.

144
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,960
good

145
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,320
Hello, everybody!

Now I'm studying in a French specialized school.

Yeah, me too.

Maowei maowei

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
Hello, comrades. My name is Yi Qunxian

156
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,360
I ran out because I opposed my parents' forced marriage.

157
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm here for the same reason as Comrade He.

158
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
Is to want to live a free and open life 

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
no

160
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:39,600


161
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,600
Okay, this is the notebook of our mutual aid society.

162
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,520
Let's pass it on and talk about it.

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,400
Let's use it as a canteen.

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Work-study property public ownership

176
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,320

Our property status

179
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,760
good

180

Let me show you.

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,600
The three of us are doing distribution in New Youth.

190
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,440
Bai Lan works as a tutor in the embassy district. 

191
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,560
Keep doing all this.

192
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
It's just that wages must be paid to the public.

193
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
Now we have implemented three businesses.

194
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,400
It's a work-study canteen that needs six people.

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,640
Second, it takes four people to wash clothes. 

196
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
Third, it takes three people to show the movie.

197
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,840
These three businesses

198
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
Let's discuss it.

199
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
No need to discuss

200
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,240
I'll run the canteen. 

201
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,840
Xin gang Yan nian

202
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
Lanliumei

203
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
If you guys have nothing to do at ordinary times.

204
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,920
Just come and help me. 

205
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,960
OK no problem

206
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
No problem. I'll tell you what.

207
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
Qingdao will be back soon.

208
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,000
Lao Guo is in a good mood these two days.

209
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
Stop helping you.

210
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,640
You can be a servant.

211
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
Then I'll do the laundry.

212
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,600
Count me in!

213
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,720
Count me in too.

214
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
Count me in too.

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,480
good

216
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,080
I can't do anything.

217
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,440
I play movies.

218
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
Nothing. That's easy 

219
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
You know nothing.

220
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,440
Came to the support group.

221
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,840
It's difficult to show movies.

222
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,360
You won't have to.

223
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
good

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,880
Good point!

225
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,840
good

226
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,880
Good point!

227
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
Ok, everyone slept soundly.

228
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,880
Let you sleep

229
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,680
Let you sleep

230
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:03,920
Who?

231
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,640
You who ah

232
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,520
Yu Xiusong

233
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,040
Get up. What time is it?

234
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
I said what are you yelling about in the middle of the night?

235
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,280
Are you sleepwalking?

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,320
Most of the night

237
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,160
Still asleep, still asleep

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,040
Why?

239
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,960
Don't get up.

240
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you calling for in the middle of the night? 

241
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Do you know what time it is in the middle of the night

242
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,760
Do you know what day it is today?

243
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,320
What date?

244
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,560
What Bai Zi?

245
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,680
Qiao nian, don't drag my quilt.

246
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Today is the first day of the work-study canteen.

247
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
Buy rice at 6: 30

248
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
It's six o'clock now. 

249
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
I almost missed something big.

250
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,400
Qiao nian, wake up, wake up 

251
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
What's up? The chicken hasn't crowed yet.

252
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
What's the noise when it's dawn?

253
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,680
You clean up

254
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,560
Get up quickly

255
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
Why do you go

256
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,760
They waited all night for their crowing.

257
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,280
I'll pack them up.

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,520
Lao Guo, go and shout for lesbians 

259
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
Returning a lesbian

260
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,160
Lesbians got up early to help.

261
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,160
You gay men are worse than lesbians.

262
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
lose face

263
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,720
Come, come, eat, eat

264
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,480
come over

265
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,520
Go for dinner

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
It's time for you not to scream.

267
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
I almost got up late.

268
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,280
You don't crow when you should crow. 

269
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,880
Do you know what you do?

270
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,080
Comrades who got up late. 

271
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
Go back to pick up the recommendation and sleep.

272
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Let me tell the sun.

273
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Let it come out later.

274
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,520
Our gay man who got up late.

275
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,760
To get up early first, lesbians.

276
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,520
No, don't, don't be unbearable.

277
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,120
Comrades who got up late. 

278
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
Why don't you go back to sleep?

279
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,920
I don't need you here.

280
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,480
come on

281
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,520


282
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,840
The gay man who got up late.

283
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,680
Look at your lesbian who gets up early.

284
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
And comrade hai Wei who didn't sleep.

285
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,720
Put this yard

286
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
And how beautifully the hearth is cleaned.

287
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,120
Thanks to our Shandong chef.

288
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
Gay men who get up late, go back to sleep.

289
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,560
The lesbian who gets up early doesn't feel tired when she works. 

290
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,960
Comrade Yannian, listen carefully.

291
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,120
The frugal canteen opens today. 

292
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,160
What was it again?

293
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
The best in China

294
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,800
Yes, yes, yes

295
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,680
hurry up

296
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,760
come on

297
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,240
Open for business

298
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,120
Open for a walk

299
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,840
Yes, yes, yes

300
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,440
good

301
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,840
Is that OK

302
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,440
nicely

303
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,200
Comrades

304
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,840
Clean canteen is our home.

305
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
Come on, comrades!

306
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,640
oil; fuel charging; make a greater effort

307
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,520
open

308
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,240
work

309
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,280
Go to work

310
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
Time is like running water

311
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
I'll be home from school after class.

312
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,320
Let's think it over for a while.

313
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
Did you understand today's lesson?

314
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,600
Did the teacher ever violate what he said?

315
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,000
Looking forward to your parents' return.

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
We don't follow all the way.

317
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,840
Governing the country in the future.

318
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,440
Depends on our generation.

319
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,920
Everybody work hard.

320
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,160
See you again tomorrow, classmates.

321
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,040
oil; fuel charging; make a greater effort

322
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:18,560


323
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:18,720
Youbing steamed bun

324
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,360
Youbing steamed bun

325
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,440


326
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:19,680
Youbing steamed bun

327
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:19,760


328
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,320
Youbing steamed bun

329
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,400


330
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Fresh-baked oil cake

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Come and try it.

332
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
Yes, please try the oil cake.

333
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,240
And steamed buns.

334
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,360
Clean and cheap.

335
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
Keep coughing, keep coughing

336
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,800
Sell breakfast here

337
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,760
Morning, sir

338
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,520
Come on, come on, class.

339
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,120
Our first order guest today 

340
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,160
welcome

341
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:36,960
Yes, sir.

342
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,840
Hello, Mr. Shizhi

343
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,800
Good morning, everyone.

344
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,240
sir

345
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
It's still hot just after coming out of the pot. 

346
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Please have one. 

347
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
Mr. Shizhi, have some oil cakes and steamed buns. 

348
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
We are cheap here.

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,720
Yes, try it.

350
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,480
Okay, I'll have a taste.

351
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,840
scented

352
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,160
yes or no 

353
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,560
how about

354
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,840
It smells good.

355
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,400
yes or no 

356
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,760
Try some more.

357
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,560
Try them all. Try them all.

358
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,640
I think we should be frugal in the canteen.

359
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
We have to publicize it.

360
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,240
Find a newspaper to sponsor advertising.

361
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Put those four words at the door and that couplet

362
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
Shoot it and board it.

363
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,440
That's your recruitment.

364
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
Right.

365
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,640
The four words on our plaque were written by Mr Cai.

366
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,400
This couplet on both sides

367
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,520
It was written by Mr Lu Xun.

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,240
Ah, look!

369
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,200
Such a good resource.

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,640
You didn't make good use of it.

371
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,840
Isn't it a pity?

372
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,280
Good idea, sir.

373
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,040
Our student union can also help.

374
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll have to trouble you then.

375
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,520
Everybody make good use of this resource.

376
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
Do you have steamed stuffed bun and oil cake?

377
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,760

classmates

381
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,520
Your second business is here.

382
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Shizhi, you also come to buy breakfast

383
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm not here to buy breakfast.

384
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
I am their volunteer propagandist.

385
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,520
寿昌先生

386
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
Today is our frugal canteen.

387
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,840
Open on the first day

388
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,280
How can you support us?

389
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm here to pay tribute.

390
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,440
This place is really nice.

391
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
Okay, okay, okay.

392
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,560
Yannian

393
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,240
An oil cake and a bowl of porridge 

394
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,280
Yes, sir, please sit down.

395
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,680
good

396
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
An oil cake and a bowl of porridge 

397
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,280
good

398
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,200
An oil cake and a bowl of porridge are not enough.

399
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
Mr. Shouchang is so big

400
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Must have three oil cakes and three bowls of porridge.

401
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
I can't eat so much.

402
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
How many oil cakes did you eat?

403
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,680
I have family rules.

404
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,200
I can't eat breakfast outside.

405
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
Do you have any money?

406
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,920
Yannian

407
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,280
Ge you bing San wan Zhou

408
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400
I ate here with Mr. Shizhi.

409
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,120
寿昌兄

410
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,080
Yannian

411
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
No, family rules are family rules.

412
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,640
I can't break it

413
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,360
You know what?

414
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
I'll give you Dong Xiu Wan Zi tomorrow morning.

415
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Stop making breakfast.

416
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,960
Let's have breakfast together in Jianjie canteen. 

417
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,360
how about

418
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,320
Good!

419
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm leaving, brother Shouchang

420
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,080
Students work hard!

421
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,040
See you later.

422
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,760
Goodbye, sir.

423
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,400
Sir, walk slowly.

424
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,160
Lao Guo

425
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm leaving, too

426
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
I will come again tomorrow.

427
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,640
I can give you an account. 

428
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,280
Hang in the balance.

429
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,160
Come tomorrow.

430
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,880
see you tomorrow

431
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Come tomorrow.

432
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,520
Little fatty can eat quite well. 

433
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,320
This fat man

434
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,400
Yannian

435
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,760
come

436
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
Here are ten oceans for you.

437
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,720
I will come here for breakfast every day in the future.

438
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,600
This is inappropriate, sir.

439
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,360
All your money goes to the poor.

440
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Don't listen to them.

441
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,080
Mr. Cai actually deducts thirty dollars a month.

442
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
Send it directly to my wife. 

443
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
So I have no worries here.

444
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,880
You also don't have any ideas.

445
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,800
Thank you, sir.

446
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,720
a slap in the face 

447
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,760
Comrades

448
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,080
The first official business

449
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,280
Ten oceans

450
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,840
Business is booming

451
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,280
Thank you, sir.

452
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,840
Say you're such a big man.

453
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,760
What are you angry with the children about? 

454
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,200
I'm ashamed of you.

455
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,400
You can't talk nonsense

456
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm not angry with him.

457
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,240
You're not angry with them. 

458
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
Why don't you let me go to the frugal canteen to buy breakfast? 

459
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,280
dad

460
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
I also want to eat breakfast cooked by Yannian's brother. 

461
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,160
I want to eat, too./I also want to eat 

462
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,840
Where is there food at home? 

463
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,360
Why do you want to buy it?

464
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,840
There is no place to spend money. 

465
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,960
You said you

466
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
The frugal canteen opened on the first day today.

467
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,400
I shouldn't have given them a boost.

468
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,480
You went today, will you go tomorrow?

469
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
Since it is an experiment, it needs objective facts.

470
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
The results are valuable.

471
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,800
Let them rely on themselves.

472
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,080
All right, let's eat.

473
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,440
Why do you go

474
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,560
I filled all the porridge for you.

475
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,680
i'm full

476
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm going to have a look.

477
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,560
Digestive food

478
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,040
Stop wiping.

479
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,200
This table is polished like a mirror. 

480
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,560
There's not a guest here. Why are you cleaning it? 

481
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,240
What's going on?

482
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
You can't sell a single cake.

483
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,160
Don't blow it up. 

484
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,360
What's the use of frying so much?

485
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,120
It's a waste not to blow up any guests. 

486
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,760
If it's not you, how can I prick my ears?

487
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,960
What is waste?

488
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,400
This cake won't sell.

489
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,320
Is that there is something wrong with your recruitment.

490
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,360
We pulled it

491
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,240
I've been pulling people all morning

492
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,280
What are you talking about?

493
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,160
You made the cake. There is something wrong with it.

494
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,040
I'm telling you, you have technical problems.

495
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,320
I have technical problems.

496
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:28,720
right

497
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
Mr. Hu Shi my cake was delicious. 

498
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
Then I don't think your cake is delicious.

499
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,120
Why don't you go out and get people?

500
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
A group of people have been sitting there all morning.

501
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,160
Lao Guo is asleep.

502
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,800
Why don't you go?

503
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,760
OK

504
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,360
Let's open on the first day today. 

505
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
It's normal for people to have concerns.

506
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
Take your time. It can't wait.

507
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
Why do you have concerns?

508
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,720
Why don't you go?

509
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,240
Okay, okay, I won't tell you

510
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,280
Love what you want.

511
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,080
What attitude are you?

512
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,600
It's urgent.

513
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,400
everyone

514
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,560
Business is booming

515
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,120
Hello, Mr. Zhongfu

516
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,840
Hello, Mr. Zhongfu

517
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,040
Please sit down, sir.

518
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,000
Please, please

519
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,800
Please sit down, sir.

520
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
Make room for sir. Go, go, go

521
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,200
come on

522
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Sit down, sir.

523
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
中富先生

524
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,920
You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

525
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,000
No, no, no.

526
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,720
What can I get you?

527
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
What do you have here?

528
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,160
How many do we have here

529
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,800
Don't sell

530
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,720
Why don't you sell it? 

531
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,040
Yannian

532
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,480
Don't need sympathy

533
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,760
Chen Yannian

534
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,360
This is our business.

535
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,120
It's not up to you alone.

536
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,760
You laugh, sir.

537
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,880
Let me introduce it to you.

538
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,680
We have porridge, steamed buns and oil cakes here. 

539
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,480
And soybean milk.

540
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,280
And soybean milk is still

541
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,640
I got up in the morning and polished it.

542
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,520
Then have a pea paste.

543
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
And an oil cake.

544
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,760
good

545
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,640
One is not enough.

546
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,200
Sir, Mr. Dazhao was here this morning.

547
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
He ordered three cakes of oil by himself.

548
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,840
Three pea pulp

549
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,960
He eats so much!

550
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,520
right

551
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,560
Then give me two oil cakes.

552
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
Yiwan soybean milk

553
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,160
good

554
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,800
Deyoude

555
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,000
Okay, okay, I'll go. I'll go

556
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,360
Please wait a moment, sir.

557
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,320
This is a pro-fresh cake

558
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll give you a Zhang Gang first. 

559
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,040
not bad

560
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
Try the freshly ground soybean milk. 

561
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,800
nicely

562
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,240
good

563
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
You guys get busy.

564
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,400
okay

565
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,440
Enjoy your meal, sir.

566
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Please enjoy your meal, sir.

567
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,840
Look at what I do in this business. 

568
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,160
Comrades

569
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,800
Our frugal canteen opened on the first day today.

570
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,880
Although it is a small business

571
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
but

572
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
First, we don't accept sympathy from others.

573
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,920
Second, account cancellation is not allowed.

574
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,160
Then Fu Sinian gets up in the morning. 

575
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
But I just hung up the bill.

576
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,320
Fu Sinian is a student.

577
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
From now on, except students

578
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,760
No one can give away the account.

579
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,680
Lao Guo

580
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,360
You keep an eye on it.

581
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,960
If you don't pay for dinner today

582
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,080
Don't let him out of this door.

583
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
We must resolutely resist freeloading.

584
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,280
Say who

585
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,320
What is self-sufficient?

586
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,440
Innuendo

587
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
Why do you eat and eat, and you are anxious?

588
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,120
You don't have any money. 

589
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,640
I I I

590
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,240
I left in a hurry. I forgot.

591
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,560
That won't do.

592
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
What should I do if you don't have any money?

593
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,240
What can I do?

594
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,200
I'm-I'm-I'm back

595
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm sure I'll give you the meal then. 

596
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,240
How can I trust you?

597
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,120
If you go out and run away

598
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,320
Then where can I find you?

599
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,760
I-I-I-Where am I going?

600
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Then I don't know.

601
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,880
Look, have you eaten the oil cake? 

602
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,600
Eat

603
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,400
Have you drunk soybean milk?

604
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,440
Take a sip.

605
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,640
Then a sip is a drink.

606
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,760
Isn't that a freeloader?

607
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,800
What a freeloader!

608
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,840
Didn't I tell you?

609
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
I'll send it to you when I get the money back.

610
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,040
Resolutely can't cancel the account

611
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,400
I've heard it.

612
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
Didn't Fu Sinian pay the bill, too?

613
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
That's different from you in Fu Sinian.

614
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,640
Who are you?

615
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
How much do you earn a month?

616
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,560
What should I do then?

617
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,840
I just forgot my money.

618
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,360
I forgot my money. Why?

619
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,720
I'll take off my clothes for you.

620
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,520
No, no, no

621
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,640
We can't take your clothes.

622
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,000
That way.

623
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,520
We are anarchist.

624
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
Communist mutual aid society

625
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,880
Follow the principle of mutual assistance.

626
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,160
No laborer can eat.

627
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,800
Wash the dishes to settle the bill.

628
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,760
wash the bowl up

629
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,200
That doesn't work

630
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,920
Chopping firewood, washing clothes and feeding chickens

631
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,680
Squeeze goat milk and grind soybean milk

632
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,280
And the paste envelope.

633
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,720
Anything. You choose.

634
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Okay, I'll do the dishes. 

635
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,920
Mr. Zhongfu, how can you wash the dishes?

636
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
No, no, no.

637
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,240
Follow your rules.

638
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,840
A man without money is no man at all.

639
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,560
I wash dishes

640
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
Please eat first, then wash after eating.

641
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
I'll wash it before eating it.

642
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,880
Otherwise, I can't eat steadily.

643
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Can you beat me? This

644
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,920
Where are your bowls?

645
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,680
I'm really sorry.

646
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
You haven't finished your meal yet.

647
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,440
You have to wash your own dishes after eating. 

648
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,040
Do not prolong life

649
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Chen Yannian

650
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,480
You're trying to squeeze your old man, aren't you? 

651
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,920
Who pushed you right?

652
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,240
Good teacher and mother

653
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,680
You too

654
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,120
Let your dad wash your dishes.

655
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,520
He hasn't smashed all your bowls yet.

656
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
I knew you didn't have any money. 

657
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,560
Laiyannian

658
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,480
This is the money your father gave you.

659
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
Comrades, the third deal

660
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,400
Thank you, guests

661
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,080
carry to

662
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
Thank you, Mr. Zhongfu.

663
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
Didn't you have breakfast this morning?

664
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm not full

665
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
Originally this morning

666
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm here to give you a boost first.

667
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,360
As a result, your father didn't agree.

668
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
Don't let me come anyway.

669
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,520
As a result, I beat you to it.

670
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,320
The point is, I haven't brought my money.

671
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,040
Liumeibailan

672
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm here for the first time today.

673
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,840
Show me around.

674
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,480
Ok.

675
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,600
This is our chicken and duck.

676
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,800
This is common property.

677
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,840
That's the laundry room.

678
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,840
Good, good, good.

679
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,120
You let go

680
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
You let go

681
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,680
You let go

682
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,480
I won't let go.

683
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,280
Into the mutual aid society.

684
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,720
There must be all communist consciousness.

685
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
This is my personal property. Why should I be communist? 

686
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,960
You let go

687
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,920
Will you let go?

688
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,800
I won't let go.

689
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,680
Don't you let me shout?

690
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,480
You shout

691
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,720
Yu Xiusong

692
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,760
Why let go?

693
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,960
Comrade Chen Yannian, you're just in time.

694
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,320
You give a comment.

695
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Join the Mutual Aid Society to Realize Communism

696
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,160
I was so excited that I stayed up all night.

697
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,560
get down

698
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
I put all my clothes away.

699
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,240
get down

700
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
Now that we're communist

701
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,040
There can be no more private property.

702
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,200
I laid out all the clothes I brought.

703
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,400
I think Comrade Yu is a rich boy. 

704
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,800
I came to mobilize him to put out his clothes.

705
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,240
There are three New Pants here.

706
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,600
Guess what?

707
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
He refused.

708
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,480
How unreasonable is your lesbian?

709
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,080
Give me some comments.

710
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
She came to open my box early in the morning.

711
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,560
Let me hand in my clothes. 

712
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,920
This box is full of my personal effects.

713
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,960
And school equipment.

714
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
Yes, there are pants in it.

715
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
Those are gay pants. You can't wear them either.

716
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,160
Unreasonable

717
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,760
Who said I was going to wear your pants?

718
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,760
I can't wear your pants.

719
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,520
But other comrades can wear it.

720
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,680
What's wrong with you?

721
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,120
You have three New Pants here.

722
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,600
Can't you share it with the pants that are worn out?

723
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,440
Or comrades with only one pair of pants?

724
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,680
You are still elected by the Social Committee.

725
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,960
selfish

726
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
I am selfish.

727
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
You're a pants guy, aren't you?

728
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
Your left pair of pants and your right pair of pants. 

729
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
Who says communism must hand in pants?

730
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
Is there such a clause in the constitution of our work-study mutual aid society?

731
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,520
All right, stop arguing.

732
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,440
Do you want to share the members' clothes? 

733
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,120
There are no clear rules yet.

734
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
You have this idea?

735
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
It can be submitted to the general assembly for voting.

736
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,480
Until then, keep it as it is. 

737
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,520
start a meal

738
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,520
chairman of the committee

739
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,960
Chief Chen has arrived

740
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,080
great-uncle

741
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,240
What important documents?

742
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,080
Chief Chen has to deliver it himself.

743
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
See for yourself.

744
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,960
What's going on here?

745
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
Refuse to accept the return as it is

746
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,160
What's the matter?

747
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,520
Last night, Japanese Ambassador to China Xiao+met with me.

748
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,120
And ministers from the United States, Britain, Italy and France.

749
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,640
Claiming the core of the Shandong Peninsula issue

750
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,480
Not in the interests of China and Germany.

751
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,400
But the interests of Japan and Germany.

752
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,200
We asked that at the Paris Peace Conference

753
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,040
Don't rock the boat.

754
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,200
Early this morning

755
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,880
President Xu took me and Wu Bingxiang.

756
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
Find it together

757
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,120
I demand that this petition be folded with all people.

758
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,560
Return it to you. 

759
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,040
Ask Wu Bingxiang to take measures 

760
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,400
Slogans and leaflets can no longer appear on the streets of Beijing. 

761
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,840
Followed by the History Museum of the United States, Britain, France and Italy.

762
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,120
Also return all the call letters from Qingdao.

763
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,720
outrageous

764
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Can the spilled water be recovered?

765
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,760
What does Xu Shichang want? 

766
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,760
Make fun of me as a monkey

767
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,120
Don't you want Qingdao?

768
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,040
President Xu also asked me to tell you

769
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,120
Qingdao still wants it.

770
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
But pay attention to strategy. 

771
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,120
Don't boil the Japanese.

772
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,120
lack of forbearance in a trivial matter will spoil the whole 

773
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
He knows how to endure.

774
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,560
Be patient when you are defeated.

775
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,080
If you win, you have to endure it.

776
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,480
I think this country is possessed.

777
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,360
Weak countries have no diplomacy. It's an iron law.

778
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,480
What's the axiom?

779
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,160
What about the Shikoku Museum?

780
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,040
Wilson's words don't count either?

781
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
When the American embassy returned the letter 

782
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
Special emphasis

783
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,040
America's attitude towards China

784
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,720
Has always been consistent.

785
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,600
I don't think so.

786
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,520
This is the signal.

787
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,680
Paris peace conference will cause trouble.

788
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,560
Already in trouble.

789
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,160
what's up

790
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,680
The delegation received

791
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,120
When ranking people in China

792
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,400
It's already exploded.

793
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,040
Wang Zhengting cursed President Xu.

794
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,640
Discrimination against the southern government

795
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,400
Ke Sze Sao wiped the carrying pole with its load 

796
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,720
Lu Zhengxiang simply went to Switzerland.

797
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
Now it's all up to Gu Weijun to do Zhou Xuan.

798
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,240
This is to be expected.

799
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,920
I have given it to Lu Zhengxiang separately.

800
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,280
And Gu Weijun sent a telegram.

801
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,280
Daily by Gu Weijun.

802
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,560
When it's critical, Lu Zhengxiang must come out. 

803
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,920
The chairman's campaign won a thousand miles.

804
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,280
command admiration

805
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,000
Trouble is still at home.

806
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,200
Cao Rulin Zhang Zongxiang Lu Zongxing

807
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,400
These people are disgusting.

808
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,320
The pro-Japanese faction can't be underestimated.

809
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,280
after all is said 

810
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
Still depends on the foreigners' faces.

811
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,480
What a loser!

812
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,440
please

813
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,720
It was recommended by Mr. Dazhao. 

814
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,680
right

815
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,960
Okay, sit down.

816
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,440
thank you

817
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,280
What about the Gongdu Mutual Aid Society?

818
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
It is a new thing that everyone is very concerned about. 

819
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Of course, it is also of interest to our newspaper.

820
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,520
It has been reported before

821
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,600
Miss Liu, come here this time 

822
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,880
What about this list provided?

823
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,680
In principle?

824
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,600
It can be classified as social news. 

825
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
We have no problem publishing it. 

826
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,000
But this canteen you mentioned

827
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,800
Laundry agency

828
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
Including the introduction of the film screening group.

829
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,840
Actually, it belongs to advertising category.

830
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,200
There is a charge.

831
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
Miss Liu, do you know?

832
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,280
The Gongdu Mutual Aid Society is full of students. 

833
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,920
Work-study is work-study program.

834
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,560
We must have no money to advertise.

835
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm here to apply.

836
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
See if your newspaper can sponsor us.

837
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,240
How about you, Miss Liu?

838
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,680
Actually, it's embarrassing for us.

839
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,040
Because of your sponsorship

840
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,360
It is difficult to pass at the board meeting.

841
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,280
I can give you an idea. 

842
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,760
You say

843
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,920
Not only do you not have to advertise

844
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,520
Just need to write a press release.

845
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,960
You find a reporter.

846
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,480
Put your canteens

847
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,560
Including laundry service.

848
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,240
Include a film screening group. 

849
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,680
Do an interview in a unified way

850
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
Write a press release.

851
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,280
Not only can it be published in newspapers

852
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,240
And other media will reprint it.

853
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,520
In this case

854
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,960
Not only didn't it cost a penny

855
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,880
And this kind of influence

856
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,800
It will also produce great results

857
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,640
That's good.

858
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,760
Or ask the editor-in-chief

859
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,360
Let's write a report.

860
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,560
Little girl

861
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,800
You are still too honest. 

862
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,600
Not only do you have to find this reporter yourself.

863
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
It's better to be a columnist.

864
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,680
If you're lucky.

865
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,680
Maybe he will even pay you an interview fee.

866
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,360
I don't know your business either.

867
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,480
I don't know where to start.

868
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
Go to a reporter like this.

869
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
Mr. Xie

870
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,280
You are half-hearted during this work.

871
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,560
It's against the social rules.

872
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,000
Lao Zhang, you're here

873
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,280
Here, the manuscript has been delivered to you.

874
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,240
good

875
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,360
such

876
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,680
Miss Liu, you are so lucky.

877
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,120
Let me introduce you.

878
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,240
And this one?

879
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,560
It's from our column "Learning from the Sea"

880
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,680
person in charge

881
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,880
And he also serves as Beijing and Shanghai.

882
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,640
Special principals of several newspapers

883
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,240
Come and meet you.

884
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,720
hello

885
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,680
Hello, hello.

886
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,880
By the way, Lao Zhang

887
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,400
I thought you said earlier.

888
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
You don't really want to know.

889
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,280
This work-study mutual aid society?

890
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,960
Then help this Miss Liu.

891
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,600
Work-study mutual aid society is a good subject.

892
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,120
I'm very interested.

893
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

894
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,200
Then let's talk somewhere.

895
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,720
Isn't it nice here?

896
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,840
How can it be here?

897
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,600
The interview is not a matter of three or two sentences. 

898
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,040
There is a cafe next to this. 

899
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,920
It's my treat.

900
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,640
line

901
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,440
Please go.

902
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:12,960
Let's go, bitter

903
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,520
Don't bother to see me out.

904
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,400
Thank you, editor-in-chief

905
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:14,800
don't mention it

906
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,280
Thank you

907
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,800
classmates

908
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,120
The mutual help frugal canteen has opened.

909
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,000
Come next time.

910
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,840
Tired of school meals

911
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,440
Students, come here.

912
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,440
Yannian

913
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,000
Come and find out.

914
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,480
Yannian

915
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:29,920
Yannian

916
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,680
Yannian

917
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,600
Let me introduce you to some students from the English department.

918
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
They asked if they could pack food and wash clothes.

919
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,200
Then check out monthly.

920
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,400
Give some discount.

921
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,040
Xinxing, no problem

922
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,000
Let's come here to discuss.

923
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,640
Who are you looking for when you wash clothes?

924
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,840
Wash clothes over there. 

925
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,640
Pack up here.

926
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
I'll make arrangements for you again.

927
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,640
okay

928
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,080
We have a Shandong man there.

929
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,880
Cooking is particularly good.

930
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,320
There were only two people interested in this movie ticket for half a day.

931
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,040
What should I do? 

932
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
You guys are so stubborn.

933
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,560
Where have you seen a group of gentlemen?

934
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,440
Group to watch movies.

935
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,960
There are no girls in Peking University.

936
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,560
Who are you selling movie tickets to?

937
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
So you Peking University students don't watch movies?

938
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,120
Let's see.

939
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,880
I went to other schools to accompany my female classmates.

940
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,480
If you really want to sell the tickets

941
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,560
I'll think of a way for you 

942
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,040
Yi qunxian

943
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,000
Coming

944
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,040
Yi qunxian

945
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,160
Come here.

946
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,680
Come here, class.

947
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
Help you solve this problem right away.

948
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,680
I'd like to introduce a female classmate to you today. 

949
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,240
Hello

950
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm Xie Wanying of Concord Women's College Prep.

951
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,440
hello

952
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,240
Hello, hello.

953
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,520
Are there many girls in your school?

954
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,960
We are a women's university.

955
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,480
Women's University

956
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,400
Do your school boys watch movies with girls?

957
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,440
talk nonsense

958
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,720
Do you think everyone is like you? 

959
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,280
It's very cheap for us to package laundry here.

960
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
We can also have dinner in groups. 

961
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,800
Movie tickets must be popular in your school.

962
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,200
People can't hear you clearly.

963
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,120
You say it one by one.

964
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,320
sir

965
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,760
Let's report to you.

966
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,400
About establishment

967
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,840
About the civilian education lecture group.

968
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,040
Tell me about it.

969
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,560
According to your last suggestion?

970
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,760
Our "National Trendy"

971
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,040
And the Marquez Institute.

972
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,920
Several societies

973
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,880
We discussed it together.

974
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,120


975
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,360


976
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:57,920
decision

977
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,800
First at Peking University

978
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,080
Set up a school night shift.

979
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,520
That is, night classes for workers.

980
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,960
Three nights a week

981
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,400
Popularize culture to workers. 

982
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,120
Explain current events

983
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,560
And then we decided

984
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,760
On this basis

985
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,960
Be officially established

986
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,000
Civilian education lecture group

987
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,480
eh

988
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,440
To all sectors of society

989
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,400
To recruit companions.

990
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,520
this is us

991
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,800
Draft brochure

992
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,760
And recruitment notices.

993
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,880
Have a look.

994
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,120


995
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,440
good

996
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,040
This matter has something to do with Chen Xuechang

997
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,680
Have you reported it? 

998
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,480
Report

999
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
Because running a school night shift involves

1000
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,680
And the location and funding.

1001
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,720
So we were

1002
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,840
I specifically consulted Chen Xuechang.

1003
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,960
He is particularly enthusiastic.

1004
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,240
Please ask the purser at that time.

1005
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,360
Address of the night shift of the school attendant 

1006
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,240
We've settled down.

1007
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,720
eh

1008
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:32,800


1009
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,320
中富先生

1010
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,920
Finally, it was returned to the civilian education lecture group 

1011
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,280
Set the purpose of two sentences.

1012
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,160
Which two sentences

1013
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,600
Enhance civilian knowledge

1014
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,040
Arouse the consciousness of common people.

1015
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,760
Brother Zhongfu

1016
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
Yeah, I haven't forgotten him yet.

1017
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Patriotism and self-consciousness

1018
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,800
Good!

1019
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,320
Got it, Mr. Zhongfu.

1020
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,520
And Mr Cai's support.

1021
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,600
This will be easy to handle.

1022
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,600
I suggest it

1023
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,600
Let's find some more people.

1024
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,720
Have a good study.

1025
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,720
This admissions brochure and articles of association.

1026
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,280
Then as soon as possible

1027
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Published in the Peking University Journal.

1028
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,520
Civilian education lecture group

1029
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,960
Is the subject student.

1030
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,640
But not just limited to 

1031
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,840
Students of Peking University

1032
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,480
Can be an organization of the Student Salvation Association.

1033
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,120
such

1034
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,400
Its appeal

1035
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,520
It will be bigger.

1036
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,440
寿昌先生

1037
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,720
That said.

1038
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,920
I can also sign up.

1039
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,560
Of course

1040
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,920
Of course you can sign up. 

1041
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,000
So we're now

1042
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,280
Go and study it.

1043
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:29,760
good

1044
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:30,720
go

1045
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,440
Comrade Liu Mei

1046
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,560
Tell me about the newspaper situation.

1047
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,440
good

1048
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,080
The editor-in-chief of Morning News is a warm-hearted man.

1049
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,440
He introduced me.

1050
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
Reporter of "Learning from the Sea" 

1051
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,080
The reporter.

1052
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,720
I am particularly interested in our work-study mutual aid society.

1053
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,560
Said to make one for us.

1054
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,080
Free series of reports

1055
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,600
I listen to it for free.

1056
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,200
I can talk to him hard.

1057
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,640
We talked for a long time

1058
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,440
I think it was a good talk.

1059
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
He said he would come this afternoon.

1060
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,240
Give us an interview.

1061
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,520
I just want to ask everyone

1062
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
Are you happy or not?

1063
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,120
If everyone says yes, I'll send him over.

1064
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,240
This is a good thing.

1065
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,040
sure

1066
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,760
I think it's negotiable.

1067
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,400
Do you agree?

1068
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
agree

1069
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,040
It also agreed.

1070
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,080
It also agreed.

1071
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,880
pass

1072
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,240
Yes, yes, yes.

1073
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,160
pass

1074
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,240
I'm not going. I'm not going.

1075
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,440
How old am I?

1076
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,520
What kind of night school am I going to? I'm not going

1077
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,240
Uncle Li

1078
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,520
I'm not going. I'm not going.

1079
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:25,920
Uncle Li

1080
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,480
I'm not going.

1081
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,520
Live and learn.

1082
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,960
I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm not going.

1083
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,000
Uncle Li

1084
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,480
Why are you holding me?

1085
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,680
What are you doing?

1086
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,480
Let me tell you something.

1087
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,880
Uncle Li, I want to say this to you. 

1088
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,960
I have already gone to Peking University.

1089
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,200
I found that your body is better than mine.

1090
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,640
But your health alone doesn't work. 

1091
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,560
Say the words you know now.

1092
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,240
It's not enough for you.

1093
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,680
It's embarrassing to say it.

1094
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,120
We open this evening school.

1095
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Teach reading and reading.

1096
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,480
It's free.

1097
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,840
Many good things.

1098
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,880
It's free, really.

1099
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,840
It's free.

1100
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,920
All the best professors, the best sir.

1101
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,400
Where can you find this lantern?

1102
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,920
Can my son learn?

1103
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,040
Your son

1104
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,160
Uncle, that's right.

1105
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,800
Our night school

1106
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
Now we only recruit our own workers.

1107
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,240
Don't accept family members

1108
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,200
Then forget it.

1109
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,240
Then I won't study. I won't study.

1110
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
Uncle Li, uncle Li, uncle Li

1111
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,760
Nengneng

1112
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,640
can I...?

1113
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,600
Stop running, stop running.

1114
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,080
can

1115
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,640
I don't run, I don't run.

1116
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,600
Can you say

1117
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,600
The more people who want to read, the better.

1118
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,840
I am in charge of this matter.

1119
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,680
The day after tomorrow, you and your son

1120
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
Let's attend the first class of our evening school.

1121
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,240
Do you like it?

1122
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,080
Okay, okay, that's what you said

1123
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
It's free. It's free.

1124
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,760
No money, no money.

1125
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,720
Okay, okay, okay.

1126
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,240
Then I'll go home and tell my son

1127
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,320
Let him study the day after tomorrow. Come on

1128
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,040
good

1129
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,400
Well, I'll go first.

1130
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,040
Okay, go.

1131
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,680
Tell my son to go home.

1132
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,640
I wrote it down for you.

1133
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,680
good

1134
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,400
come on

1135
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,600
The child is still coming.

1136
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,800
［said when making an appointment］ (let's) not leave without seeing each other/Be There or Be Square 

1137
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,320
Uncle Wang

1138
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
Uncle Wang, uncle Wang

1139
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,120
Our evening classes will start the day after tomorrow.

1140
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,480
You must remember to come then.

1141
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,080
Let's settle the matter. 

1142
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,680
Why is that settled?

1143
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,520
I don't have the free time.

1144
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,120
Uncle Wang

1145
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Don't run!

1146
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,000
What's wrong with reading?

1147
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,760
evening school

1148
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,640
Yes

1149
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,920
Do you want to go? 

1150
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,200
Don't ask yet.

1151
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,240
Do you want to go? 

1152
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,000
We want to ask you first.

1153
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,600
Are you kidding us?

1154
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,520
not kidding

1155
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,960
Our night school

1156
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,920
Is specialized.

1157
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
It's for our industrial development.

1158
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,480
As long as you want to participate

1159
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,920
I'll fill out the form for you.

1160
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,280
I want to ask you something.

1161
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,880
People like me 

1162
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,320
Can you also go to school?

1163
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,200
Let's!

1164
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,560
Is the greatest laborer.

1165
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,320
Is the most qualified to learn.

1166
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,440
Then I go to

1167
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,240
I will go too.

1168
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,160
good

1169
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
I'll register you right away.

1170
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:55,920
good

1171
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,880
Do these masters want to go?

1172
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm old.

1173
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,960
I won't go.

1174
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,880
Ah, I'm so stupid

1175
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,280
I'm so stupid.

1176
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,320
Afraid of not learning

1177
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,600
I don't know a word.

1178
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,880
Go too.

1179
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,840
Self-delay

1180
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,160
paint

1181
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,760
good

1182
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,600
Because we can't read.

1183
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,760
I need to learn more.

1184
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,760
Look

1185
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,360
We work as laborers in Peking University.

1186
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,640
What is the most inconvenient thing?

1187
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,920
A little higher.

1188
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,000
Ah, wait a minute

1189
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,640
Come to superfine product.

1190
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,200
I'll do it. I'll do it

1191
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,080
I come

1192
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,720
thank you

1193
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,680
Laishifu

1194
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,440
Thank you, thank you

1195
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,160
thank you

1196
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,600
I'll keep talking.

1197
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,960
Master

1198
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,680
Look

1199
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,600
We work as laborers in Peking University.

1200
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,640
The most inconvenient

1201
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,920
Is to speak.

1202
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,120
Can speak but can't write.

1203
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
Someone else wrote it.

1204
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,440
We don't know either.

1205
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,160
This account

1206
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,200
Sometimes it counts.

1207
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,160
I just can't remember.

1208
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,760
As you usually say.

1209
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,920
It is inconvenient to do anything.

1210
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,920
You said that.

1211
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,120
It's on my mind.

1212
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,240
Look, I'm carrying

1213
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
These workmates do work.

1214
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,960
Feed

1215
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,840
Divide the wages

1216
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,720
This will do.

1217
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,760
I can figure it out.

1218
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,200
But I can't write.

1219
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,400
Hurry me up!

1220
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,840
I live in that house.

1221
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
All the walls are painted with bars. 

1222
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,760
There are too many bars drawn here.

1223
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,280
You don't remember it yourself.

1224
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,120
I don't remember your salary, and I didn't owe you. 

1225
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,080
it doesn't matter

1226
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,280
Not anymore.

1227
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,320
Let's Peking University!

1228
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,840
Working specifically for us.

1229
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,800
Started a night school. 

1230
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,920
And?

1231
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,040
All of them are invited by our school.

1232
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,160
The most famous teacher 

1233
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,080
Teach us to read.

1234
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,600
And write letters and settle accounts.

1235
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,640
Teach it!

1236
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
Is our most useful knowledge at ordinary times.

1237
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,080
The key is

1238
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,520
There is no charge for going to school.

1239
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,760
Textbooks are also free.

1240
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,880
We are a night school.

1241
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
It won't delay our work during the day.

1242
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,480
What a good thing this is!

1243
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,240
Listen to what you mean

1244
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,920
You mean to say 

1245
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,960
Is Peking University.

1246
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,480
For us poor people.

1247
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
Do righteous studies.

1248
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,760
It's not just righteousness.

1249
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,880
Is to respect you.

1250
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,320
right to education

1251
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,480
What is right?

1252
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,400
I'm confused when you say this again.

1253
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,320
That is, Peking University runs an evening school.

1254
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,080
Specially for our workers

1255
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,200
Knowledge-intensive

1256
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,880
We have gained knowledge.

1257
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,680
With culture

1258
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,880
It is convenient for us to do our work. 

1259
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,680
You?

1260
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,200
You can also go home and teach your grandchildren.

1261
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,560
for oneself

1262
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,160
For families and schools.

1263
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,040
All help.

1264
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,080
Is it a good thing?

1265
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,040
Master, don't worry.

1266
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,800
If there is any cost

1267
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,440
You guys!

1268
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,640
Come to me.

1269
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,240
毛泽东

1270
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,680
What I just said.

1271
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,880
Do you understand

1272
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,760
Listen to understand

1273
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,640
What about us?

1274
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,080
Just go to school with peace of mind

1275
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
In case someone asks us for money.

1276
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Let's find Mao Zedong.

1277
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,040
Look for me. Look for me.

1278
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,600
nicely

1279
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,040
The people in our gardening room

1280
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,480
All go to school.
