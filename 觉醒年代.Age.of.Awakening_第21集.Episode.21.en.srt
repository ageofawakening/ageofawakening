[Episode Twenty-one]

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,880
President Xu Shichang has asked me to tell you all

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
that the feelings and wishes of the government of the Republic of China and the Qingdao citizens

5
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:13,988
[Wang Daxie, styled Botang, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Republic of China]

are the same.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,480
The government delegation of the Republic of China

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,320
attending the Paris Peace Conference

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
has successfully arrived in Paris.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,040
They will discuss and solve

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,880
the relations and interests between China and Germany after the war

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,760
with the victorious countries,

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,120
to safeguard China's sovereignty and the interests of the people.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,640
The ambassadors to the United States, Britain, France and Italy,

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,000
asked me to send greetings to you all

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,240
when they heard about this.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,280
They will uphold the principle of fairness and justice,

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,520
safeguard China's sovereignty,

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,640
guarantee the territorial integrity of big and small countries

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,240
and their political independence.

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
So we have reason to believe

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
that in the near future,

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,040
the Shandong Peninsula will be completely returned to China.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
Hurrah!

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,440
Because

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,680
we are, after all,

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,760
victorious in this world war.

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,760
We have a chance to claim the fruits of victory.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,640
Long live China! Long live China!

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,840
Long live China! Long live China! Long live China!

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,600
On the verge of success,

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
the fact that

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu had made such a mess,

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,880
is really exploitative and pervasive.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
Didn't the National Assembly already accept

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,200
Cai Yuanpei's proposal before?

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,880
Why did you retract it?

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
It wasn't the petition group that caused it.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Because the war in Europe was won,

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,440
the patriotic enthusiasm of Chinese people is unprecedentedly high.

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,120
Now there's another Qingdao petition group

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,480
that immediately won the support of the people.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
And the Northern and Southern governments being at odds

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
has always been complained of by the people.

45
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,240
It's very difficult to get a Paris Peace Conference,

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,680
which can divert your attention.

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
At this juncture,

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
naturally, there will be no more trouble.

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
This is not a retraction.

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,440
These people are really cunning.

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,560
Uncle, what should we do next?

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,320
You're at Peking University every day,

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
and you didn't notice

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,520
what their new trends are?

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,040
There's one thing.

go to that house.

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,040
Uncle, Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu have taken the lead recently

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,960
to set up a Work-Study Mutual Aid Society

60
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
that's said to experiment with anarchism

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,080
and communism,

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
and also open to the community

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
to enlist many people

64
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,600
who come from afar.

65

Keep an eye on this mutual aid society.

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
Do you think there are articles to write here?

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
This kind of corrupt and filthy society

71
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
has the responsibility and obligation

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,800
to expose its true face to the public.

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
Yes, I understand.

74
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
Come and sit, one and all!

I'm in a really good mood today.

76

You say one thing and I say another, helping each other is the truth.

77

are all members of a big family.

Everyone in the society calls each other comrades.

92
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,760
Do you have any objection?

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,560
Agreed.

I'm a student at Zhejiang First Provincial Normal School.

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
The reason why I came to Beijing

109
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
to join our Work-Study Mutual Aid Society

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,400
is because I yearn for,

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
I yearn for a kind of anarchy

112
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
with no power, no law,

no religion, no marriage,

an ideal life without family.

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
And I think our Work-Study Mutual Aid Society

116
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,480
is this kind of life.

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
I understand the so-called work-study mutual aid

118
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
is labor

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
and hard work,

120
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,880
and mutual aid is evolution.

It's 523 yuan in total.

188
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,200
Of this amount,

189
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,600
350 yuan is donated by the community.

190
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
Membership fees and donations by members

191
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
totals 173 yuan.

192
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Regarding working, let me explain it first.

193
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,680
I, Qiaonian, and Guo

194
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,600
will be doing distribution for "New Youth".

195
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,440
Bai Lan will work as a tutor in the embassy district.

196
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,560
Keep doing all this.

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
It's just that revenue must be collectively owned.

198
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
Now, we will implement three businesses.

199
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,400
First, a work-study canteen that needs six people.

200
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,640
Second, four people to wash clothes.

201
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
Third, three people to show movies.

202
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,840
Let's discuss

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
these three businesses.

204
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
No need to discuss.

205
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,240
I'll run the canteen.

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,840
Xingang. Yannian.

207
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
Bai Lan. Liu Mei.

208
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
If you guys have nothing to do at times,

209
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,920
just come and assist me.

210
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,960
OK. No problem.

211
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
No problem. I'll tell you what,

212
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
Qingdao will be back soon.

213
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm in a good mood these past two days.

214
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
Don't say that I'll "assist" you,

215
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,640
it sounds like I'd be a servant.

216
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
Then I'll do the laundry.

217
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,600
Count me in!

218
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,720
Count me in too.

219
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
Count me in too.

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,480
Good!

221
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,080
I'm good for nothing.

222
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,440
I'll play the movies.

223
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
What do you mean you're good for nothing? That's easy.

224
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
You're a good-for-nothing.

225
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,440
Joined the mutual aid society.

226
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,840
Showing movies is too hard for you.

227
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,360
You really are a good-for-nothing.

228
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Great!

229
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,880
Well said!

230
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,840
Awesome!

231
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,880
Good point!

232
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
Ok, everyone is sleeping well.

233
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,880
Stop sleeping!

234
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,680
Stop sleeping!

235
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:03,920
Who is it?

236
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,640
Who are you?

237
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,520
Yu Xiusong!

238
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,050
Everyone, get up! You know what time it is?

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
I said what are you yelling about in the middle of the night?

240
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,280
Are you sleepwalking?

241
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,320
Middle of the night?

242
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,160
Still asleep, still asleep!

243
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,040
What are you doing?

244
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,960
Get up! Stop sleeping!

245
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you calling for in the middle of the night?

246
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Middle of the night? Do you know what time it is?

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,760
Do you know what day it is today?

248
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,560
What day?

249
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,680
Qiaonian, don't drag my blanket.

250
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Today is the first day of the work-study canteen.

251
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
We buy rice at 6:30.

252
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
It's 6:00 now!

253
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
I almost missed something big.

254
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,400
Qiaonian! Wake up, wake up!

255
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
What's up? The chicken hasn't crowed yet.

256
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
What noise when it's dawn?

257
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,680
Wash yourself!

258
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,560
Get up quickly!

259
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
Where are you going?

260
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,760
I waited all night for their crowing.

261
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,280
I'll deal with them.

262
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,520
Guo, go and call the girls.

263
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
The girls?

264
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,160
The girls got up early to help.

265
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,160
You boys are worse than the girls.

266
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
Fools!

267
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,720
Come, come! Time to eat!

268
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,480
Come here.

269
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,520
Eat!

270
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
I almost got up late

271
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
because of you not crowing!

272
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,280
You didn't crow when you should've crowed!

273
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,880
Don't you know what your job is?

274
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,080
Comrades who got up late.

275
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
You guys can go back to sleep again.

276
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
I'll tell the sun

277
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
to come back out later.

278
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,520
We comrades who got up late

279
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,760
bow to the women who got up early.

280
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,520
No, don't, you don't have to.

281
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,120
Late risers,

282
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
why don't you go back to sleep?

283
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,920
We don't need you here.

284
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,480
Come on!

285
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:33,991
I feel ashamed.

286
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,840
Late risers,

287
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,680
look at how beautifully the yard

288
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
and stove are cleaned

289
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,720
by the women who got up early

290
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
and Comrade Hai Wei who didn't sleep.

291
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,120
All thanks to our Shandong chef.

292
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
Late risers, go back to sleep.

293
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,560
Women who get up early don't feel tired when they work.

294
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,960
Comrade Yannian, listen carefully.

295
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,120
The frugal canteen opens today.

296
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,160
What was it again?

297
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
The best in China!

298
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,800
Yes, yes, yes!

299
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,680
Hurry up!

300
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,760
Come on!

301
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,240
Open for business!

302
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,120
Open up! Let's go!

303
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,840
Yes, yes, yes!

304
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,440
Good!

305
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,840
Is that OK?

306
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,440
Looks good!

307
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,200
Comrades,

308
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,840
the frugal canteen is our home.

309
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
Let's go, comrades!

310
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,640
Let's go!

311
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,520
Open up!

312
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,240
Let's work!

313
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,280
Let's go to work!

314
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
"Time flows like water,"

315
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
"Soon we shall depart from school,"

316
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,320
"We will ponder for a while"

317
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
"to understand today's homework,"

318
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,600
"Have we ever gone against our teacher?"

319
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,000
"Parents want children to come home,"

320
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
"We should not wander on the road"

321
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,840
"of leading the country's future and the world"

322
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,440
"which depends on our generation,"

323
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,920
"Everybody, let's work hard!"

324
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,160
"See you again tomorrow, classmates."

325
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,224
Let's go, everyone!

326
00:12:15,224 --> 00:12:17,040
Let's go!

327
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,400
Oil cakes! Steamed buns!

328
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Freshly baked oil cakes!

329
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Come and try it!

330
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
Yes, please try the oil cakes

331
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,240
and steamed buns!

332
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,360
Cheap and good quality.

333
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
Keep yelling, keep yelling.

334
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,800
We're selling breakfast here.

335
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,760
Morning, sir.

336
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,520
Come on, come on, students!

337
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,120
Our first order for today!

338
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,160
Welcome.

339
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:36,960
Hello, sir.

340
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,840
Hello, Mr. Shizhi.

341
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,800
Good morning, everyone.

342
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,240
Sir,

343
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
it's still hot just after coming out of the pot.

344
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Please have one.

345
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
Mr. Shizhi, have some oil cakes and steamed buns.

346
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
It's cheap here.

347
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,445
Yes, try it.

348
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:46,720
Try it.

349
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:51,250
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

350
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,480
Okay, I'll have a taste.

351
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,840
Delicious!

352
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,160
Isn't it?

353
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,560
How is it?

354
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,840
Tastes good!

355
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,400
Isn't it?

356
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,760
Try some more.

357
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,560
Try them all. Try them all.

358
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,640
I think we need to promote

359
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
our frugal canteen.

360
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,240
Find a newspaper to sponsor advertising.

361
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Take a picture of the four words

362
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
and the couplet at the entrance and put it up.

363
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,440
That's your signature!

364
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
Right.

365
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,640
The four words on our plaque were written by Mr. Cai.

366
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,400
This couplet on both sides

367
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,520
was written by Mr. Lu Xun.

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,240
You see?

369
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,200
You didn't make good use

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,640
of such a good resource.

371
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,840
Isn't it a pity?

372
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,280
Good idea, sir.

373
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,040
Our student union can also help.

374
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll have to trouble you then.

375
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,520
Everybody make good use of this resource.

376
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
Do you have steamed buns and oil cakes?

377
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,760
We do!

378
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,520
Mr. Shouchang!

379
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,800
Mr. Shouchang!

380
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,600
Students,

381
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:37,491
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

382
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,520
your second order is here!

383
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Shizhi, you also come to buy breakfast.

384
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm not here to buy breakfast.

385
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
I am their volunteer publicist.

386
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,520
Mr. Shouchang,

387
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
today is the first day of opening

388
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,840
of our frugal canteen.

389
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,280
How can you support us?

390
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm here to pay tribute.

391
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,440
This place is really nice.

392
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
Good, good.

393
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,560
Yannian,

394
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,240
an oil cake and a bowl of porridge.

395
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,280
Yes, sir, please sit down.

396
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,680
Okay.

397
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
An oil cake and a bowl of porridge!

398
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,280
Okay!

399
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,200
An oil cake and a bowl of porridge are not enough.

400
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
Mr. Shouchang is so big,

401
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
he needs to have three oil cakes and three bowls of porridge.

402
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
I can't eat so much.

403
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
How many oil cakes did you eat?

404
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,680
I have family rules.

405
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,200
I can't eat breakfast outside.

406
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
Do you have any money?

407
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,920
Yannian,

408
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,280
three oil cakes and three bowls of porridge.

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400
I and Mr. Shizhi will eat here.

410
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,120
Mr. Shouchang.

411
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,080
Yannian!

412
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
No, family rules are family rules.

413
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,640
I can't break them.

414
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,360
You know what?

415
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
I'll tell your aunt Dongxiu tomorrow morning

416
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,560
to stop making breakfast.

417
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,960
Let's have breakfast together at the frugal canteen.

418
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,360
How about that?

419
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,880
Alright!

420
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,320
Okay!

421
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm leaving, brother Shouchang.

422
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,080
Students, work hard!

423
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,040
See you later.

424
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,760
Goodbye, sir.

425
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,400
Sir, walk slowly.

426
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,160
Guo,

427
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm leaving, too.

428
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
I will come again tomorrow.

429
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,640
I can give you the bill.

430
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,280
I'll pay later!

431
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,160
Come tomorrow.

432
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,880
See you tomorrow!

433
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Come tomorrow.

434
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,520
The little fatty can eat quite well,

435
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,320
that fatty.

436
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,400
Yannian,

437
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,760
come here.

438
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
Here is ten yuan for you.

439
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,720
I will come here for breakfast every day in the future.

440
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,600
This is inappropriate, sir.

441
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,360
All your money goes to the poor.

442
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Don't listen to them.

443
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,080
Mr. Cai actually deducts thirty dollars a month

444
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
and sends it directly to my wife.

445
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
So I have no worries here.

446
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,880
You also don't have any ideas.

447
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,800
Thank you, sir.

448
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,720
It's really good.

449
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,760
Comrades!

450
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,080
The first official order,

451
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,280
ten yuan!

452
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,840
Business is booming!

453
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,280
Thank you, sir.

454
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,840
You say you're such a big man.

455
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,760
What are you angry with the children about?

456
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,200
I'm ashamed of you.

457
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,400
You can't talk nonsense.

458
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm not angry with him.

459
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,240
You're not angry with them.

460
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
Why don't you let me go to the frugal canteen to buy breakfast?

461
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,280
Dad,

462
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
I also want to eat breakfast cooked by Yannian.

463
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,160
I want to eat, too.

464
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,514
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

465
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,840
Isn't there food at home?

466
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,360
Why do you want to buy it?

467
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,840
There is no place to spend money.

468
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,960
You said,

469
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
the frugal canteen opened on the first day today,

470
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,400
and I shouldn't have given them a boost.

471
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,480
You went today, will you go tomorrow?

472
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
Since it is an experiment, it needs objective facts.

473
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
The results are valuable.

474
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,800
Let them rely on themselves.

475
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,080
All right, let's eat.

476
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,440
Why are you going?

477
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,560
I filled all the porridge for you.

478
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,680
I'm full.

479
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm going to have a look around

480
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,560
and digest the food.

481
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,040
Stop wiping.

482
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,200
This table is polished like a mirror.

483
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,560
There's not one guest here. Why are you cleaning it?

484
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,240
What's going on?

485
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
You can't sell a single oil cake.

486
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,160
Stop frying.

487
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,360
What's the use of frying so much?

488
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,120
There aren't any guests, it's a waste to fry.

489
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,760
Not how your words sound to my ears.

490
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,960
What is waste?

491
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,400
This cake won't sell.

492
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,320
There is something wrong with your publicity.

493
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,360
We've been dragging

494
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,240
people here all morning.

495
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,280
What are you talking about?

496
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,160
You made the oil cake. There is something wrong with it.

497
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,040
I'm telling you, you have a skills problem.

498
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,320
I have a skills problem?

499
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:28,720
Yeah!

500
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
Mr. Hu Shi said my cake was delicious.

501
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
Then I don't think your cake is delicious.

502
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,120
Why don't you go out and get people?

503
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
A group of people have been sitting there all morning.

504
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,160
Guo was sleeping.

505
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,800
Why don't you go?

506
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,760
Okay, okay!

507
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,360
This is our first day of opening,

508
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
it's normal to have concerns.

509
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
Take your time, this thing can not be rushed.

510
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
Why do you have concerns?

511
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,720
Why don't you go?

512
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,240
Okay, okay, I won't argue with you all.

513
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,280
Do what you want.

514
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,080
What kind of attitude is that?

515
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,600
It's urgent.

516
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,400
Everyone.

517
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,560
Business is booming?

518
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,120
Hello, Mr. Zhongfu.

519
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,840
Hello, Mr. Zhongfu.

520
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,040
Please sit down, sir.

521
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,000
Please, please.

522
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,800
Please sit down, sir.

523
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
Make room for sir. Go, go, go.

524
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,200
Come here.

525
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Sit down, sir.

526
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
Mr. Zhongfu,

527
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,920
you haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

528
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,000
No, no, no.

529
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,720
What can I get here?

530
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
What do you have here?

531
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,160
How many do we have here?

532
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,800
Don't serve him.

533
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,720
Why don't you serve him?

534
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,040
Yannian!

535
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,480
We don't need his sympathy.

536
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,760
Chen Yannian.

537
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,360
This is our business.

538
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,120
It's not up to you alone.

539
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,760
Sir, you're kidding.

540
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,880
Let me introduce to you what we have.

541
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,680
We have porridge, steamed buns, oil cakes

542
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,480
and soy milk.

543
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,280
And the soy milk

544
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,640
was freshly ground by me this morning.

545
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,520
Then I'll have a bowl of soy milk

546
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
and an oil cake.

547
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,760
Got it!

548
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,640
One is not enough.

549
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,200
Sir, Mr. Dazhao was here this morning.

550
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
He ordered three oil cakes

551
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,840
and three bowls of soy milk.

552
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,960
He eats so much!

553
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,520
Right.

554
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,560
Then give me two oil cakes

555
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
and one bowl of soy milk.

556
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,160
Got it!

557
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,800
Go, go!

558
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,000
Okay, okay, I'll go. I'll go

559
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,360
Please wait a moment, sir.

560
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,320
This is a fresh cake

561
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,000
Here is one cake, fresh out of the pan.

562
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,040
Not bad.

563
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
Try the freshly ground soy milk.

564
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,800
Nice.

565
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,240
Good.

566
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
You guys get busy.

567
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,400
Okay.

568
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,440
Enjoy your meal, sir.

569
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Please enjoy your meal, sir.

570
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,840
You guys are looking at me eating.

571
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,160
Comrades,

572
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,800
although it is a small business,

573
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,880
our frugal canteen has just opened its first day today.

574
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
But,

575
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
first, we don't accept sympathy from others.

576
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,920
second, we do not forgive bills.

577
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,160
That Fu Sinian got up in the morning

578
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
and I just cancelled his bill.

579
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,320
Fu Sinian is a student.

580
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
From now on, everyone except students

581
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,760
cannot cancel the bill.

582
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,680
Guo.

583
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,360
You keep an eye on it.

584
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,960
If someone doesn't pay for the meal today,

585
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,080
don't let them out of this door.

586
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
We must resolutely resist freeloading.

587
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,280
Who are you talking about?

588
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,320
What freeloading?

589
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,440
What insinuating remarks.

590
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
Why do you eat and eat, and yet are anxious?

591
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,120
You don't have any money, do you?

592
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,640
I- I- I-

593
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,240
I left in a hurry. I forgot.

594
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,560
That won't do.

595
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
What should I do if you don't have any money?

596
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,240
What can I do?

597
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,200
I- I- I- I'll go back.

598
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm sure I'll give you the money then.

599
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,240
How can I trust you?

600
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,120
If you go out and run away,

601
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,320
then where can I find you?

602
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,760
I- I- I- Where would I go?

603
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
I don't know.

604
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,880
Look, have you eaten the oil cake?

605
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,600
Yeah.

606
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,400
Have you drunk soybean milk?

607
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,440
Just a sip.

608
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,640
Then a sip is a drink.

609
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,760
Isn't that freeloading?

610
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,800
What freeloading?

611
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,840
Didn't I tell you?

612
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
I'll give you the money when I come back.

613
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,040
We absolutely cannot cancel the bill.

614
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,400
I've heard that.

615
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
Didn't Fu Sinian cancel the bill, too?

616
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
There's a difference between you and Fu Sinian.

617
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,640
How about you?

618
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
How much do you earn a month?

619
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,560
What should I do then?

620
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,840
I just forgot my money.

621
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,360
I forgot my money. Why?

622
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,720
Should I give you all my clothes?

623
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,520
No, no, no.

624
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,640
We can't take your clothes.

625
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,000
How about this?

626
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,520
We are an anarchist

627
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
communist mutual aid society

628
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,880
that follows the principle of mutual assistance.

629
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,160
Those who do not work, do not eat.

630
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,800
Go wash the dishes to settle the bill.

631
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,760
Wash the dishes?

632
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,200
That doesn't suit you?

633
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,920
Chopping firewood, washing clothes, feeding chickens,

634
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,680
milking goats, grinding soybeans,

635
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,280
and gluing envelopes.

636
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,720
Anything. You choose.

637
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Okay, I'll wash the dishes.

638
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,920
Mr. Zhongfu, how can you wash the dishes?

639
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
No, no, no.

640
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,240
I will follow your rules.

641
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,840
A man without money is no man at all.

642
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,560
I'll wash the dishes.

643
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
Please eat first, then wash after eating.

644
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
I'll wash it before eating it.

645
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,880
Otherwise, I can't eat steadily.

646
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Can you beat me? This

647
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,920
Where are your bowls?

648
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,680
I'm really sorry.

649
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
You haven't finished your meal yet.

650
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,440
You have to wash your own dishes after eating.

651
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,040
No, Yannian.

652
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Chen Yannian

653
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,480
You're trying to squeeze your old man, aren't you?

654
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,920
Who pushed you?

655
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,240
Hello, madame.

656
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,680
You also

657
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,120
asked your dad to wash your dishes.

658
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,520
He hasn't smashed all your bowls yet.

659
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
I knew you didn't have any money.

660
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,560
Yannian, here.

661
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,480
This is the money your father gives you.

662
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
Comrades, the third order!

663
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,400
Thank you, guests.

664
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,080
Hold on to this.

665
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
Thank you, Mr. Zhongfu.

666
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
Didn't you have breakfast this morning?

667
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,160
Not full?

668
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
This morning,

669
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,440
I was the one who wanted to give you a boost first.

670
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,360
As a result, your father refused

671
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
to let me come anyway.

672
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,520
As a result, I came here first.

673
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,320
The point is, he didn't bring any money.

674
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,040
Liu Mei, Bai Lan.

675
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm here for the first time today.

676
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,840
Show me around.

677
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,480
Ok.

678
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,600
This is our chicken and duck.

679
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,800
This is common property.

680
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,840
That's the laundry room.

681
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,840
Good, good, good.

682
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,120
You let go!

683
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
You let go!

684
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,680
You let go!

685
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,480
I won't let go!

686
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,280
If you join a mutual aid society,

687
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,720
you must have all communist consciousness.

688
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
This is my personal property. Why should I be communist?

689
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,960
You let go!

690
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,920
Will you let go?!

691
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,800
I won't let go!

692
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,680
Don't you let me shout?

693
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,480
Shout, then!

694
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,720
Yu Xiusong.

695
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,760
What are you doing? Let him go.

696
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,960
Comrade Chen Yannian, you're just in time.

697
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,320
You reason this out.

698
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
I was so excited to join a mutual aid society

699
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,160
to realize communism that I stayed up all night.

700
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,560
Get down.

701
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
I put all my clothes away.

702
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,240
Get down!

703
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
Now that we're communist,

704
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,040
there can be no more private property.

705
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,200
I laid out all the clothes I brought.

706
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,400
I think Comrade Yu is a rich boy.

707
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,800
I came to encourage him to put out his clothes.

708
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,240
There are three new pants here.

709
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,600
Guess what?

710
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
He refused.

711
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,480
How unreasonable are you?

712
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,080
Everyone, what are your thoughts on this?

713
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
She came to open my suitcase early in the morning

714
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,560
and asked me to hand in my clothes.

715
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,920
This suitcase is full of my personal belongings

716
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,960
and school equipment.

717
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
Yes, there are pants in it.

718
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
Those are men's pants. You can't even wear them!

719
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,160
You're so unreasonable!

720
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,760
Who said I was going to wear your pants?

721
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,760
I can't wear your pants.

722
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,520
But other comrades can wear it.

723
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,680
What's wrong with you?

724
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,120
You have three new pants here.

725
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,600
Can't you share with those whose pants are worn out?

726
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,440
Or to comrades with only one pair of pants?

727
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,680
You are still elected by the Social Committee.

728
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,960
Selfish!

729
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
I am selfish?

730
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
You're a pants person, aren't you?

731
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
You say "pants" left and "pants" right.

732
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
Who says communism must hand in pants?

733
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
Is there such a clause in the constitution of our Work-Study Mutual Aid Society?

734
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,520
All right, stop arguing.

735
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,440
Do you want to share the members' clothes?

736
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,120
There are no clear rules yet.

737
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
You have this idea?

738
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
It can be submitted to the general assembly for voting.

739
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,480
Until then, keep it as it is.

740
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,520
Time to eat.

741
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,520
Chairman.

742
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,960
Minister Chen has arrived.

743
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,080
Master Bo.

744
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,240
What important documents?

745
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,080
Minister Chen has to deliver it himself.

746
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:08,727
[Chen Lu, styled Renxian, Acting Foreign Minister]

747
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
See for yourself.

748
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,960
What's going on here?

749
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
It's been rejected, and returned unchanged.

750
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,160
What's the matter?

751
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,520
Last night, Japan's envoy to China, Xiao Yun, met with me

752
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,120
and the envoys of the United States, Britain, Italy and France

753
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,640
and claimed that the core of the Shandong Peninsula issue

754
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,480
was not the interests of China and Germany,

755
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,400
but the interests of Japan and Germany.

756
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,200
We asked that at the Paris Peace Conference...

757
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,040
Don't make a big deal out of it.

758
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,200
Early this morning,

759
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,880
President Xu brought Wu Bingxiang and me together

760
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
and asked me

761
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,120
to return this petition

762
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,560
and the people's statement to you

763
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,040
He asked Wu Bingxiang to take measures.

764
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,400
No more slogans and leaflets appeared on the streets of Beijing.

765
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,840
Then the embassies of the United States, Britain, France and Italy

766
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,120
also returned all the invitation letters from Qingdao.

767
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,720
Outrageous.

768
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Can spilled water be recovered?

769
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,760
What does Xu Shichang want?

770
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,760
He's playing with me like a monkey.

771
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,120
Don't you want Qingdao?

772
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,040
President Xu also asked me to tell you

773
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,120
that he still wants Qingdao,

774
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
we should pay attention to strategy.

775
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,120
Don't boil the Japanese.

776
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,120
If you can't bear it, you will make great plans.

777
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
He knows how to endure.

778
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,560
Be patient when you are defeated.

779
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,080
If you win, you have to endure it.

780
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,480
I think this country is possessed.

781
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,360
Weak countries have no diplomacy. This is an iron law.

782
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,480
Then what is justice?

783
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,160
What about the embassies of the four countries?

784
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,040
Wilson's words don't count either?

785
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
When the U.S. Embassy returned the letter,

786
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
it emphasized

787
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,040
that the U.S. attitude towards China

788
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,720
has always been consistent.

789
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,600
I don't think so.

790
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,520
This is a signal

791
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,680
that the Paris Peace Conference is in trouble.

792
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,560
Master Bo, it already is.

793
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,160
What happened?

794
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,680
When the delegation received

795
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,120
the ranking of domestic personnel,

796
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,400
it was already in an uproar.

797
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,040
Wang Zhengting cursed President Xu.

798
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,640
for discriminating against the Southern government.

799
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,400
Shi Zhaoji took the load off his shoulders.

800
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,720
Lu Zhengxiang simply went to Switzerland.

801
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
Now it's all up to Gu Weijun.

802
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,240
This is to be expected.

803
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,920
I have sent telegrams to Lu Zhengxiang

804
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,280
and Gu Weijun respectively,

805
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,280
and Gu Weijun sends back replies daily.

806
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,560
When it's critical, Lu Zhengxiang must come out.

807
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,920
It's admirable that the chairman

808
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,280
has won a great victory.

809
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,000
There is still trouble at home.

810
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,200
Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, Lu Zongxing.

811
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,400
These people are despicable.

812
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,320
The pro-Japanese faction can't be underestimated.

813
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,280
After all is said,

814
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
all still depend on the foreigners.

815
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,480
Truly a shame!

816
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,440
Please.

817
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,720
This is recommended by Mr. Dazhao.

818
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,680
That's right.

819
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,960
Okay, sit down.

820
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,440
Thank you.

821
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,280
The Work-Study Mutual Aid Society

822
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
is a new thing that everyone is very concerned about.

823
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Of course, it's what our newspaper is interested in

824
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,520
and reported before.

825
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,600
Miss Liu, what about the list

826
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,880
you provided this time?

827
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,680
In principle?

828
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,600
It can be classified as social news.

829
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
We have no problem publishing it.

830
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,000
However, the introduction of the canteen,

831
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,800
laundry

832
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
and film screening group you mentioned

833
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,840
is actually in the advertising category.

834
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,200
There is a fee.

835
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
Miss Liu, did you know that?

836
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,280
The Work-Study Mutual Aid Society is full of students.

837
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,920
Work-study is a part-work and part-study programme.

838
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,560
We have no money to advertise.

839
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm here to apply

840
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
and see if your newspaper can sponsor us.

841
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,240
Miss Liu,

842
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,680
it's actually embarrassing for us,

843
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,040
because your sponsorship

844
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,360
is difficult to pass at the board meeting.

845
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,280
I can give you an idea.

846
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,760
Go on.

847
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,920
Not only do you need to advertise,

848
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,520
but you only need to write a press release.

849
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,960
You find a reporter

850
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,480
to unify your canteens,

851
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,560
including laundry

852
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,240
and film screening groups,

853
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,680
do an interview

854
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
and write a press release.

855
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,280
Not only can it be published in newspapers,

856
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,240
but other media will reprint it.

857
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,520
In this case,

858
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,960
not only did it not cost a penny,

859
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,880
but this kind of influence

860
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,800
will also produce great results.

861
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,640
That's good.

862
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,760
Or ask the editor-in-chief

863
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,360
to write a report.

864
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,560
Young lady.

865
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,800
You are still too honest.

866
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,600
Not only do you have to find this reporter yourself,

867
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
it's better to be a columnist.

868
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,680
If you're lucky,

869
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,680
maybe he will even pay you an interview fee.

870
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,360
I don't know your business either.

871
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,480
I don't know where to start

872
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
to find a reporter like this.

873
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
Mr. Xie,

874
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,280
you are half-hearted during this work.

875
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,560
It's against the social rules.

876
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,000
Zhang, you're here.

877
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,280
Here, the manuscript has been delivered to you.

878
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,240
Good.

879
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,360
Here,

880
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,680
Miss Liu, you are so lucky.

881
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,120
Let me introduce to you

882
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,240
this young man.

883
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,560
He's in charge of our column

884
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,680
"Learning from the Sea",

885
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,880
and he is also the special director

886
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,640
of several newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai.

887
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,240
Come on, let's get to know each other.

888
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,720
Hello.

889
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,680
Hello, hello.

890
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,880
By the way, Zhang

891
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,400
Zhang I remember you said before

892
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
you are not very interested in understanding

893
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,280
this Work-Study Mutual Aid Society?

894
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,960
Then help this Miss Liu.

895
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,600
Work-Study Mutual Aid Society is a good subject.

896
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,120
I'm very interested.

897
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

898
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,200
Then let's talk somewhere else.

899
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,720
Isn't it nice here?

900
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,840
How can it be here?

901
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,600
The interview is not a matter of three or two sentences.

902
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,040
There is a cafe next to this.

903
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,920
It's my treat.

904
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,640
Okay.

905
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,440
Let's go, then. Please.

906
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:12,960
We're going, Mr. Xie.

907
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,520
Don't bother.

908
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,400
Thank you, editor-in-chief.

909
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:14,800
Don't mention it.

910
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,280
Thank you.

911
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,800
Students,

912
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,120
the mutual aid frugal canteen has opened.

913
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,000
Come next time.

914
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,840
Tired of school meals?

915
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,440
Students, come here.

916
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,440
Yannian!

917
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,000
Come and find out.

918
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,480
Yannian!

919
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:29,920
Yannian!

920
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,680
Yannian, come!

921
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,600
Let me introduce you to some students from the English department.

922
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
They asked if they could pack food and wash clothes.

923
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,200
and then give them

924
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,400
a monthly discount.

925
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,040
Okay, no problem.

926
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,000
Let's come here to discuss.

927
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,640
Student, who are you looking for to wash clothes?

928
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,840
Wash clothes over there!

929
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,640
Pack up here.

930
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
I'll make arrangements for you again.

931
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,640
Okay, okay.

932
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,080
We have someone from Shandong there.

933
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,880
His cooking is particularly good.

934
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,320
There were only two people interested in this movie ticket for half a day.

935
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,040
What should I do?

936
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
You guys are so stubborn.

937
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,560
Have you ever seen a group of gentlemen

938
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,440
go to the movies?

939
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,960
There are no girls in Peking University.

940
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,560
Who are you selling movie tickets to?

941
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
So you Peking University students don't watch movies?

942
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,120
Let's see.

943
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,880
I went to other schools to accompany my female classmates.

944
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,480
If you really want to sell the tickets,

945
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,560
I'll think of a way for you .

946
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,040
Yi Qunxian!

947
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,000
Coming!

948
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,040
Yi Qunxian!

949
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,160
Come here.

950
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,680
Classmates, come here!

951
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
Let me help you solve this problem right away.

952
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,680
I'd like to introduce a female classmate to you today.

953
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,240
Hello all.

954
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm Xie Wanying from Union Women's College Prep.

955
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:21,881
[Xie Wanying]

956
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,440
Hello.

957
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,240
Hello, hello.

958
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,520
Are there many girls in your school?

959
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,960
We're from a women's university.

960
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,480
A women's university.

961
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,400
Do your school boys watch movies with girls?

962
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,440
Nonsense!

963
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,720
Do you think everyone is like you?

964
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,280
It's very cheap for us to package laundry here.

965
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
We can also have dinner in groups.

966
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,800
Movie tickets must be popular in your school.

967
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,200
People can't hear you clearly.

968
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,120
You say it one by one.

969
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,320
Sir,

970
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,760
we would like to report to you

971
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,400
about the establishment

972
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,840
of a lecture group on civilian education.

973
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,040
Okay, go on.

974
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,560
According to your last suggestion,

975
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,760
we discussed it with several societies

976
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,040
such as "Citizen",

977
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,920
"The Renaissance",

978
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,880
and Marxist Research Society.

979
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:57,920
We've decided

980
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,800
to set up

981
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,080
a school night shift at Peking University first.

982
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,520
That is, night classes for workers,

983
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,960
three nights a week,

984
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,400
to popularize culture to workers,

985
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,120
and explain current affairs.

986
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,560
and then we decided

987
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,760
to formally set up

988
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,960
a civilian education lecture group

989
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,000
on this basis

990
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,440
to recruit companions

991
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,400
from all walks of life.

992
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:14,629
[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

993
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,520
This is our

994
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,800
draft brochure

995
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,760
and recruitment notice.

996
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,880
Have a look.

997
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,440
Alright.

998
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,040
This matter has something to do with Dean Chen.

999
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,680
Have you reported it?

1000
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,480
We have.

1001
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
Because running a school night shift involves

1002
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,680
the location and funding.

1003
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,720
So we

1004
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,840
specifically consulted Dean Chen.

1005
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,960
He was particularly enthusiastic

1006
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,240
and asked the superintendent

1007
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,360
to give us the address

1008
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,240
of the school night shift.

1009
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,320
Mr. Zhongfu.

1010
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,920
concluded his speech with two sentences

1011
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,280
about the purpose of the Civilian Education Lecture Group.

1012
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,160
What two sentences?

1013
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,600
To enhance civilian knowledge,

1014
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,040
and to arouse the consciousness of common people.

1015
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,760
That brother Zhongfu!

1016
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
Yeah, I haven't forgotten his

1017
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Patriotism and Self-consciousness.

1018
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,800
Good!

1019
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,320
With Mr. Zhongfu's

1020
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,520
and Mr. Cai's support,

1021
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,600
this will be easy to handle.

1022
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,600
I suggest

1023
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,600
we find some more people.

1024
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,720
to study this

1025
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,720
this enrollment brochure and articles of association

1026
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,280
and publish them

1027
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
in the Peking University journal as soon as possible.

1028
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,520
The main body of the civilian education lecture group

1029
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,960
is students,

1030
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,640
but it is not limited

1031
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,840
to the students of Peking University.

1032
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,480
It can be used as an organization of the Student Salvation Association.

1033
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,120
This way,

1034
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,400
its appeal

1035
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,520
will be bigger.

1036
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,440
Mr. Shouchang,

1037

with that said,

I can also sign up.

1040
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,560
Of course.

Of course you can sign up.

1042
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,000
So then,

1043
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,280
let's go and study it.

1044
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:29,760
Alright.

1045
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:30,720
Let's go.

1046
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,440
Comrade Liu Mei,

1047
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,560
tell us about the newspaper situation.

1048
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,440
Okay.

1049
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,080
The editor-in-chief of the "Morning Post" is a warm-hearted man.

1050
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,440
He introduced me

1051
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960

The reporter.

1053
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,720
was particularly interested in our Work-Study Mutual Aid Society

1054
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,560
and said to make for us

1055
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,080
a free series of reports.

1056
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,600
When I heard it was free,

1057
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,200
I talked to him as hard as I coumd.

1058
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,640
We talked for a long time.

1059
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,440
I think it was a good talk.

1060
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
He said he would come this afternoon

1061
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,240
and give us an interview.

1062
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,520
I just want to ask everyone

1063
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
if they're happy or not.

1064
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,120
If everyone says yes, I'll send him over.

1065
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,240
This is a good thing.

1066
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,040
Sure!

1067
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,760
I think it's negotiable.

1068
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,400
Does everyone agree?

1069
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
Agree!

He also agrees!

1072
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,880
Approved!

1073

What are you doing?

1087
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,480
Let me tell you something.

1088
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,880
Uncle Li, I want to say this to you.

1089
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,960
I have already gone to Peking University.

1090
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,200
I found that your body is better than mine.

1091
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,640
But your health alone doesn't work.

1092
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,560
You say that the words you know now

1093
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,240
are not enough for you.

1094
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,680
It's embarrassing to say it.

1095
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,120
We open this evening school

1096
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
to teach reading and writing.

1097
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,480
It's free.

1098
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,840
Many good things.

1099
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,880
It's free, really?

1100
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,840
It's free.

1101
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,920
All the best professors, the best sir.

1102
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,400
Where else can you find this opportunity?

1103
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,920
Can my son learn?

1104
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,040
Your son?

1105
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,160
Uncle, it's this:

1106
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,800
Our night school

1107
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
only admits our own workers,

1108
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,240
we don't accept family members.

1109
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,200
Then forget it.

1110
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,240
Then I won't study. I won't study.

1111
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
Uncle Li, uncle Li, uncle Li!

1112
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,760
He can! He can!

1113
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,640
Can he?

1114
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,600
Stop running, stop running.

1115
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,080
He can.

1116
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,640
I won't run, I won't run.

1117
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,600
He can. You say:

1118
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,600
The more people who want to read, the better.

1119
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,840
I am in charge of this matter.

1120
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,680
The day after tomorrow, you and your son

1121
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
can attend the first class of our evening school.

1122
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,240
Is that okay?

1123
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,080
Okay, okay, that's what you said.

1124
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
It's free. It's free.

1125
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,760
No money, no money.

1126
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,720
Okay, okay, okay.

1127
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,240
Then I'll go home and tell my son

1128
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,320
to study the day after tomorrow. Come on!

1129
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,638
Good.

1130
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,103
It's a deal, Uncle Li.

1131
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,400
Well, I'll go first.

1132
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,040
Okay, go.

1133
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,680
Tell my son to go home.

1134
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,640
I wrote it down for you.

1135
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,680
good

1136
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,400
come on

1137
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,600
This child, come again.

1138
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,800
See you soon!

1139
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,320
Uncle Wang!

1140
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
Uncle Wang, uncle Wang!

1141
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,120
Our evening classes will start the day after tomorrow.

1142
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,480
You must remember to come then.

1143
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,080
Let's settle the matter.

1144
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,680
Why is that settled?

1145
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,520
I don't have the free time.

1146
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,120
Uncle Wang!

1147
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Don't run!

1148
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,000
What's wrong with reading?

1149
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,760
Evening school?

1150
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,640
Yes!

1151
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,920
Do you want to go?

1152
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,200
Don't first ask

1153
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,240
if we want to go.

1154
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,000
We want to first ask you:

1155
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,600
are you kidding us?

1156
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,520
Not kidding.

1157
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,960
Our night school

1158
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,920
is specially prepared

1159
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
for our industrial development.

1160
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,480
As long as you want to participate,

1161
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,920
I'll fill out the form for you.

1162
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,280
I want to ask you something.

1163
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,880
Can people like me

1164
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,320
also go to school?

1165
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,200
All of us

1166
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,560
are the greatest laborers,

1167
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,320
the most qualified to learn.

1168
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,440
Then I'll go!

1169
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,240
I'll go too!

1170
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,160
Good!

1171
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
I'll register you right away.

1172
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:55,920
Good!

1173
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,880
Do these masters want to go?

1174
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm old.

1175
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,960
I won't go.

1176
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,880
Ah, I'm so stupid.

1177
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,280
I'm so stupid.

1178
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,320
I'm scared of not learning.

1179
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,600
I don't know a word.

1180
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,880
It is also a waste of time

1181
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,840
to go.

1182
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,160
Paint!

1183
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,760
Got it!

1184
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,600
Because we can't read,

1185
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,760
we need to learn more.

1186
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,760
You see,

1187
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,360
for us laborers in Peking University,

1188
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,640
what is the most inconvenient thing?

1189
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,920
A little higher.

1190
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,000
Ah, wait a minute.

1191
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,640
Here, master.

1192
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,200
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1193
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,080
Here.

1194
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,720
Thank you.

1195
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,680
Here, master.

1196
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,440
Thank you, thank you.

1197
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,160
Thank you.

1198
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,600
As I said.

1199
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,960
Masters

1200
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,680
You see,

1201
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,600
for us laborers in Peking University,

1202
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,640
the most inconvenient thing

1203
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,920
is to speak,

1204
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,120
to be able to speak but not write.

1205
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
Someone people write.

1206
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,440
We are also not literate.

1207
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,160
Accounts

1208
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,200
are sometimes calculated

1209
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,160
but not recorded.

1210
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,760
As you usually say,

1211
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,920
it is inconvenient to do anything.

1212
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,920
You said that

1213
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,120
to my heart.

1214
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,240
Look, I'm taking

1215
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
these collegues to work.

1216
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,960
Getting materials.

1217
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,840
Dividing the wages.

1218
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,720
This,

1219
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,760
I can figure out,

1220
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,200
but I can't write.

1221
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,400
I'm so worried!

1222
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,840
In the house where I live,

1223
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
all the walls are painted with bars.

1224
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,760
There are too many bars painted here.

1225
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,280
You don't remember it yourself.

1226
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,120
I don't remember your salary, and I don't owe you.

1227
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,080
Not a problem.

1228
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,280
Not anymore.

1229
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,320
Our Peking University

1230
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,840
has set up a night school

1231
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,800
for our laborers.

1232
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,920
And

1233
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,040
all of them are invited by our school's

1234
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,160
most famous teacher

1235
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,080
to teach us to read,

1236
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,600
write letters, and settle accounts.

1237
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,640
Teaching

1238
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
is our most useful knowledge at ordinary times.

1239
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,080
The key is

1240
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,520
there is no charge for going to school.

1241
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,760
Textbooks are also free.

1242
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,880
We are a night school.

1243
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
It won't delay our work during the day.

1244
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,480
What a good thing this is!

1245
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,240
What do you mean?

1246
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,920
You mean to say

1247
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,960
that Peking University

1248
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,480
is giving us poor people

1249
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
a charity school.

1250
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,760
It's not just a charity school,

1251
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,880
it's to respect your

1252
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,320
right to education.

1253
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,480
What is a right?

1254
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,400
I'm confused when you say this again.

1255
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,320
That is, Peking University runs an evening school

1256
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,080
specially for our workers

1257
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,200
to gain knowledge.

1258
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,880
When we gain knowledge

1259
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,680
and culture,

1260
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,880
it is convenient for us to do our work.

1261
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,680
You?

1262
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,200
You can also go home and teach your grandchildren.

1263
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,560
For yourself,

1264
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,160
for your families and schools.

1265
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,040
Help everyone!

1266
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,080
Is it a good thing?

1267
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,040
Master, don't worry.

1268
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,800
If there is any fee to pay,

1269
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,440
you all

1270
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,640
can come to me:

1271
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,240
Mao Zedong!

1272
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,680
Did you hear that?

1273
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,880
Does everyone understand?

1274
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,760
We understand!

1275
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,640
We all

1276
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,080
just go to school with peace of mind!

1277
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
In case someone asks us for money,

1278
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
let's find Mao Zedong.

1279
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,040
Look for me. Look for me.

1280
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,600
Good!

1281
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,040
We garden workers

1282
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,480
can now all go to school!
