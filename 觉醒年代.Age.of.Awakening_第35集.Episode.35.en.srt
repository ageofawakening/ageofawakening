[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,238
[Episode Thirty-five]

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,440
Shouchang, I have made up my mind.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,960
Let's meet at Dagoutou tomorrow noon.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,120
We're half each other. 

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,560
Go at night.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,000
You know what?

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,480
We'll talk about this tomorrow when we meet.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,400
Give me the manuscript first.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,680
About handing out flyers tomorrow

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
Don't let Yannian know

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
Don't involve Yannian, either.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,600
I don't want him involved.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,200
come on

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,160
Why did you come back alone?

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,680
Uncle Hu threw up. auntie is helping to clean up.

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,360
I asked you why you came back alone.

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,440
Who told you to come back?

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,760
I came back by myself

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,520
Let me ask you something. 

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,800
Will you hand out leaflets tomorrow?

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,320
I won't go./I won't be there.

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
Shouchang has already arranged it. 

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,960
I'll print the flyer.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,680
need not

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,280
I've already arranged everything.

27
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
This declaration and wax paper

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,640
We started from Dagoutou.

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
From the mimeograph agency on the 18th.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,320
We analyze

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
It's very likely that this declaration was circulated internally.

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,320
Or just post it downtown.

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,240
Judging from the writing and handwriting of this declaration

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
Chen Duxiu should have done it.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,040
So he's probably

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,480
Will personally deal with this declaration.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
It is recommended to immediately in downtown areas.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,280
Increase plainclothes police force 

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
Strive to catch the perpetrators on the spot.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,840
You mean that

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,040
陈独秀和李大钊

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Will hand out leaflets in person.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,320
With my research on Chen Duxiu

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
It's not completely impossible.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
Even if it's not Chen Duxiu.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,480
We can also follow the trail.

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Just confirm.

48
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,280


49
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,760
Just confirm.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,200
This "Beijing Citizen Declaration"

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,480
It was drafted by Chen Duxiu

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,280
You can arrest him as well.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,600
Catch Chen Duxiu, I'll give you a credit.

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:07,680


55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,640
Catch Chen Duxiu, I'll give you a credit.

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,520
be

57
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,920
Stop pretending, Jenny.

58
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,760
I can't eat so much alone. 

59
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
Jenny doesn't have any good gifts for you either.

60
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,840
I know you like to eat my steamed stuffed bun.

61
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,520
Bring you more food for the road.

62
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm here to say goodbye to you and your husband

63
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840
And I took it with me.

64
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,040
it doesn't matter

65
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Come and pack it.

66
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
YannianQiaonian

67
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,520
You two are not going to see me off? 

68
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,800
Send it.

69
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,280
Send off

70
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
We'll send you all.

71
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,040
Qunxian

72
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,880
Yes, sir.

73
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
I came to say goodbye to you.

74
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,040
know

75
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,360
I'll give you a present when you leave.

76
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,640
Wrote a picture.

77
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,440
Nvwa is Jingwei.

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Qushi buried in the East China Sea 

79
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,480


80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,560


81
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:32,800
Hengdonghai

82
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,480
East China sea water is unreasonable 

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
The girl's heart has changed.

84
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
Kuafu Zouyuyuan

85
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
Treat each other by day.

86
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,840
Nao Jinshi Xin

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Sit idly by and regret

88
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,360
This poem was written in 1910.

89
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,800
I wrote it when I was in the deepest depression in Hangzhou.

90
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
One of ten poems.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,880
Mainly to express

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,320
Want to be a revolutionary

93
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't be afraid of failure.

94
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
Have an indomitable spirit.

95
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
Send it to you young people today.

96
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,560
Let's say it's a hope.

97
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,120
Thanks again, sir

98
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
Let's go, don't miss the train.

99
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,080
good

100
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,520
I'll walk you out.

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,160
good

102
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
Goodbye, sir.

103
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,080
See you first, sister.

104
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Goodbye, Tsunami Tsunami.

105
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,200
Tsunami Kazumi

106
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


107
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,680
Tsunami Kazumi

108
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:21,760


109
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,160
Tsunami Kazumi

110
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,960
come

111
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
Dad will wash the pigeon cage with you.

112
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,120
Dad doesn't like Ying Ying, does he? 

113
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,720
Who says I don't like Ying Ying?

114
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,040
Ying Ying Baiyun Lu bi ying Mao

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
Of course I like it.

116
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,920
Sister, look, Ying Ying's eyes are so bright.

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
Shouchang, where are they

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,160
They have gone to the south amusement park.

119
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
It's agreed that after the leaflets are distributed.

120
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,600
Everybody gather in the Red Chamber Library.

121
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,640
Didn't you say this is the busiest place in Beijing?

122
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,040
I don't think there are many people.

123
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Wait a little longer.

124
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,840
Don't worry, don't worry

125
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
Sir, this way.

126
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,800
come

127
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,320
You take the seat.

128
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,080
Okay, okay, okay.

129
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
good

130
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,880
middle

131
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,240
such

132
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
You are in charge of keeping watch.

133
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,800
Shiyan, you're in charge.

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
You'll be there later. 

135
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,120
good

136
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm going to the second floor.

137
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,400
The target on the second floor is too big to be killed. 

138
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,120
I'd better go.

139
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
It's okay. Leave it to me.

140
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,600
sir

141
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,440
If something happens later

142
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,800
You must withdraw to the west gate. 

143
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Let Master Ge and Xiaoshan

144
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,880
Coordinate with us over there

145
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
What do you tell them about this little thing?

146
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,960
Now you are the most wanted person in the police department.

147
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,240
I'm afraid of danger

148
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,760
Shiyan, you go to Master Ge and them.

149
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,520
Wait for my signal.

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,560
let’s begin

151
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,280
good

152
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,400
good

153
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
Almost there. Let's go 

154
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
Okay, let's go down and scatter it.

155
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,400
Where are you going?

156
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
Don't even think about it here.

157
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,400
Spreading leaflets upstairs is the most dangerous thing.

158
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,680
Once it's blocked

159
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,880
There is no place to retreat.

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,080
Look, there are so many people down there now. 

161
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,360
Let's mingle with the crowd.

162
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,320
All the way, all the way.

163
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,280
The road is so long.

164
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,400
In case something else happens.

165
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
If you want to return it, you can return it in all directions.

166
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,760
good

167
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
You go down first, and I'll follow.

168
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
Two people have a big goal together.

169
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
You go first.

170
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,320
Separate

171
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
Ok, let's sprinkle at the same time

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,560
good

173
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,840
Nuxiao

174
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
Even if he falls.

175
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
Kill him in the middle of nowhere. 

176
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
Kill him in the middle of nowhere. 

177
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
Take the thief's nest alone

178
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm going to sweep up the show.

179
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm going to sweep up the show.

180
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,960
A horse rushed out of the battlefield way

181
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,240
I must shake down my power and prestige to sweep away the thief.

182
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,680
What's going on

183
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,800
What?

184
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,080
What's this? This

185
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,640
Fellow citizens

186
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
draw together

187
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
Resolutely resist the shameless Paris Peace Treaty

188
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,800
Fellow citizens

189
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,880
Please look at the Beijing Citizen Manifesto.

190
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400

266
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160

268
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,760

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,800

You guys stay.

273
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,440
Take care of two little ones sleeping at home. 

274
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:57,920


275
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,120
Qian Fang is not allowed to go out. 

276
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
Yannian, you go to Mr. Shouchang's house

277
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,640
Qiaonian and I will go to Mr. Shizhi's house.

278
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,120
good

279
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,560
Let's keep looking for it.

280
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,080
Chen Duxiu has been arrested for disturbing public order.

281
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,280
We were ordered to search.

282
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,720
Search for me.

283
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,960
Everybody in the back, come here!

284
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,840
What's your name?

285
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,280
Chen Yannian

286
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,600
Chen Yannian

287
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,880
What about you?

288
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,080
Chen Qiaonian

289
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,040
you

290
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,720
Bai Lan

291
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,000
Qian you?

292
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,880
I tell you.

293
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
Now you're just ordered to search 

294
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,320
If you dare to hurt my family

295
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,600
Dare to touch a child's finger

296
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,800
I'll fight you with my life. 

297
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,800
Check it carefully for me.

298
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,680
pass

299
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,560
Nobody move.

300
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,440
return

301
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,120
Shouchang

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,920
Something's wrong. Something's wrong 

303
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,320
中富兄呢

304
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,760
Zhongfu was caught by the police. 

305
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,360
The scene was a mess.

306
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
I ran out of here in disorder.

307
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,480
Where has Zhongfu been caught?

308
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,440
Unclear

309
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
Zhongfu shouted loudly when he was caught by the police. 

310
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,320
I

311
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,000
I didn't dare to stay there and ask more questions. 

312
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,560
sir

313
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,360
I

314
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,160
sir

315
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,920
I can't stay here any longer.

316
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,200
The police will be here soon.

317
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,400
Go out and hide.

318
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Don't panic, don't mess around.

319
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,320
Make it clear what's going on. 

320
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,840
My father has been detained.

321
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,680
The police just searched my house.

322
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,960
Please leave Beijing quickly.

323
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,840
It's too dangerous here.

324
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,480
I'll save him.

325
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,520
Sir, you can't go

326
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,320
Shouchang, you can't go

327
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,760
You dare not show your face outside again.

328
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
Didn't you listen to Yannian?

329
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,280
The police are arresting you everywhere.

330
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,560
You have to run quickly.

331
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,280
run

332
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,800
Where am I going?

333
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,920
I want to get him out.

334
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,960
寿昌先生

335
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,920
You don't listen to me now.

336
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,920
Zhongfu belongs to celebrities.

337
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,680
The police should not dare to do anything to him.

338
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,040
He will naturally be rescued.

339
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
But your situation is different from Zhongfu's.

340
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,280
You have to get out and hide.

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
Han, let me tell you something.

342
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,360
No, save brother Zhongfu

343
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,480
I'm not going anywhere.

344
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,440
Sir, what are you

345
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,800
What are you holding me for?

346
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,040
Shouchang, why are you so confused?

347
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Just go back to your hometown in Hebei for a while.

348
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,360
When will the situation here come down?

349
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,880
We'll pick you up again.

350
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,760
sir

351
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,480
Liu Yipin has come here with the police.

352
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
Said to check Chen Xuechang's office.

353
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,040
And libraries.

354
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
Mr. Shouchang, you have to go quickly

355
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,320
Don't panic, everyone. Calm down

356
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,280
Let's split the work.

357
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
Master Haige

358
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,360
Xiaoshan

359
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,880
You three escort Mr. Shouchang out of town.

360
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,920
YannianShiyan

361
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,040
You go to Mr. Hu Shi

362
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
Let him inform the news media.

363
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,320
Try every means to rescue Mr. Zhongfu.

364
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Mr. Yihan, please.

365
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,280
Please

366
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
The arrest of Mr. Zhongfu 

367
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,000
Write it down in detail

368
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,880
We should inform the Federation of Students. 

369
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,160
Sir, there is no time.

370
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,960
Let's go.

371
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,680
I'm not leaving.

372
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
Let's go.

373
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,160
I won't.

374
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,640
hurry along

375
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,360
foregone

376
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:07,840
good

377
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,400
Are you kidding?

378
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,160
Socialite

379
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,760
The leader of the new culture

380
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Can you talk with your foot dart handcuffed?

381
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,600
You're afraid he'll fly?

382
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,040
Don't open it for him.

383
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,160
be

384
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,400
key

385
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,200
Go, go, go, take away

386
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,680
You all go down.

387
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,880
be

388
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,200
Let's meet again.

389
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,360
Director Wu

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,840
Looks like you arranged this meeting.

391
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,280
It took a lot of effort.

392
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,240
exactly

393
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,080
To invite someone as important as you here.

394
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,640
But I tried my best to move mountains.

395
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,720
Why should you arrest me?

396
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,840
have a look at

397
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,200
I Wu Bingxiang

398
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,240
Never do anything you are not sure about.

399
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,000
Let me read it to you.

400
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,400
Professor Cha Peking University Chen Duxiu

401
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,080
Private printing and dissemination of printed matter

402
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,680
Spreading radicalism

403
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,960
Incite the people to oppose the government and disturb the peace.

404
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,440
Be detained for review 

405
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
I am a citizen of the Republic of China.

406
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,560
I love my home.

407
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,880
Distribute leaflets in public

408
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,040
Request to refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

409
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,160
Severely punish traitors

410
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
What's the crime of this patriotic act? 

411
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,880
Professor Chen

412
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,320
I want to remind you that

413
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,400
This isn't you, Peking University.

414
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,880
A forum for academic discussion.

415
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,200
Are you guilty?

416
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
You say not

417
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
The law has the final say.

418
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
Now that you are here. 

419
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,040
You have to be judged by the law.

420
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,040
But I also want to tell you.

421
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,000
You'd better make this mental preparation.

422
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,840
I'm afraid you'll have to stay here a few more days. 

423
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll stay here, Meiwen 

424
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
What worries me is

425
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,440
How will your director Wu end up in the future? 

426
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,080
You're right.

427
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
The news that you Chen Duxiu were arrested today

428
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,240
Meridian transmission

429
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,040
That must be the headlines of major newspapers.

430
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,440
This city and even China. 

431
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,840
What will it be like?

432
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,280
It's hard to say. 

433
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,120
Maybe I Wu Bingxiang will become 

434
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,400
After Cao Zhanglu

435
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,880
The fourth traitor who was criticized.

436
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,560
But let me tell you something.

437
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,240
Since I can invite you here

438
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
I made all the preparations.

439
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,120
I will never give up halfway.

440
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,520
Very good, very determined.

441
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,360
Courage

442
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,360
Professor Chen, let me tell you something.

443
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,040
Nian and I are fellow villagers. 

444
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,120
I should take care of you. 

445
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,440
Say, what terms do you want to make here?

446
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,640
Just speak.

447
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
Then I'll be blunt.

448
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,880
Go ahead, please.

449
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,560
I hope I have the right to read and write.

450
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,160
Of course you can.

451
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
Solitary confinement

452
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:03,680


453
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,960
But what you write can't get out.

454
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,680
that

455
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,360
No hair, no hair

456
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,160
As long as I can read and write.

457
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,680
For me

458
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,240
Prison and laboratory are the same thing.

459
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
Professor Chen, let me tell you something.

460
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,080
You wouldn't be Professor Chen here.

461
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,520
Who am I then?

462
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,560
You are a very important suspect in the police department.

463
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,120
They want to give you a number.

464
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,400
Replace your name.

465
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,680
number

466
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,720
What number is he?

467
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,560
No.78

468
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,480
Qiba

469
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,840
No.78

470
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,400
I hope you can behave yourself.

471
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
I will often come to see you.

472
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,800
messenger

473
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,280
arrive

474
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,800
Take the number one seven eight to his new house. 

475
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,360
be

476
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,160
good

477
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,920
come on

478
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,640
Please

479
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,160
Go by yourself.

480
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,720
please

481
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,480
Teachers!

482
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,920
Fellow students

483
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,200
Just yesterday

484
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,840
Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai

485
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,600
Met Xu Shichang.

486
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,280
Duan Qirui's peace talks representative

487
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,480
He solemnly proposed to them at the meeting

488
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
About the arrest of Mr. Chen Duxiu

489
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
Dr. Sun Yat-sen said this.

490
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,960
My companions and I were very shocked.

491
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,720
Your thousand good deeds

492
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
Enough to convince all citizens.

493
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,960
I am right to oppose you.

494
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
But I don't think you dare kill him.

495
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
For killing a man.

496
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
There will be fifty.

497
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,760
One hundred

498
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,680
So just do it.

499
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,040
classmates

500
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,360
I call everyone to unite again.

501
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,760
Protest against the government's arrest for no reason

502
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,640
Release Mr. Chen Duxiu immediately

503
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,560
Protest against the government's arrest for no reason

504
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,560
Release Mr. Chen Duxiu immediately

505
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
Protest against the government's arrest for no reason

506
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
Release Mr. Chen Duxiu immediately

507
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Zhong tong Xue

508
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,080
Recently, Beijing students

509
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,120
And rescue Zhongfu from all walks of life is very good.

510
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,680
Only rescue activities should be related to refusing to sign the Paris Peace Treaty. 

511
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,400
Cai took action to severely punish traitors, etc.

512
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,600
It is more effective to combine closely.

513
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
Zhongfu flies to the fire

514
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,880
Intended to promote the May 4th Movement.

515
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,880
Develop to a deeper level

516
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,760
Don't let down his pains. 

517
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,160
You should understand.

518
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,440
To force the reactionary government to refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

519
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,560
Is the latest goal of this movement.

520
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,880
Shizhi asked us to come.

521
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,160
What are you doing?

522
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,120
He probably has something to do with magazines.

523
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,680
Now Mr. Cai has left without return.

524
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,960
Hu Renyuan, the new principal, is afraid to take office. 

525
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
Zhongfu was arrested and Shouchang took refuge.

526
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,000
Peking University is at the center of the political vortex. 

527
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,640
It's a lot of fate 

528
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,080
In an eventful autumn

529
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,200
We also look at the actual needs.

530
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,040
Think positively about the countermeasures. 

531
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,600
ladies and gentlemen

532
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,160
Shizhi

533
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Sorry for being late.

534
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:28,880


535
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,360
Sorry for being late.

536
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,400
Just now in the classroom.

537
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,680
Answering questions for students.

538
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,280
Call everyone over today.

539
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,200
The possibility is clear to everyone.

540
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
Zhongfu goes to jail and Shouchang goes out of Beijing.

541
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
Now our "New Youth"

542
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:43,920
And the Weekly Review.

543
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,840
Are in a state of suspension of publication.

544
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,760
What should I do next?

545
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,120
I made my own decisions.

546
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,200
Please invite your colleagues to make a decision.

547
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,920
Shizhi's top priority is to rescue Zhongfu.

548
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
He founded and is responsible for both publications.

549
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,080
It's hard for others to take over without him.

550
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,320
this

551
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Actually, I invited everyone here. 

552
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,840
I have an idea.

553
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,520
I think twice about this idea.

554
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,160
I feel that at this time of crisis

555
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,480
I should be brave enough to take more responsibility.

556
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,480
So I want to volunteer.

557
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,320
To undertake the editing of two magazines.

558
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,880
I don't know what you think

559
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
I don't trust you, Shizhi.

560
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,120
Brother Zhongfu of New Youth brought it.

561
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,960
He's not here. I thought

562
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,640
None of us can replace him.

563
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,320
It's better to stop first.

564
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
Let's talk about it after brother Zhongfu gets out of prison.

565
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
As for the Weekly Review

566
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,200
Look at the present

567
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,440
It seems to have a great effect on rescuing Zhongfu. 

568
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,960
It should be continued.

569
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
I agree with Mr. Lu Xun. 

570
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,880
The Weekly Review must continue.

571
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,880
I agree with Lu Xun.

572
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,560
"New Youth" is suspended

573
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
The Weekly Review can be taken over by Shizhi.

574
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
I will try my best.

575
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
In addition, Mr. Shouchang also suggested that

576
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,760
We should take advantage of the situation.

577
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,520
Establish the National Federation of Students as soon as possible.

578
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,160
Schools all over the country are widely

579
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,160


580
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,920
Use this fuse

581
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,080
Integrate the national student forces together. 

582
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,320
A unified leading body.

583
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,560
This is an excellent opportunity.

584
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,760
I propose to set up the All-China Federation of Students in Shanghai. 

585
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,600
Because now it looks like

586
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,400
Shanghai has become the center of the national movement. 

587
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,160
Li Dazhao

588
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,000
nicely

589
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
There is hope.

590
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,360
classmates

591
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,120
In today's Weekly Review 

592
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,080
Published a short poem.

593
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,440
《怀陈独秀》

594
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,880
There was a strong response among the students. 

595
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,720
How about I read it to you?

596
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,280
good

597
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:03,520
good

598
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,400
According to their claim

599
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,640
Our common people are suffering.

600
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,640
According to your opinion

601
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,040
They are in pain.

602
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,760
They don't want pain.

603
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,200
So you're in pain.

604
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,360
You are in pain.

605
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
Is to suffer for us.

606
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,240
Petition representatives from various provinces in Beijing 

607
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,600
Then he will petition the presidential palace.

608
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,120
It's been a long journey for you.

609
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
Nothing. I'm used to walking on mountain roads.

610
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,000
Yannian is just ahead. 

611
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,600
Yannian

612
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:02,880
Yannian

613
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,480


614
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,640
This is the president of Shaanxi Students Federation.

615
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,400
This is Chen Yannian.

616
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,280
Hello, hello, hello.

617
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,760
Hello, hello, hello.

618
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,720
We Shaanxi students

619
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,640
I admire Mr. Chen Duxiu very much

620
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
So I was asked to bring this pennant.

621
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,360
Pay tribute.

622
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,200
Please also forward it for you.

623
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,680
thank

624
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,960
I'm sorry for my father.

625
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,640
classmates

626
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,400
classmates

627
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,040
The day of signing the Paris Peace Treaty is coming.

628
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,360
Beiyang government has electrified all provinces.

629
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
And Lu Zhengxiang, Paris.

630
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
If the protest is invalid

631
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,640
Just sign the peace treaty

632
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,680
From today, Beijing and Paris will join forces.

633
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,360
Petition representatives from various provinces in Beijing 

634
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,960
Then he will petition the presidential palace.

635
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,800
Never retreat until you see Xu Shichang.

636
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,560
There will be 30,000 Chinese in Paris 

637
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,840
Surround the Chinese envoy's residence. 

638
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,120
And Lu Zhengxiang residence.

639
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,720
Resolutely prevent the Chinese representative from signing.

640
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,920
Our Beijing Federation of Students

641
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
Will actively cooperate with provincial petition representatives.

642
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,120
And make backup.

643
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,680
Students' success or failure is at stake.

644
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,760
Never give up until you reach it.

645
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
Never give up until you reach your goal.

646
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,360
Brother Ju Ren

647
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,080
Forgive me. I really can't be with you.

648
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,760
Look at your little promise

649
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,920
A Chen Duxiu scared you like this?

650
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,240
I

651
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,440
sit

652
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,920
Brother Ju Ren

653
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,920
Then Chen DuxiuLi Dazhao 

654
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
And the student movement they lead. 

655
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,520
It's a disaster.

656
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,000
They represent a trend.

657
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,560
You can't stop it at all.

658
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,880
This world is really going to change.

659
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,840
You said China for thousands of years.

660
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
What scares the ruler. 

661
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,640
Capable of changing dynasties

662
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,280
That is, the peasant uprising.

663
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,360
But now the peasants have not rebelled.

664
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,240
can

665
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,680
The scholar rebelled.

666
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,000
It's turned upside down.

667
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,160
And don't eat hard and soft.

668
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,360
Take him out of temper.

669
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
Peasant uprising is not terrible.

670
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,680
Don't you change the course of the peasant uprising? 

671
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,600
But now these people

672
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,360
They're not only going to change direction.

673
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
We have to change our course.

674
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,680
Gainaotou

675
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,200
Gainaotou

676
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,360
What do you mean?

677
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,000
Ideological theory

678
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
They want to transform China with foreign theories.

679
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,720
theory

680
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,280
What theory? This is what you say.

681
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,640
I don't know.

682
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,240
All I know is that I am behind the times.

683
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,680
A swift retreat can save a little face.

684
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,040
Carry to the end

685
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
Can only be remembered for thousands of years.

686
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,040
Brother Ju Ren

687
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,160
Just give me a break.

688
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Okay, okay, okay.

689
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,520
come on

690
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,120
come on

691
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,840
retreat before the rapids―retire resolutely at the height of one's official career

692
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,120
Save your face.

693
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,360
come on

694
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:47,520


695
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,360
I can't walk anymore.

696
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,000
I can only be remembered.

697
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,120
June 27th, 1919

698
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,760
And hundreds of representatives from petition groups in Beijing. 

699
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,200
Petition to the Presidential Palace

700
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,480
Ask Beiyang government to refuse to sign the peace treaty.

701
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,320
After two days and one night of struggle

702
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,680
Twenty-eighth night

703
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,320
Xu Shichang was forced to meet with ten delegates.

704
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,000
Shaanxi represents Qu Wu.

705
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,840
Struggle head-to-head with death based on patriotic indignation.

706
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
History says "Blood spattered on the Presidential Palace"

707
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,520
Xu Shichang was forced to agree to the students' demands. 

708
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
Ah, let's eat and work 

709
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,280
Do you mind eating halal today?

710
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
No comment

711
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,320
classmates

712
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,240
We jointly sponsored by Beijing and Tianjin.

713
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,000
Cai saves Chen's petition

714
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,920
It can be said to be a great success 

715
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,240
Everyone is United with one heart and one mind

716
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,000
Not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice

717
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,960
Especially our president, Ma Jun.

718
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
For our Tianjin academic circles

719
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,080
Is the glory of the fame.

720
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,240
Don't we have to congratulate?

721
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,520
clap one's hands

722
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,120
You said so.

723
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,160
I'm sorry

724
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,240
The old horse is really powerful.

725
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,720


726
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,200
It's really worthy of your beard

727
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
A roar in front of Yangqiao.

728
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,320
I see

729
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
Don't call yourself Ma Jun from now on.

730
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,200
Change your name to Ma Tianan.

731
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,720
That's a good name.

732
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,680
That's a good idea.

733
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,960
Everybody, journalists!

734
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,080
start from today

735
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,520
My name is Ma Tianan.

736
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,520
This name is loud and clear.

737
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,560
Memorable

738
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,680
Ma Tianan

739
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,200
Don't be too proud.

740
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,560
I want to give you a piece of advice.

741
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,000
There are five or six hundred people from our Tianjin Federation of Students this time.

742
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
But there is no unified command.

743
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,080
Patriotic comrades in the academic and female circles. 

744
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,920
Will go their own way and distract the power.

745
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,760
As a result, many students left the team.

746
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,400
I think it's a great lesson.

747
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,200
exactly

748
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Our female classmates were notified late.

749
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,880
They almost blocked it back.

750
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
It's my fault.

751
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm late in the notice.

752
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,760
It's not your personal business either.

753
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
It's an organizational problem.

754
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
I have a proposal.

755
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,360
Please merge your Tianjin Federation of Students with us.

756
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,000
Form a unified leading body.

757
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,440
But also can afford it.

758
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,160
What about the leadership responsibility of Tianjin Patriotic Youth Movement? 

759
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,200
What do you think?

760
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,240
This suggestion is good.

761
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,520
I agree

762
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,720
I agree

763
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,840
I think

764
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,000
It is not necessary to merge the two organizations.

765
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,040
foremost

766
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,360
Is to build an academic community that can become Tianjin. 

767
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,800
The core team of the backbone

768
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,600
so

769
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,800
I suggest that the backbone of the Federation of Students and the Women's Lesbian Association

770
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,680
organize

771
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,320
Set up a more tightly organized patriotic group.

772
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
Not only leading the student movement

773
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,280
We also need to conduct scientific and new ideological research.

774
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,720
Publish a publication at the same time

775
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,920
Guide students' movement

776
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,400
Become the leading core of Tianjin academic circles.

777
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,520
I think so.

778
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,840
Brother Lai, this proposal is very good.

779
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,040
What about me?

780
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,200
Raise your hands in agreement.

781
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,840
thank you

782
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,600
And sign up.

783
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,640
I also think Enlai's opinion stands higher.

784
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,600
I agree

785
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,600
I agree. I agree, too. 

786
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,280
Nalai

787
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,440
The preparatory work of this organization

788
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,640
Let's leave it to you.

789
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,360
no problem

790
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,960
You patriotic gay women's association

791
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,560
Send a man to assist him.

792
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,160
Then, Wen Shu, come.

793
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:32,880
good

794
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,600
Let's think of a name for this organization.

795
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,880
I guess

796
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,880
Our organization is called

797
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,080
Jueshe bar

798
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,000
Jueshe

799
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,560
Duijieshe

800
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,360
We will go to Beijing in a few days. 

801
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,680
Ask Mr. Li Dazhao to give us some advice.

802
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,000
That's a good idea.

803
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,040
eat rice

804
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,840
Laihao

805
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,840
I read in the newspaper that

806
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,600
These days, the French have been treating the Chinese. 

807
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,080
I'm all impressed.

808
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,800
I saw it all from scratch.

809
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,720
They think

810
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,480
Chinese people are so bloody.

811
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,560
The sleeping lion was finally awakened.

812
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,880
It's not easy

813
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,760
I heard that the Chinese have organized death squads.

814
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Three people for a minister's life. 

815
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
There are so many applicants.

816
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,960
Qingdao is ours.

817
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,440
Qingdao is ours.

818
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,960
Shandong is ours.

819
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,320
I really want to go down.

820
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,400
Tell them what I think
