Zhang Zongxiang, Cao Rulin

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
must be expelled from Beijing!

191
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,840
Everyone should unite!

00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,120
from Beijing!

201
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,640
How daring to spread that!

202
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
He doesn't want to live anymore, does he?

203
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,400
Yeah.

204
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,520
Fellow citizens,

205
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,960
here comes the police!

206
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,320
Go quickly!

207
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680

208
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,280

Everyone should unite!

211
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,000
Grab the white one, that one!

212
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,800
Don't run!

213
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,040
Don't run!

214
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
Fellow citizens,

215
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,320
unite together!

216
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,440
Second floor!

217
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,040
Fellow citizens,

218
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,280
unite together!

219
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,680
Fellow citizens!

220
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,800
Sir, let's go!

221
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
Look, there's more.

222
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
What's this? It's

223
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,320
the "Beijing Citizen Manifesto".

224
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,480
Get into action!

225
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,640
Get into action!

226
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,835
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

227
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:15,680
Get out of the way!

228
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,635
Get out of the way!

229
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:19,280
Get out of the way!

230
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,080
Don't let him get away!

231
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,600
Get out of the way!

232
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,640
Chen Duxiu!

233
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,760
Go upstairs!

234
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,800
Go get him!

235
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
Go upstairs! Go upstairs!

236
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,720
Come down quickly!

237
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,760
And him!

238
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,880
Grab him! Don't let him get away!

239
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,600
There is another one over there!

240
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,320
Get him! Get him!

241
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Stop!

242
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,200
Stay close to him!

243
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,960
Get into action!

244
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,200
Chen Duxiu?

245
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,113
Get down!

246
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:52,880
Hurry up and get down!

247
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,160
Students,

248
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,520
merchants,

249
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,800
labourers,

250
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,920
soldiers!

251
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,600
Resolutely resist the humiliating Paris Peace Treaty!

252
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,640
Shut up! Shut up!

253
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,440
Shut up!

254
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,320
Shut up!

255
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,680
Take him away!

256
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,680
Move! Move!

257
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,320
Keep moving!

258
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:26,880
Move!

259
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,120
Done.

260
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,720
Rub some oil.

261
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,640
Mom!

262
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
Mom will wipe it on you right away.

263
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,760
Come.

264
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,760
What's going on?

265
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
I have searched the first, second, third colleges and the Red Building.

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,640
No one.

267
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,800
So Liu Mei, Bai Lan,

268
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
you guys stay.

269
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,440
Take care of two little ones sleeping at home.

270
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,120
Don't go out!

271
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
Yannian, you go to Mr. Shouchang's house

272
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,640
Qiaonian and I will go to Mr. Shizhi's house.

273
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,120
Okay.

274
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,560
Let's keep looking for him.

275
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,080
Chen Duxiu has been arrested for disturbing public order.

276
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,280
We were ordered to search.

277
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,720
Search!

278
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,960
Everybody in the back, come here!

279
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,840
You! What's your name?

280
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,600
Chen Yannian.

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,880
What about you?

282
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,080
Chen Qiaonian.

283
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,040
You!

284
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,720
Bai Lan.

285
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,000
What are you doing?

286
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm telling you,

287
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
now you're just ordered to search.

288
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,320
If you dare to hurt my family,

289
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,600
dare to touch a child's finger,

290
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,800
I'll fight you with my life.

291
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,800
Check them carefully for me.

292
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,680
Don't move.

293
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,560
Nobody move.

294
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,440
Get back.

295
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,120
Shouchang.

296
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,920
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

297
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,320
Brother Zhongfu.

298
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,760
Zhongfu was caught by the police.

299
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,360
The scene was a mess.

300
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
I also took advantage of the chaos to get out.

301
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,480
Where has Zhongfu been caught?

302
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,440
Unclear.

303
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
Zhongfu shouted loudly when he was caught by the police.

304
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,320
I--

305
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,000
I didn't dare to stay there and ask more questions.

306
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,560
Sir.

307
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,360
I--

308
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,160
Sir.

309
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,920
I can't stay here any longer.

310
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,200
The police will be here soon.

311
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,400
Go out and hide.

312
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Don't panic, don't mess around.

313
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,320
Make it clear what's going on.

314
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,840
My father has been detained.

315
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,680
The police just searched my house.

316
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,960
Please leave Beijing quickly.

317
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,840
It's too dangerous here.

318
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,480
I'll save him.

319
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,520
Sir, you can't go.

320
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,320
Shouchang, you can't go.

321
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,760
You dare not show your face outside again.

322
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
Didn't you listen to Yannian?

323
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,280
The police are looking everywhere to arrest you.

324
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,560
You have to run quickly.

325
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,280
Run?

326
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,800
Where am I going?

327
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,920
I want to get him out.

328
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,960
Mr. Shouchang.

329
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,920
You're not listening to me now.

330
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,920
Zhongfu is a celebrity.

331
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,680
The police should not dare to do anything to him.

332
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,040
He will naturally be rescued.

333
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
But your situation is different from Zhongfu's.

334
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,280
You have to get out and hide.

335
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
Yihan, let me tell you.

336
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,360
If I'm not saving brother Zhongfu,

337
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,480
I'm not going anywhere.

338
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,440
Sir, what are you---

339
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,800
What are you holding me for?

340
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,040
Shouchang, why are you so confused?

341
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Just go back to your hometown in Hebei for a while.

342
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,360
When will the situation here come down,

343
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,880
we'll pick you up again.

344
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,760
Sir.

345
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,480
Liu Yipin has come here with the police.

346
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
He sid to check Dean Chen's office

347
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,040
and the libraries.

348
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
Mr. Shouchang, you have to go quickly.

349
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,320
Don't panic, everyone. Calm down.

350
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,280
Let's split the work.

351
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
Haiwei, Master Ge,

352
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,360
Xiaoshan,

353
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,880
you three escort Mr. Shouchang out of town.

354
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,920
Yannian, Shiyan,

355
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,040
you go to Mr. Hu Shi

356
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
and tell him to inform the news media

357
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,320
to try every means to rescue Mr. Zhongfu.

358
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Mr. Yihan, please.

359
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,280
Please.

360
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
Write down the arrest of Mr. Zhongfu

361
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,000
in detail.

362
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,880
We should inform the Federation of Students.

363
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,160
Sir, there is no time.

364
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,960
Let's go.

365
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,680
I'm not leaving.

366
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
Let's go.

367
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,160
I won't.

368
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,640
Hurry!

369
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,104
Sir, let's go!

370
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:07,360
Go.

371
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:07,840
Okay.

372
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,400
Are you kidding?

373
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,160
A celebrity!

374
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,760
The leader of New Culture!

375
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Will he only talk in shackles and handcuffs?

376

Looks like you arranged this meeting.

386
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,280
It took a lot of effort.

387
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,240
Exactly.

388
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,080
To invite someone as important as you here,

389
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,640
I tried my best to move mountains.

390
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,720
Why should you arrest me?

391
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,840
You see.

392

I, Wu Bingxiang,

393
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,240
will never do anything you are not sure about.

394

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,680
against the government

398
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,960
by privately printing and distributing printed materials

399
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,440
and spreading radicalism.

400

401
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,560

403

to to refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

404
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,160
and severely punish the traitors,

405
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
what's the crime of this patriotic act?

406
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,880
Professor Chen,

407
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,320
I want to remind you that

408
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,400
this isn't your Peking University,

409
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,880
a forum for academic discussion.

410
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,200
Are you guilty?

411
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
You say no.

412
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
The law has the final say.

413
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
Now that you are here,

414
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,040
you have to be judged by the law.

415
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,040
But I also want to tell you,

416
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,000
you'd better make this mental preparation.

417
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,840
I'm afraid you'll have to stay here a few more days.

418
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll stay here, no problem.

419
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
What worries me is

420
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,440
how will you, Chief Wu, end up in the future?

421
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,080
You're right.

422
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
The news that you, Chen Duxiu, were arrested

423
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,240
broke today,

424
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,040
must be the headlines of major newspapers

425
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,440
in this city and even all of China.

426
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,840
What will it be like?

427
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,280
It's hard to say.

428
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,120

429
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,400
like Cao, Zhang, and Lu,

430

since I can invite you here,

433
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
I made all the preparations.

434
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,120
I will never give up halfway.

439
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,120
I should take care of you.

440
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,440
Say, what terms do you want to make here?

441
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,640
Just say it.

442
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
Then I'll be blunt.

443
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,880
Go ahead, please.

444
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,560

Of course you can.

447

You are a very important suspect in the police department.

458
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,400

Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai

479
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,600
met Xu Shichang

He solemnly proposed to them at the meeting

482
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
about the arrest of Mr. Chen Duxiu.

483
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
Mr. Sun Yat-sen said this.

484
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,960
My companions and I were very shocked.

485
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,720
Your thousand good deeds

I am right to oppose you.

488

But I don't think you dare kill him.

489
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
For killing a man,

490
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
means killing fifty,

Only the rescue activities should be combined with the refusal to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

to severely punish traitors, etc.

507

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
As for the "Weekly Review",

562
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,200
at the moment

563
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,440
it seems to have a great effect on rescuing Zhongfu.

564
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,960
It should be continued.

565
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
I agree with Mr. Lu Xun.

566
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,880
The "Weekly Review" must continue.

567
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,880
I agree with Lu Xun.

568
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,560
"New Youth" is suspended.

569
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
The "Weekly Review" can be taken over by Shizhi.

570
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
I will try my best.

571
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
In addition, Mr. Shouchang also suggested that

572
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,760
we should take advantage of the situation

573
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,520
to establish the All-China Studentsâ€™ Federation as soon as possible.

574
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,160
In schools all over the country,

575
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,160
a widespread campaign to rescue Chen Duxiu is being launched,

576
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,920
using this fuse

577
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,080
to integrate the national student forces together

578
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,320
into a unified leading body.

579
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,560
This is an excellent opportunity.

580
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,760
I propose to set up the All-China Federation of Students in Shanghai.

581
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,600
Because now it looks like

582
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,400
Shanghai has become the center of the national movement.

583
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,160
Li Dazhao.

584
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,000
Hurrah!

585
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
There is hope.

586
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,360
Students.

587
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,120
Today's "Weekly Review"

588
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,080
published a short poem

589
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,440
"Embrace Chen Duxiu".

590
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:01,204
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

591
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,880
There was a strong response among the students.

592
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,720
How about I read it to you?

593
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,520
Yes!

594
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,400
According to their claim,

595
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,640
our common people are suffering.

596
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,640
According to your opinion,

597
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,040
they are in pain.

598
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,760
They don't want pain,

599
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,200
so you're in pain.

600
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,360
Your pain

601
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
is to suffer for us.

602
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,240
Petition representatives from various provinces in Beijing

603
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,600
will then petition the Presidential Palace

604
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,120
It's been a long journey for you.

605
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
Nothing. I'm used to walking on mountain roads.

606
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,000
Yannian is just ahead.

607
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,600
Yannian!

608
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:02,880
Yannian!

609
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,480
Come, come, let me introduce

610
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,640
the President of the Shaanxi Students Federation.

611
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,400
This is Chen Yannian.

612
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:09,354
[Qu Wu]

613
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,280
Hello, hello, hello.

614
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,760
Hello, hello, hello.

615
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,720
We Shaanxi students

616
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,640
admire Mr. Chen Duxiu very much.

617
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
So I was asked to bring this pennant

618
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,360
to pay tribute.

619
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,200
Please also forward it for you.

620
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,680
Thank you very much.

621
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,960
I'm sorry for my father.

622
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,640
Students.

623
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,400
Students.

624
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,040
The day of signing the Paris Peace Treaty is coming

625
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,360
and the Beiyang government had already sent telegrams to all provinces.

626
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
Lu Zhengxiang in Paris

627
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
said that if the protest is ineffective,

628
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,640
they will just sign the peace treaty.

629
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,680
From today, Beijing and Paris will join forces

630
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,360
with petition representatives from various provinces in Beijing

631
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,960
to petition the Presidential Palace

632
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,800
and will never retreat until they see Xu Shichang.

633
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,560
There will be 30,000 Chinese in Paris

634
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,840
surrounding the Chinese envoy's residence

635
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,120
and Lu Zhengxiang's residence

636
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,720
to resolutely prevent the Chinese representatives from signing.

637
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,920
Our Beijing Federation of Students

638
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
will actively cooperate with provincial petition representatives.

639
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,120
and provide support.

640
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,680
Students' success or failure is at stake.

641
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,760
We will not stop until we achieve our goal!

642
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
We will not stop until we achieve our goal!

643
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,360
Brother Juren.

644
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:21,078
[Qian Nengxun, styled Xicheng, Premier of the Beiyang Government]

645
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,080
Forgive me. I really can't be with you.

646
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:25,529
[Xu Shichang, pen name Juren, President of the Republic of China]

647
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,212
I--

648
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,760
Look at your little promise.

649
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,920
A Chen Duxiu scared you like this?

650
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,240

652

Brother Ju Ren.

653
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,920
Then Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao,

654
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
and the student movement they lead.

655
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,520
It's a disaster.

656
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,000
They represent a trend.

657
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,560
You can't stop it at all.

658
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,880
This world is really going to change.

659
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,840
You said that, in China for thousands of years,

660
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
what scared the ruler

661
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,640
was the changing dynasties.

662
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,280
That is, the peasants uprising.

663
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,360
But now the peasants have not rebelled.

664
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,240
The-

665
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,680
The scholars rebelled.

666
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,000
It's turned upside down

667
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,160
and yields to nothing.

668
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,360
He's got no temper.

669
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
Peasants uprising is not terrible.

670
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,680
Peasants uprising do not change the course.

671
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,600
But now these people,

672
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,360
they're not only going to change the dynasty,

673
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
but change the course, change the system,

674
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,680
change the thinking.

675
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,200
Change the thinking?

676
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,360
What do you mean?

677
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,000
Ideology. Theories.

678
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
They want to transform China with foreign theories.

679
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,720
Theory?

680
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,280
What theory? This is what you say.

681
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,640
I don't know.

682
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,240
All I know is that I am behind the times.

683
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,680
It's still possible to retire from politics to protect a little face

684
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,040
and still make it to the end,

685
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
but it will be condemned in history for thousands of years.

686
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,040
Brother Juren.

687
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,160
Just give me a break.

688
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Okay, okay, okay.

689
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,520
Go then.

690
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,120
Go then.

691
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,840
Retire from politics.

692
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,120
Save your face.

693
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,520
Go then.

694
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,360
I can't walk anymore.

695
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,000

27 June 1919,

697

hundreds of representatives from petition groups in Beijing.

698

asking the Beiyang government to refuse to sign the peace treaty.

on the night of the 28th,

Xu Shichang was forced to meet with ten delegates.

Among them, Shaanxi representative Qu Wu

704
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,840
resisted to death by banging his head on the ground out of patriotic indignation.

Patriotic comrades in the academic and female circles

746
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,920
will go their own way and distract the power.

747
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,760
As a result, many students left the team.

748
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,400
I think it's a great lesson.

749
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,200
Exactly.

750
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Our female classmates were notified late.

751
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:19,630
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiangyu, editor-in-chief of the "Tianjin Student Union Newspaper"]

752
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,880
They almost blocked it back.

753
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
It's my fault.

754
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,000
I was late in notifying.

755
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,760
It's not your personal business either.

756
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
It's an organizational problem.

757
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
I have a proposal.

758
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,360
Please merge your Tianjin Federation of Students with us

759
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,000
to form a unified leading body,

760
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,440
and it can also be able to assume

761
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,160
leadership of the Tianjin patriotic youth movement?

762
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,200
What do you think?

763
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,240
This suggestion is good.

764
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,520
I agree.

765
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,720
I also agree.

766
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,840
I think

767
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,000
it is not necessary to merge the two organizations.

768
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,040
The most important

769
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,360
is to build a core team that can become the backbone

770
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,800
of the Tianjin academic community.

771
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,600
So

772
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,800
I suggest that the backbone of the Federation of Students and the Women's Comradeship Association

773
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,680
be organized

774
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,320
into a more organized patriotic group

775
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
that not only leads the student movement

776
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,280
but also conducts scientific and new ideological research.

777
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,720
and publishes a journal

778
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,920
to guide the student movement

779
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,400
to become the leading core of the Tianjin academic community.

780
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,520
I think

781
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,840
brother Enlai's proposal is very good.

782
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,040
What about me?

783
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,200
Raise your hands in agreement.

784
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,840
Thank you.

785
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,600
And sign up.

786
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,640
I also think Enlai's opinion stands higher.

787
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,600
I agree.

788
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,600
I agree. I agree, too.

789
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,280
Then Enlai,

790
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,440
let's leave the preparatory work of this organization

791
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,640
to you.

792
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,360
No problem.

793
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,960
Your Women's Patriotic Comradeship Association

794
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,560
should send someone to assist him.

795
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,160
Then, Wenshu, come.

796
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:32,880
Good.

797
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,600
Let's think of a name for this organization.

798
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,880
I guess

799
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,880
our organization will be called

800
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,080
the Awakening Society.

801
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,000
Awakening Society?

802
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,560
Yes, the Awakening Society.

803
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,360
We will go to Beijing in a few days

804
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,680
and ask Mr. Li Dazhao to give us some advice.

805
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,000
That's a good idea.

806
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Let's eat!

807
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,840
Alright!

808
00:40:58,238 --> 00:41:02,035
[HÃ´tel Lutetia, Paris]

809
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:05,842
[Gu Weiju, styled Shaochuan, Ambassador to the United States]

810
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:09,388
[Wang Zhengting, styled Rutang, Plenipotentiary of the Southern Government]

811
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,840
I read in the newspaper that

812
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,600
that the French are all impressed

813
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,800
by the Chinese these days.

814
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,720
They think

815
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,480
Chinese people are surprisingly bloodthirsty.

816
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,560
The sleeping lion was finally awakened.

817
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,880
It's not easy.

818
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,760
I heard that the Chinese have organized death squads.

819
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Three people for a minister's life.

820
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Thousands of people have signed up.

821
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,960
Qingdao is ours!

822
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,440
Qingdao is ours!

823
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,960
Shandong is ours!

824
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,320
I really want to go down

825
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,400
and tell them what I think.
