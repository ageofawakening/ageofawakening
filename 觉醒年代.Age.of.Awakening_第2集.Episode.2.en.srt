00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
I can't get it back with nine oxen.

189
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,360
The fire is good.

190
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,800
Why are you, Wang Menzou,

191
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
so stingy?

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm invited to dinner,

193
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,760
not at a restaurant, but at a home.

194
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
How much money do you save?

195
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,840
He said it! I do save money.

196
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,440
What would you like to eat?

197
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
I prepared it all yesterday.

198
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,000
The cook was also taken from Zishou's house.

199
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
I didn't spend any mony on this.

200
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,600
I can attest.

201
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,720
What Menzou said is true in every sense of the word.

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
[Chen Zishou, owner of Qunyi Book Club]
Our family cook

203
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
[Chen Zishou, owner of Qunyi Book Club]
was dragged here by him.

204
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,160
Zhong Fu, I'm borrowing the cook's skills.

205
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,760
You should also write us a couple of words.

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,000
To each his own.

207
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
He gave me a reception

208
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,160
by borrowing the cook from you.

209
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,560
He should be grateful to you.

210
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,520
What's it to do with me?

211
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,800
Me!

212
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,880
Zhong Fu, who is the stingy one?

213
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,320
Of course, he's stingy one!

214
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,720
And the famous Yadong Library

215
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,520
has always been housed in this alley.

216
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
I've tried so many times to get him to move out

217
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,000
but he won't listen!

218
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,640
It's easy to move out!

219
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,960
Wang Mengzou, I tell you,

220
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,120
we are doing great things with a bang.

221
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,120
If you want to die,

222
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,360
just cower in the alleyway.

223
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,520
If you want to live, 

224
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,600
you have to move out of the alleyway

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,480
and onto the main road.

226
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,040
All right, all right.

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,560
You're standing around talking,

228
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,360
then sit down and talk.

229
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,680
Everyone sit down.

230
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,199
Sit down, sit down.

231
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:11,684
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]
Qiaonian.

232
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:12,159
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

233
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]
You're too young to hold a grudge.

234
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,640
This is a lotus leaf and yellow beef feet dish.

235
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,120
Serve it to your father.

236
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Meet him.

237
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,720
Give him a surprise.

238
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,880
OK, I'll send him up later

239
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,840
and surprise him.

240
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,160
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]
That's right!

241
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,606
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,560
Today, everyone invited to

243
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,160
firstly

244
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
celebrate Zhong Fu's return to the country.

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,480
That's the second.

246
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,920
Since the failure of the Second Revolution,

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
We revolutionaries

248
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,640
have been scattered to the winds.

249
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,960
We went our separate ways and hid into hiding.

250
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,240
Some died, some were wounded.

251
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,000
Today, having us all here together

252
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,840
after the disaster

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,240
is not easy.

254
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,080
The situation now

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
is that European powers are at war.

256
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,040
Originally it was our country's

257
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,280
time to take a break.

258
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,597
But what about the Japanese?

259
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,969
They took advantage of the situation,

260
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:04,120
by proposing

261
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,600
the Twenty-One Demands of powers in Shandong.

262
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,160
That Yuan Shikai,

263
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,680
betrayed the country with the National Humiliation of May 9th.

264
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,560
A disgrace. It is truly a disgrace.

265
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,503
[Chen Zipei, Owner of Qunyi Book Club]

266
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,080
And now the entire country is seething,

267
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
protesting.

268
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,680
At this time, what should we do?

269
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,200
Observe with a critical eye?

270
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,400
Be docile subjects? Be a conquered people? 

271
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,760
Never.

272
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,360
Now is the time for us to fan the flames

273
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,800
add fuel to the fire.

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,120
So please let us confide in each other,

275
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,480
what thoughts we have,

276
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,880
and all express our own views.

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
Yongcheng is a military man.

278
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,240
But I think the most important thing in China today

279
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,541
is to first defeat Yuan Shikai,

280
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
then create a republic.

281
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,280
Mengzou is right.

282
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,440
The Western European powers fighting amongst themselves

283
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,840
have no time to attend to us.

284
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,193
But Yuan Shikai

285
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,880
has no time to encircle and suppress the KMT.

286
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
We need to use this opportunity

287
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,720
to mobilize the masses

288
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
forment anti-Yuan Shikai public opinion

289
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,080
and actively prepare for hostilities against him.

290
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
When the time is right

291
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,760
we will rise in rebellion

292
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,400
defeat Yuan Shikai in one fell swoop

293
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,160
and create a new republic.

294
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,000
General Zou said it well.

295
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,720
I was also inspired by Brother Zhong Fu.

296
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,800
This time

297
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,040
prepare to organize Hunan personnel in Shanghai

298
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,480
set up a national salvation newspaper

299
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,040
and mobilize anti-Yuan Shikai sentiments.

300
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
By the way, all esteemed persons present

301
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,960
please give us your advice

302
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,440
and lend your guidance.

303
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,320
For a general to organize a newspaper commends admiration.

304
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,360
My brothers have been long involved in publishing.

305
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
In the future

306
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,120
if you have any use for us

307
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
we are yours to command.

308
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,040
We will do our best to help.

309
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
Mr Zhang Shizhao has already decided

310
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,080
to return to China from Japan.

311
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,640
I, Mr. Zhang and Zhong Fu

312
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,360
as well as the magazine "The Tiger" we operated

313
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,320
will also return to Shanghai from Japan.

314
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,280
Now that this Hunan-Anhui alliance has been settled

315
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,400
I believe that

316
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,040
with the leadership of

317
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
Mr. Zhang and Zhong Fu

318
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,560
we will definitely 

319
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,720
make the newspaper a booming success.

320
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,760
Zhong Fu, don't just eat peanuts!

321
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,240
We have been waiting and waiting

322
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,000
for you to finally come back.

323
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Everyone wants to hear if you have any opinions

324
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
or new thoughts.

325
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,760
Say something.

326
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,440
Yes.

327
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,720
Right, Zhong Fu.

328
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,040
The thirteenth year of Emperor Tongzhi's reign,

329
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,400
in a discussion about naval defense, Li Hongzhang

330
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,000
termed our China to be

331
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,077
at the most critical moment in 3000 years

332
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:23,941
facing the greatest enemy in 3000 years.

333
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,320
I would like to ask everyone present

334
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,480
what they think this crisis and this enemy

335
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,640
refers to.

336
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
This... What is it?

337
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,960
Since the twelfth year of Emperor Daoguang

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,160
when Lin Zexu sold opium

339
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,800
and the British used gunboat diplomacy

340
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,360
to force open China

341
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,360
our country

342
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
has been in crisis.

343
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,200
Li Hongzhang meticulously pursued Westernization, built a navy,

344
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,280
spent decades busily self-strengthening

345
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,560
And the result?

346
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,360
The Sino-Japanese War. The country collapsed after a single fight

347
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,760
helping to achieve the aims of the Japanese empire

348
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
From then on

349
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,360
the Qing dynasty has existed only in name.

350
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
And then the Xinhai Revolution. 

351
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Sun Yatsen overthrew the imperial regime and founded a republic.

352
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,520
But what is a republic?

353
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,720
Mr. Sun Yatsen has also been seeking an answer.

354
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,440
Our compariots even less able to come to agreement

355
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
each of us with our own opinions.

356
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,400
We anti-monarchists, Republicans who have

357
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,520
gone through fire and water

358
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,320
now must return to being docile subjects of an emperor.

359
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,240
Is history playing a joke on us?

360
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,000
So today I just want to ask

361
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,233
This most critical moment in 3000 years

362
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,352
This greatest enemy in 3000 years

363
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,920
What does it really refer to?

364
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Mr. Chen's words are just so insightful.

365
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,920
Hit the nail on the head with a single sentence.

366
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,680
That's right.

367
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,080
What insight?

368
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,960
It's just banal truisms.

369
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,720
I think his glib and exaggerated ways

370
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
is just the same as before.

371
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,960
He only boasts and causes trouble

372
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
without taking any responsibility.

373
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,880
As I see it

374
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,040
the crisis is the collapse of the imperial regime

375
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,280
the powerful enemy refers to the Western Powers, right?

376
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,640
Crises - China has experienced many.

377
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,720
From Qin Shihuang to Puyi

378
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
There has been tens of dynastic changes

379
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,680
But in the end it's still

380
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,320
exchanging one autocracy for another.

381
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,560
China has also faced many strong enemies

382
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,600
Since ancient times

383
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,480
how many enemies have battled to the Central Plains?

384
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,748
And the result?

385
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,240
Not only did our China not wither away

386
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,200
but like a rolling snowball grow bigger and bigger.

387
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,520
5000 years of Chinese Civilization

388
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,800
That is the advantage left to us by our ancestors.

389
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,360
So we have the self-confidence.

390
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,880
Zhongfu, what you've spoken of is history.

391
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,000
Now is no longer the past.

392
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,760
Exactly.

393
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,480
The Opium War broke this pattern.

394
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,880
This time it is really different.

395
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
This time we are facing

396
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,160
a truly unprecedented enemy.

397
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
This great enemy

398
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,800
is not only militarily strong

399
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,920
but more importantly, strong

400
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,320
in terms of ideology and theory.

401
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,600
Not only do they have

402
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,720
advanced weaponry as a result of industrial production

403
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,680
They also have advanced ideological systems

404
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,200
as a result of capitalism.

405
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,560
Compared to them

406
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,324
our system is backwards.

407
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,065
Our thoughts are also backwards.

408
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:13,672
In short, our people are backwards.

409
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,520
For our great Chinese civilization,

410
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,160
in thousands of years, this is the first time.

411
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:18,915
Right?

412
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Therefore our conclusion is

413
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,349
in order to transform China,

414
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,680
we must first transform the minds of Chinese people

415
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,640
Improve the Suzhi of Chinese people

416
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,520
In order to recover China's former splendour

417
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
the most urgent need is

418
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,400
to bring up a new generation of people.

419
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,240
Brother Zhong Fu is right.

420
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,680
An original insight.

421
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,040
It is true that a new generation

422
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,280
is fundamental for national rejuvenation.

423
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,040
But this is too difficult.

424
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800
It can't be accomplished overnight.

425
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,800
It true. This requires a long process

426
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
that can't seek instant returns

427
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
but we also can't hesitate and dither.

428
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,160
If we have inborn talent

429
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,560
to be afraid to use it is a dereliction of duty

430
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,825
and leave a legacy of misfortune.

431
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,880
The likes of us cannot be

432
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,720
spectators looking on from the sidelines.

433
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,080
To be concerned, to take on the work.

434
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,440
Not be a turtle retracting its head into its shell.

435
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,080
That is our responsibility.

436
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,000
Well said, Zhong Fu.

437
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,560
What should we do?

438
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,360
First, theoretical basics.

439
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,080
Second, transformation of society.

440
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
Of the multitude of things

441
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,640
these two are the most important.

442
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,942
Zhong Fu,

443
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,271
there are all kinds of foreign ideologies

444
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,242
and all kinds of thinking.

445
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,200
Which one is suitable for our country?

446
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,400
Good question!

447
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,800
In terms advanced western ideologies and institutions,

448
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,680
we must be discriminating;

449
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,840
we must find the most key

450
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,640
the most universal, the most practical

451
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,920
to arm our youth.

452
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
I've been probing this question for many years

453
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,680
and have found a clear conclusion

454
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,520
which I will soon make known to the world.

455
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,040
That's why this time I've returned to China

456
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,960
to establish a magazine

457
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,840
that will serve as a rallying cry

458
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,160
for the political and ethical awakening of the nation!

459
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,920
I pledge to you all

460
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,880
that if I run the magazine for ten years

461
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,240
the whole country will change its thinking!

462
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,512
Well said! Good!

463
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,381
Good.

464
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,920
Everyone.

465
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,120
Each generation has their duty.

466
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:19,840
Our generation's duty is to

467
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,484
is to run this magazine

468
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,040
in order to identify, select and validate

469
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
one of the most advanced theories of contemporary thought

470
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
as a means of transforming China's youth

471
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,840
and transforming society

472
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,280
to explore a way to revitalise China.

473
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,341
Menzou, time to eat!

474
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,160
Yes, yes, yes. In the house, please. In the house, please. Come on.

475
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,600
Okay, let's eat. Let's eat.

476
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,320
In the house please, in the house.

477
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,120
Brother Zhong Fu.

478
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,080
What an enlightening experience!

479
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200
From now on, you will be our commander-in-chief

480
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,160
and we will listen to you.

481
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,720
Serve, serve, serve.

482
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,040
Quick, Huzi, bring the tray over here.

483
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,880
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,840
Lotus leaf hooves.

485
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,040
Come, Qiaonian.

486
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,400
This one. Bring it over to your father.

487
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,320
Okay.

488
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,960
Huzi, quick.

489
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,040
Lotus leaf hooves.

490
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,960
Quick, Huzi, bring it over.

491
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,320
The first thing I propose

492
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,680
is that we drink to the wonderful opinions

493
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
we just exchanged with one another.

494
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
Come!

495
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,480
Not bad.

496
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Fragrant.

497
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,007
Menzou,

498
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,280
just these few dishes?

499
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,680
Of course not.

500
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,320
The dishes have to be served one by one.

501
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,720
A good dish is worth the wait.

502
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,560
Don't you be worried.

503
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,160
The most substantial dish today

504
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,720
is a staple dish of my hometown Jixi, Anhui.

505
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,680
Lotus leaf hooves.

506
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Great.

507
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,840
Even in Anhui-style restaurants

508
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,240
you won't see this dish

509
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,880
because the ingredients

510
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,080
are too hard to get.

511
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,120
It's from entirely purebred

512
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,080
oxen that's three and a half years old

513
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,080
A secret recipe. Wrapped in lotus leaf. 

514
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,400
Tastes exquisite.

515
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,680
The best of Anhui cuisine.

516
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,360
One for each, today.

517
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Everyone has a share.

518
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,725
One for each!

519
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,760
Seven people, seven hooves.

520
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,764
That's two head of oxen.

521
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:37,198
Right.

522
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
That's one substantial dish.

523
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,760
What do you think, Zhong Fu? Am I stingy?

524
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Let's taste it first.

525
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,880
Come on. Lotus wrapped hooves.

526
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,360
Here it comes.

527
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,760
Quick, Qiaonian, you go first.

528
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,280
Huzi, follow.

529
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:58,246
Great!

530
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,320
Look, here it comes.

531
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,920
Qiaonian, how is it you?

532
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,680
Let me introduce everyone.

533
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,240
This is Zhongfu's second son, Qiaonian.

534
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,640
Wow. He's grown up!

535
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,480
What a talented young man.

536
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,480
A grown up boy.

537
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,240
Qiaonian, your old man has come back.

538
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Come, go see your father.

539
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
I'll have one first.

540
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
There's one for everyone.

541
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,640
Good good good.

542
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,080
One per person.

543
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,160
Come, I give to you.

544
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,120
This is a token of respect for his father.

545
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,640
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

546
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Qiaonian brought it up especially for you.

547
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,000
Grab a bite!

548
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,360
A son's filial piety to his old father.

549
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,840
Come, come, come.

550
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,000
This big yellow cow's hoof.

551
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,160
What's... what's going on here?

552
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,280
I don't know!

553
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,160
Mr. Chen, don't be angry. Mrs. Chen, don't be angry.

554
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,080
It's all my fault. My fault!

555
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680
Sister-in-law, it's not your fault.

556
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,920
Qiaonian.

557
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,920
What's going on?

558
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,440
You shouldn't be the only one who did it.

559
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,560
Where are your associates?

560
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,687
Bring him here.

561
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:18,856
Chen Yannian, come out!

562
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,360
I'm the mastermind of this.

563
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,720
Take it out on me if you're angry.

564
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,640
Yannian, how old are you?

565
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Are you still a child?

566
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,080
You are an adult!

567
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,120
How could you do such a ridiculous thing?

568
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,200
Even if you have a problem with your old man,

569
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:41,600
you can't treat him like this!

570
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,880
Do you know what you call this?

571
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,720
This is called treason!

572
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,920
This would be frowned upon in our home town!

573
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,200
Heaven condemns you!

574
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,280
Sorry, Uncle Wang, Aunt Wang.

575
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,680
I've put you in a difficult position.

576
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,080
I do this today,

577
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,520
not because of him, Chen Duxiu,

578
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,800
who didn't take enough care of my mother and us two brothers.

579
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,040
In Anqing,

580
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,520
we were not rich.

581
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,280
But at least the family has some property,

582
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,560
enough for our family to live on.

583
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,880
Since he doesn't care about us,

584
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,560
we won't beg him again.

585
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,600
We're doing this today

586
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,400
for the sake of our suffering family

587
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,480
and for

588
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,320
our cousin Chen Yongnian, who has been tortured because of him,

589
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
to teach him a lesson.

590
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,080
To speak of treason,

591
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,520
Chen Duxiu is the one who is really

592
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,280
a treacherous hypocrite.

593
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,360
Yannian, you're going too far!

594
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Don't talk about your father like that!

595
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,240
You shut up!

596
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,160
Let him speak.

597
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,480
Alright.

598
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,920
Today, in front of all my uncles and aunts,

599
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm going to reveal the shame of our Chen family.

600
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,600
Everyone please judge.

601
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,160
Last autumn,

602
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,120
after the failure of the Second Revolution in Anqing,

603
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,603
Chen Duxiu himself abandons his family and flees,

604
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:48,441
knowing the danger,

605
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,160
but still left his sick grandmother

606
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,280
and our mother and son behind.

607
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,920
Ni Xichong sent his men to raid our house.

608
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,200
My sister, Yuying, sacrificed her life to block the front hall

609
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,080
covering me and Qiaonian to jump out of the window.

610
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,920
Cousin Chen Yongnian

611
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,880
who protected his younger brother Chen Zhannian

612
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,520
was arrested for pretending to be me,

613
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,920
and was tortured to death.

614
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,920
Grandfather, who died after a long illness, was still at home

615
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Grandmother is bedridden.

616
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:16,591
The family rushed to Shanghai

617
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,167
to find Chen Duxiu,

618
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,840
asking him to return for his father's funeral.

619
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,160
But he was greedy for life and death.

620
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,160
Not only did he not go back to do his filial duty,

621
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,400
but he instead persuaded the family

622
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
to wait for a few years.

623
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,920
In the eyes of others,

624
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,360
Chen Duxiu is a great hero of righteousness.

625
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,400
But does anyone know,

626
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,840
that this is the great hero before you?

627
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,440
He lived for himself

628
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,800
and put the lives of his parents at risk.

629
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,000
That's what's so treacherous.

630
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,160
You shut up!

631
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,760
Yannian!

632
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,200
You have wronged your father by saying so!

633
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,000
After the Second Revolution,

634
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,760
Your father risked his life to persuade Gong Zhenpeng's troops in Wuhu

635
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,240
to return to Anqing to fight Yuan.

636
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,160
However,

637
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,320
this Gong Zhenpeng arrested your father.

638
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,440
The notice to be executed was posted.

639
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,680
A matter of life and death,

640
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,560
your father

641
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,280
didn't even frown!

642
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,720
It was Liu Shuya who saved him later.

643
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,720
He died in Shanghai.

644
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,480
He was the most wanted man at the time.

645
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,720
A reward of one thousand yuan was offered.

646
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,720
At that time,

647
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,160
how could he possibly go back to Anqing?

648
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,840
Yannian. Do you know

649
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,400
the people who came to Shanghai to find your father?

650
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,920
They were sent by Ni Xichong.

651
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,880
It was a trap!

652
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,520
Your father risked his life to return for a funeral

653
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,160
but we stopped him.

654
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,155
He didn't go back.

655
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,160
In those days,

656
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:49,357
he pointed to the picture of Ni Xichong every day and said

657
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,880
he wanted to eat his own flesh!

658
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,200
But what you said about your father

659
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
is not fair to him.

660
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,240
Then we were not wronged!

661
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
My grandfather, my grandmother,

662
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,240
my mother, my cousin,

663
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,360
they were not wronged!

664
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,600
Was he wronged? Was he aggrieved?

665
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,800
It's not for us to judge.

666
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Today, this matter

667
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,840
is not a prank

668
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
because he doesn't deserve to eat this dish.

669
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,480
We did this today

670
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,480
as a way to explain to the family

671
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,000
From now on, we clear our grudges,

672
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,280
not cross each other's paths,

673
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,600
and go our separate ways.

674
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,280
If you uncles and uncles feel

675
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,040
that this is a prank

676
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,840
then we apologise to everyone

677
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,040
for scaring our uncles and aunts.

678
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,200
Aunt, we are sorry for your loss.

679
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,640
We've scared you too.

680
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,200
It was not our intention.

681
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
We don't hold a grudge against you.

682
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,360
Please forgive us.

683
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,006
Yannian!

684
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:52,853
Yannian! Yannian!

685
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,080
By the way,

686
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,200
we didn't come to Shanghai to join you.

687
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
Let me put it to you this way,

688
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,560
we came

689
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,560
after we read the work-study initiative.

690
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
We decided to come to Shanghai to study French

691
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,000
and go to France to work and study.

692
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,080
We'll make our own way, 

693
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,160
don't worry about it.

694
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,840
Yannian! Qiaonian!

695
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,840
Listen to me, Yannian!

696
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,000
This... I... I... you say, you say...

697
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,040
Well, those are my sons.

698
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,080
Zhong Fu, how can you laugh at that?

699
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,040
Both sons have disowned you.

700
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,120
I, Chen Duxiu, have two such wonderful sons.

701
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,320
Why can't I laugh?

702
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,160
I didn't get to give my parents a final send-off,

703
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,120
I deserve to die for that.

704
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,440
The fact that they remembered to blame me

705
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,280
shows that they are humane people.

706
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,040
The fact that they are willing to work hard rather than rely on me

707
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,040
shows that they are self-reliant and self-sufficient people.

708
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
In such a fragile world,

709
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,200
aren't these two qualities

710
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,880
to be congratulated?

711
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,720
Zhong Fu, you haven't said a word.

712
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm still trying to figure out how to comfort you.

713
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,920
You, on the contrary, he's praising his son.

714
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,320
But what he said,

715
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,045
is a relief to us all.

716
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,927
It is.

717
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:17,840
But Zhong Fu,

718
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
I've just been watching your two boys,

719
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,520
they're not normal.

720
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,317
They will be great men in the future.

721
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:24,041
That's right!

722
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,800
These two children have high ambitions!

723
00:28:52,324 --> 00:28:53,164
Brother Mengzou.

724
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,760
Apologies to you.

725
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,161
You're not stingy

726
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,640
with your lotus leaf and yellow cow's trotters.

727
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
I accept, I accept.

728
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,400
Let's switch!

729
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,360
You're dirty. You eat this.

730
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,080
No, no, no.

731
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,360
Didn't you hear what my son said?

732
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,640
I don't deserve to eat this dish.

733
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
There are other dishes here.

734
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,560
So, so, so, let's do it!

735
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:14,140
Come on!

736
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,760
Come, come, come!

737
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,240
Please, please!

738
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,840

[Li Dazhao, styled Shou Chang, student at Waseda University]

741
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,640
In 1915,

742
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,280
the twenty-six-year-old Li Dazhao

743
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,360
wrote the article "Misanthropy and Self-awareness"

744
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,320
against Chen Duxiu's "Patriotism and Self-consciousness",

745
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,160
as challenge.

746
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,360
With a positive and optimistic attitude,

747
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,400
he urged the nation to rise

748
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,040
and join the movement against Yuan.

749
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,720
Improving the spirit of nationalism

750
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,520
and enouraging patriotism;

751
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,000
by this time, Li Dazhao

752
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,760
had become

753

755
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,600
What are you doing?

756
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,283
You scared the hell out of me.

757
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,647
Mr. Xing Yan, what brings you here?

758
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,970
Have a seat!

759
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,640
I'm going back home, just wanted to see you.

760
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
Please sit!

761
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,320
What's the matter? What's the panic?

762
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,280
Did something happen?

763
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,004
I may have recently become

764
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:00,841
a thorn in the side

765
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,519
of some Japanese students.

[Zhang Tuzhao, styled Xing Yan, revolutionary exiled to Japan]

767
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,480
They often use the pretext of supervising my classes

00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,640
to pick fights,

769
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,720
destroying my manuscripts.

770
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,360
So when I hear a knock at the door,

771
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,200
my first thought was to hide the manuscript.

772
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,480
You attend a variety of events and make a lot of appearances,

773
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,400
it is inevitable that you will be watched.

775
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
I've heard the school has a lot to say about you.

776
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,800
Japanese universities are very strict in their administration.

777
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,640
You need to be careful.

[Gan Yihao, student at Waseda University]

779

You have to find 

780
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,760
a way to make the most of both your studies and the revolution.

781
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,921
I heard you. I am organizing

782

the Chinese Students Association in Japan.

783
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,840
And I'm planning to talk to Yihan

784
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,400
to start a magazine called "Minyi" (Rule of people's will)

785
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,360
as a publication of the association.

786
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,840

the "Minyi" also opposes

788
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,240
and resists Yuan Shikai's authoritarian politics

789
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,080
by commenting and discussing the current situation,

790
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
to foster a modern civilization

791
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,160
and promote the awakening of the people.

792
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,240
It did make me miss a lot of classes,

793
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,800
but the revolutionary situation at the moment

794
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,160
is in full swing.

795
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,600
I had a really hard time choosing.

796
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,960
This is not acceptable.

797
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:06,080
In my opinion,

798
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,600
academics are also the essence of the revolution.

799
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,080
Now that you are in the door,

800
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,800
you must get your diploma.

801
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,160
Otherwise, it'll be a shame.

802
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,360
In fact, the usual is doing quite well.

out of 106 students

807
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,640
he ranked in the top 40.

808
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,320
Because he's never had a high school education

809
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,920
and went straight to undergraduate school,

810
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,880
that's a good grade, it's not bad.

811
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,920
Just third place, it's a shame.

812
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
Third place is really not bad.

813
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,520
You're good and you're willing to work hard.

814
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,120
Academics are not a problem for you.

815
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,040
Compliance with school rules is your problem.

816
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm really at a bit of a loss now.

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,280
What is more important, the revolution or school?

818
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,040
It's really hard for me to choose.

821
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,240
That means you know the difference.

 Me and Mr. Zhong Fu...

885
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:07,000
 I wrote a piece 《world-weary heart vs conscious heart》 (?)

886
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,880
To criticize his point of view

887
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,200
Help me take a look

888
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
Alright! (?)

889
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,800
In this, you are really above Zhong Fu in enthusiasm

Speak

891
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,800
First of all, I feel

892
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,920
The thing Mr. Zhong Fu is advocating...

893
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,414
To have a country, not for happiness (?)

894
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:26,043
To not have a country, not for worrying about conscious heart (?)

895
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,040
It's an argument that is pessimistic and world-weary

896
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,600
What is consciousness

897
00:33:30,643 --> 00:33:32,200
Consciousness is improving the country's spirit

898
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:35,080
Strive unremittingly to establish a new country

899
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,600
We can't, for the reason this country is not lovable, 

900
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,760
just stop loving the country

901
00:33:38,986 --> 00:33:40,040
Even more we can not, just because we

902
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,960
didn't enjoy this country's love,

903
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:43,129
we start to loathe,

904
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,700
so much so that we abandon this country

905
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,040
I approve this point of view of yours

906
00:33:49,471 --> 00:33:52,160
 but I feel this conscious heart of Zhong Fu's (?)

907
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,080
must have a deeper meaning

908
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,600
I heard right now he's not putting a foot outside

909
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,120
Shutting his head in to find China a prescription

911
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,920
this can really have him give out a 

912
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,360


913
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,320
 Actually, the debate between Mr. Zhong Fu and I

914
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,560
was also want to push him to make a move

915
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:13,760
 I really want to see his muddled interior 

916
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,680
in the end, what medicine is he selling

917
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,160


918
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,143

send it to this period's 《Jia Yin》(?)

Coming to find me, what is it for?

927
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,960
To be honest

928
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,640
I come to take refuge

Before, didn't you already find investors 

933
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:01,314
Finding is what I did

934
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,200
Before, the 300 silver dollars

935

handle procedures, rent the building, rent machines

936
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,920
and unable to have any remaining money (?)

937
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:11,360
It  You see it stray  Going opposite in this time (?)

938
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,200
 Capital proposed to remove resources (?)

939
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,640
And don't know for what reason

940
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,560
I tried my best to persuade, no results

941
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,240
With no better option, I go all over the place to find money

942
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
I scrape for gold with a thin Buddha face to search for help (?)

943
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,760
Didn't gain anything

944
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,960
Then right now how much are you short of

945
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,200


946
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,760


947
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,920
The initial number

948
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,120
added to next month's 200 silver dollars of monthly loan repayment

949
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,880
the very least is 400 silver dollars

950
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,360
　to be able to maintain until the next cycle

951
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,840
You say, my little publishing house

952
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,240
still needs allowance to supplement Jia Yin (?)

953
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,280
No matter what I do, I can't get the money

954
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,240
If next period I still can't find money

955
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,720
Afraid that your magazine will also prematurely end

956
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,400
You say, the inside of this home

calligraphy and painting and what not

959
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,840
Then at this crucial point in time

960
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,360
you can answer your worries

961
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,400

979
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,960
Listen to me talk about that

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,120
is to tell the youth

985
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,160


986
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,240
at this moment

987
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,320
should be what kind of new person (?)

988
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,240
I feel there are 6 criterion

989
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,440
The first one--

990
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,840
Stop stop

991
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,880
I don't have even the slightest doubt of your brilliant thinking

992
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,200
but we have no money, no silver

993
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,240
Your even greater brilliance, you can't put it out

994
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,000
Stop being miserable

995
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,440
Listen to me

996
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,640


997
00:36:59,560 --> 00:36:59,640


998
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,560
(?)

999
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
Right now, I really have no mood to listen

1000
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,200
Let me calm down a bit

1001
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,200
You, go write your things

1002
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,640
Write your things

1003
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,920


1004
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,760
I'll be responsible for the money situation 

1005
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,920
Be steady alright?

1006
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,240


1007
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,840
Look, right now it's 3:30

1008
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,920
At 4 O'clock, the money situation will be handled

1009
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,840


1010
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:20,920


1011
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,280
Listen to me, the 6 criterion

1012
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,520
First one

1013
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,480
independent and not a slave 

1014
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,400


1015
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,320


1016
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,840
Called showing initiative   as well as not retiring (?)

1017
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,160


1018
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,080
What is called to overcome all obstacles as well as to go forward 

1019
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,440


1020
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,360
Thus, life's duty (?)

1021
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,560
Okay I know whatever I'm going to say now

1022
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,960
it won't enter your ears 

1023
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,160
Then, you come. Help me grind ink

1024
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,680
What do you want now

1025
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:05,760


1026
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,240
I want you to grind ink, then grind ink

1027
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,040
I want to write

1028
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,960
Hurry up

1029
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,840
My characters

1030
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,280
were practiced when I was depressed in the time of my exile (?)

1031
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,320
Crooked sevens twisty eights  Looks like it's crying out a grievance

1032
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,520


1033
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:28,720


1034
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,071
So I call it bitter form

1035
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,300
Not easily taken out to show people

1036
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:35,586
But right now

1037
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,920
this brother Mengzou took a lot of trouble so far for me (?)

1038
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,440
I can't keep maintaining my personal integrity during chaotic times 

1039
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,529
I am already in a desperate situation

1040
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:50,500
yet you still have the relaxed mood to write

1041
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,560
You are thinking a way out is a way out (?)

1042
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,560
Didn't I already say

1043
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:54,680


1044
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,960
This money situation, I'll deal with it

1045
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,800


1046
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,040
Why do you still not believe me

1047
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:01,720


1048
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,080
You... don't manage the household, you don't know firewood and rice are expensive 

1049
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,960
With this talking

1050
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:11,700
I suddenly thought of 3 years ago

1051
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,640
At that time you took up post as Anhui province's Bai Wenyu's secretary-general

1052
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,640
I brought silver to meet you

1053
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:16,720


1054
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,160
to seek a hometown‘s

1055
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,800
county head commissioner's position to sit on

1056
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,720
At that time, the content of your conversation had me awaken

1057
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,000
You say at the start of this year

1058
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,280
being a government official is the most dangerous most short-lived position

1059
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,720
Saying being done for means being done for

1060
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,714
You say you have money

1061
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:34,643
Why didn't you open a publishing house at Shanghai

1062
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:34,880


1063
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:34,920


1064
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,520
Firstly... it can be because of your home

1065
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,300
Plan a smooth and steady life

1066
00:39:40,457 --> 00:39:41,557
 and another one

1067
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,360
you can collect funds for the revolution

1068
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,720
At that time, I listened to you   There's still today

1069
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,360


1070
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,280
I listened to you

1071
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:50,680


1072
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,600
Do you still remember 

1073
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,429
of course I remembered 

1074
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:55,543
Can life saving words still be forgotten?

1075
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,120
What you say is also right

1076
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,080
That year, those corrupt officials' deaths

1077
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:02,286
is an escape's escape (?)

1078
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,040
This is really similar to that book of Victor Hugo's 

1079
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,080


1080
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,560


1081
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:04,760


1082
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,960
Les Miserables 

1083
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,360
Fortunately, you awakener of Les Miserables (?)

1084
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,560


1085
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,100
still have us

1086
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:17,599
this magazine to evoke the populace to awaken 

1087
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:28,160


1088
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,760


1089
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:44,720


1090
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,240
Zhong Fu

1091
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,880


1092
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,480
Mr Zishou and Mr Zipei have arrived

1093
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,160
This way

1094
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,640
Brother Mengzou

1095
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,840
Brother Zhong Fu

1096
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:55,720
Brother Mengzou

1097
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,040
Then, you gentlemen have a chat first

1098
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,000
Yes

1099
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,920
Brother Zhong Fu

1100
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,720
Why have you thought of us brothers today

1101
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,800
Calling us over here, what instructions do you have

1102
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,560
I remember last time we had a gathering

1103
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,240
Brother said I was petty

1104
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,720
Didn't let you guys write, right?

1105
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,560
It turns out Brother Zhong Fu had us two brothers come

1106
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,200
to settle accounts from last autumn

1107
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,440
I don't dare 

1108
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,360
Today, I invite you guys over 

1109
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,640
I want to mend my image in the hearts of the two of you

1110
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,080
This is my humble writing that was just

1111
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,760
The two of you, please, have a laugh

1112
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,240
This is really too good

1113
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:31,171
Wait, wait, wait

1114
00:41:31,414 --> 00:41:32,680
It's not finished yet

1115
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,000


1116
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,920
These words of mine, I can't write them wrong (?)
