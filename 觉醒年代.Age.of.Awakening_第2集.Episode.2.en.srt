00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
I can't get it back with nine oxen.

189
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,360
The fire is good.

190
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,800
Why are you, Wang Menzou,

191
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
so stingy?

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm invited to dinner,

193
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,760
not at a restaurant, but at a home.

194
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
How much money do you save?

195
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,840
He said it! I do save money.

196
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,440
What would you like to eat?

197
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
I prepared it all yesterday.

198
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,000
The cook was also taken from Zishou's house.

199
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
I didn't spend any mony on this.

200
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,600
I can attest.

201
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,720
What Menzou said is true in every sense of the word.

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
[Chen Zishou, owner of Qunyi Book Club]
Our family cook

203
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
[Chen Zishou, owner of Qunyi Book Club]
was dragged here by him.

204
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,160
Zhong Fu, I'm borrowing the cook's skills.

205
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,760
You should also write us a couple of words.

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,000
To each his own.

207
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
He gave me a reception

208
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,160
by borrowing the cook from you.

209
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,560
He should be grateful to you.

210
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,520
What's it to do with me?

211
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,800
Me!

212
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,880
Zhong Fu, who is the stingy one?

213
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,320
Of course, he's stingy one!

214
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,720
And the famous Yadong Library

215
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,520
has always been housed in this alley.

216
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
I've tried so many times to get him to move out

217
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,000
but he won't listen!

218
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,640
It's easy to move out!

219
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,960
Wang Mengzou, I tell you,

220
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,120
we are doing great things with a bang.

221
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,120
If you want to die,

222
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,360
just cower in the alleyway.

223
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,520
If you want to live, 

224
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,600
you have to move out of the alleyway

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,480
and onto the main road.

226
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,040
All right, all right.

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,560
You're standing around talking,

228
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,360
then sit down and talk.

229
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,680
Everyone sit down.

230
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,199
Sit down, sit down.

231
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:11,684
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]
Qiaonian.

232
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:12,159
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

233
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]
You're too young to hold a grudge.

234
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,640
This is a lotus leaf and yellow beef feet dish.

235
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,120
Serve it to your father.

236
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Meet him.

237
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,720
Give him a surprise.

238
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,880
OK, I'll send him up later

239
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,840
and surprise him.

240
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,160
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]
That's right!

241
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,606
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,560
Today, everyone invited to

243
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,160
firstly

244
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
celebrate Zhong Fu's return to the country.

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,480
That's the second.

246
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,920
Since the failure of the Second Revolution,

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
We revolutionaries

248
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,640
have been scattered to the winds.

249
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,960
We went our separate ways and hid into hiding.

250
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,240
Some died, some were wounded.

251
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,000
Today, having us all here together

252
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,840
after the disaster

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,240
is not easy.

254
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,080
The situation now

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
is that European powers are at war.

256
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,040
Originally it was our country's

257
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,280
time to take a break.

258
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,597
But what about the Japanese?

259
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,969
They took advantage of the situation,

260
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:04,120
by proposing

261
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,600
the Twenty-One Demands of powers in Shandong.

262
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,160
That Yuan Shikai,

263
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,680
betrayed the country with the National Humiliation of May 9th.

264
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,560
A disgrace. It is truly a disgrace.

265
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,503
[Chen Zipei, Owner of Qunyi Book Club]

266
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,080
And now the entire country is seething,

267
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
protesting.

268
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,680
At this time, what should we do?

269
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,200
Observe with a critical eye?

270
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,400
Be docile subjects? Be a conquered people? 

271
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,760
Never.

272
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,360
Now is the time for us to fan the flames

273
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,800
add fuel to the fire.

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,120
So please let us confide in each other,

275
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,480
what thoughts we have,

276
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,880
and all express our own views.

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
Yongcheng is a military man.

278
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,240
But I think the most important thing in China today

279
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,541
is to first defeat Yuan Shikai,

280
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
then create a republic.

281
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,280
Mengzou is right.

282
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,440
The Western European powers fighting amongst themselves

283
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,840
have no time to attend to us.

284
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,193
But Yuan Shikai

285
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,880
has no time to encircle and suppress the KMT.

286
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
We need to use this opportunity

287
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,720
to mobilize the masses

288
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
forment anti-Yuan Shikai public opinion

289
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,080
and actively prepare for hostilities against him.

290
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
When the time is right

291
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,760
we will rise in rebellion

292
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,400
defeat Yuan Shikai in one fell swoop

293
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,160
and create a new republic.

294
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,000
General Zou said it well.

295
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,720
I was also inspired by Brother Zhong Fu.

296
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,800
This time

297
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,040
prepare to organize Hunan personnel in Shanghai

298
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,480
set up a national salvation newspaper

299
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,040
and mobilize anti-Yuan Shikai sentiments.

300
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
By the way, all esteemed persons present

301
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,960
please give us your advice

302
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,440
and lend your guidance.

303
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,320
For a general to organize a newspaper commends admiration.

304
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,360
My brothers have been long involved in publishing.

305
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
In the future

306
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,120
if you have any use for us

307
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
we are yours to command.

308
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,040
We will do our best to help.

309
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
Mr Zhang Shizhao has already decided

310
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,080
to return to China from Japan.

311
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,640
I, Mr. Zhang and Zhong Fu

312
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,360
as well as the magazine "The Tiger" we operated

313
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,320
will also return to Shanghai from Japan.

314
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,280
Now that this Hunan-Anhui alliance has been settled

315
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,400
I believe that

316
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,040
with the leadership of

317
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
Mr. Zhang and Zhong Fu

318
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,560
we will definitely 

319
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,720
make the newspaper a booming success.

320
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,760
Zhong Fu, don't just eat peanuts!

321
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,240
We have been waiting and waiting

322
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,000
for you to finally come back.

323
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Everyone wants to hear if you have any opinions

324
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
or new thoughts.

325
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,760
Say something.

326
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,440
Yes.

327
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,720
Right, Zhong Fu.

328
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,040
The thirteenth year of Emperor Tongzhi's reign,

329
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,400
in a discussion about naval defense, Li Hongzhang

330
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,000
termed our China to be

331
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,077
at the most critical moment in 3000 years

332
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:23,941
facing the greatest enemy in 3000 years.

333
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,320
I would like to ask everyone present

334
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,480
what they think this crisis and this enemy

335
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,640
refers to.

336
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
This... What is it?

337
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,960
Since the twelfth year of Emperor Daoguang

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,160
when Lin Zexu sold opium

339
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,800
and the British used gunboat diplomacy

340
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,360
to force open China

341
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,360
our country

342
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
has been in crisis.

343
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,200
Li Hongzhang meticulously pursued Westernization, built a navy,

344
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,280
spent decades busily self-strengthening

345
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,560
And the result?

346
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,360
The Sino-Japanese War. The country collapsed after a single fight

347
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,760
helping to achieve the aims of the Japanese empire

348
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
From then on

349
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,360
the Qing dynasty has existed only in name.

350
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
And then the Xinhai Revolution. 

351
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Sun Yatsen overthrew the imperial regime and founded a republic.

352
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,520
But what is a republic?

353
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,720
Mr. Sun Yatsen has also been seeking an answer.

354
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,440
Our compariots even less able to come to agreement

355
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
each of us with our own opinions.

356
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,400
We anti-monarchists, Republicans who have

357
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,520
gone through fire and water

358
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,320
now must return to being docile subjects of an emperor.

359
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,240
Is history playing a joke on us?

360
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,000
So today I just want to ask

361
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,233
This most critical moment in 3000 years

362
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,352
This greatest enemy in 3000 years

363
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,920
What does it really refer to?

364
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Mr. Chen's words are just so insightful.

365
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,920
Hit the nail on the head with a single sentence.

366
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,680
That's right.

367
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,080
What insight?

368
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,960
It's just banal truisms.

369
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,720
I think his glib and exaggerated ways

370
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
is just the same as before.

371
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,960
He only boasts and causes trouble

372
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
without taking any responsibility.

373
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,880
As I see it

374
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,040
the crisis is the collapse of the imperial regime

375
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,280
the powerful enemy refers to the Western Powers, right?

376
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,640
Crises - China has experienced many.

377
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,720
From Qin Shihuang to Puyi

378
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
There has been tens of dynastic changes

379
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,680
But in the end it's still

380
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,320
exchanging one autocracy for another.

381
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,560
China has also faced many strong enemies

382
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,600
Since ancient times

383
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,480
how many enemies have battled to the Central Plains?

384
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,748
And the result?

385
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,240
Not only did our China not wither away

386
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,200
but like a rolling snowball grow bigger and bigger.

387
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,520
5000 years of Chinese Civilization

388
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,800
That is the advantage left to us by our ancestors.

389
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,360
So we have the self-confidence.

390
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,880
Zhongfu, what you've spoken of is history.

391
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,000
Now is no longer the past.

392
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,760
Exactly.

393
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,480
The Opium War broke this pattern.

394
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,880
This time it is really different.

395
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
This time we are facing

396
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,160
a truly unprecedented enemy.

397
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
This great enemy

398
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,800
is not only militarily strong

399
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,920
but more importantly, strong

400
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,320
in terms of ideology and theory.

401
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,600
Not only do they have

402
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,720
advanced weaponry as a result of industrial production

403
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,680
They also have advanced ideological systems

404
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,200
as a result of capitalism.

405
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,560
Compared to them

406
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,324
our system is backwards.

407
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,065
Our thoughts are also backwards.

408
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:13,672
In short, our people are backwards.

409
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,520
For our great Chinese civilization,

410
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,160
in thousands of years, this is the first time.

411
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:18,915
Right?

412
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Therefore our conclusion is

413
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,349
in order to transform China,

414
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,680
we must first transform the minds of Chinese people

415
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,640
Improve the Suzhi of Chinese people

416
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,520
In order to recover China's former splendour

417
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
the most urgent need is

418
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,400
to bring up a new generation of people.

419
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,240
Brother Zhong Fu is right.

420
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,680
An original insight.

421
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,040
It is true that a new generation

422
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,280
is fundamental for national rejuvenation.

423
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,040
But this is too difficult.

424
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800
It can't be accomplished overnight.

425
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,800
It true. This requires a long process

426
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
that can't seek instant returns

427
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
but we also can't hesitate and dither.

428
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,160
If we have inborn talent

429
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,560
to be afraid to use it is a dereliction of duty

430
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,825
and leave a legacy of misfortune.

431
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,880
The likes of us cannot be

432
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,720
spectators looking on from the sidelines.

433
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,080
To be concerned, to take on the work.

434
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,440
Not be a turtle retracting its head into its shell.

435
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,080
That is our responsibility.

436
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,000
Well said, Zhong Fu.

437
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,560
What should we do?

438
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,360
First, theoretical basics.

439
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,080
Second, transformation of society.

440
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
Of the multitude of things

441
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,640
these two are the most important.

442
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,942
Zhong Fu,

443
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,271
there are all kinds of foreign ideologies

444
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,242
and all kinds of thinking.

445
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,200
Which one is suitable for our country?

446
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,400
Good question!

447
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,800
In terms advanced western ideologies and institutions,

448
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,680
we must be discriminating;

449
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,840
we must find the most key

450
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,640
the most universal, the most practical

451
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,920
to arm our youth.

452
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
I've been probing this question for many years

453
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,680
and have found a clear conclusion

454
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,520
which I will soon make known to the world.

455
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,040
That's why this time I've returned to China

456
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,960
to establish a magazine

457
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,840
that will serve as a rallying cry

458
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,160
for the political and ethical awakening of the nation!

459
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,920
I pledge to you all

460
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,880
that if I run the magazine for ten years

461
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,240
the whole country will change its thinking!

462
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,512
Well said! Good!

463
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,381
Good.

464
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,920
Everyone.

465
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,120
Each generation has their duty.

466
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:19,840
Our generation's duty is to

467
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,484
is to run this magazine

468
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,040
in order to identify, select and validate

469
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
one of the most advanced theories of contemporary thought

470
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
as a means of transforming China's youth

471
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,840
and transforming society

472
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,280
to explore a way to revitalise China.

473
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,341
Menzou, time to eat!

474
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,160
Yes, yes, yes. In the house, please. In the house, please. Come on.

475
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,600
Okay, let's eat. Let's eat.

476
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,320
In the house please, in the house.

477
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,120
Brother Zhong Fu.

478
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,080
What an enlightening experience!

479
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200
From now on, you will be our commander-in-chief

480
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,160
and we will listen to you.

481
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,720
Serve, serve, serve.

482
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,040
Quick, Huzi, bring the tray over here.

483
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,880
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,840
Lotus leaf hooves.

485
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,040
Come, Qiaonian.

486
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,400
This one. Bring it over to your father.

487
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,320
Okay.

488
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,960
Huzi, quick.

489
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,040
Lotus leaf hooves.

490
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,960
Quick, Huzi, bring it over.

491
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,320
The first thing I propose

492
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,680
is that we drink to the wonderful opinions

493
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
we just exchanged with one another.

494
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
Come!

495
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,480
Not bad.

496
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Fragrant.

497
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,007
Menzou,

498
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,280
just these few dishes?

499
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,680
Of course not.

500
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,320
The dishes have to be served one by one.

501
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,720
A good dish is worth the wait.

502
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,560
Don't you be worried.

503
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,160
The most substantial dish today

504
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,720
is a staple dish of my hometown Jixi, Anhui.

505
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,680
Lotus leaf hooves.

506
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Great.

507
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,840
Even in Anhui-style restaurants

508
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,240
you won't see this dish

509
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,880
because the ingredients

510
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,080
are too hard to get.

511
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,120
It's from entirely purebred

512
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,080
oxen that's three and a half years old

513
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,080
A secret recipe. Wrapped in lotus leaf. 

514
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,400
Tastes exquisite.

515
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,680
The best of Anhui cuisine.

516
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,360
One for each, today.

517
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Everyone has a share.

518
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,725
One for each!

519
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,760
Seven people, seven hooves.

520
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,764
That's two head of oxen.

521
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:37,198
Right.

522
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
That's one substantial dish.

523
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,760
What do you think, Zhong Fu? Am I stingy?

524
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Let's taste it first.

525
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,880
Come on. Lotus wrapped hooves.

526
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,360
Here it comes.

527
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,760
Quick, Qiaonian, you go first.

528
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,280
Huzi, follow.

529
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:58,246
Great!

530
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,320
Look, here it comes.

531
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,920
Qiaonian, how is it you?

532
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,680
Let me introduce everyone.

533
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,240
This is Zhongfu's second son, Qiaonian.

534
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,640
Wow. He's grown up!

535
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,480
What a talented young man.

536
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,480
A grown up boy.

537
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,240
Qiaonian, your old man has come back.

538
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Come, go see your father.

539
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
I'll have one first.

540
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
There's one for everyone.

541
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,640
Good good good.

542
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,080


543
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,160


544
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,120


545
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,640


546
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640


547
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,000


548
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,360


549
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,840


550
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,000


551
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,160


552
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,280


553
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,160


554
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,080


555
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680


556
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,920


557
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,920


558
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,440


559
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,560
