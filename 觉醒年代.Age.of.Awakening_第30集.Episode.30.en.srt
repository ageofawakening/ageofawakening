00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:07,085
[Episode Thirty]

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,000
Yannian. Qiaonian.

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,360
I need you two for a mission.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,040
I just wrote an article.

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,600
The title is

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
"Inform all people about the Shandong issue"

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,120
This article is written for the general strike tomorrow.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,640
It aims to warn everyone out there.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
Don't think the Shandong issue

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,640
is just a matter of the survival of one province.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
It's not just a matter for academics.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,320
It is an incoming danger for the whole China.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,600
Whoever you are, academics, politicians or businessmen

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,040
farmers, labors, police or soldiers

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
bureaucratics, congressman or journalist

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,680


18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,880
All of you have to come forward.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,080
This arrow of the national movement should point at

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,360
the traitorous government

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,360
It shall not be like May 4th.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,160
Cao Rulin Zhang, Zongxiang and Lu Zongyu

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,440
Those traitors is not the sole target.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,960
To make sure everyone sees this

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,160
tomorrow during the protest.

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,880
We must print it out today.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,000
You okay doing this?

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,880
Sure.

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
Okay, go to the Red House Library of Peking University.

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,480
Ask Shouchang to get mimeograph and paper.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,440
We'll print it right here

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:36,320
Cherish our nation, protect our country.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,040


34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,540
Please take a look.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560


36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,840
This is my year 1919.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
My 1919

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,480
It's also every Chinese's year 1919.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,480
And the peace between North and South is broken.

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,280
Us students...

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
We shall never sign this treaty.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
But now the Japanese comes, claims they have the power.

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,240
They want to be our master.

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
This letter in my hand

45
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,720
It's a declaration to our President Xu Shichang.

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,560
Can we let it happen?

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
No, no, no

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
Please support our declaration.

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
Support us

50
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:21,760


51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:21,840


52
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,480
Why are we launching this student movement?

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
Punish the traitors!

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
Simply changing the signboard from old Qing times

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
to a new one written in China gate is not enough.

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,520
Such revolution is not complete and thorough.

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,520
Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang and Lu Zongyu

58
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
these three owe their lives to us people.

59
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,120
Bring Cai Yuanpei back.

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,560
Cherish our nation, protect our country.

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,200
Love China and defend the motherland.

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
My fellow worker friends.

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,240
Today, I want to tell you about

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
the Paris Peace Treaty.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,600
Back in the Qing Dynasty, our Qingdao was occupied.

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,600
The Germans took it by force.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,320
Now, Germany was defeated this world war. 

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,240
We are one of the victorious countries.

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
Before, we couldn't fight back Germany's gunfire.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
We had no choice but to let them took Qingdao.

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
But now

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
We defeated Germany.

73
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Qingdao should be returned to us. 

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
This is a matter of course, right?

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
right

76
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,480
right

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:34,640


78
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
right

79
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,480
right

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:36,720
right

81
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:36,880


82
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
good

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,920
But, Japan came out.

84
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,880
They say that

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
Our government of the Republic of China wanted to borrow money from Japan. 

86
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,600
So they agreed that

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
The administration of Qingdao would be handed over to Japan.

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
America, France and UK on the Paris Peace Conference

89
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,760


90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,960
They dare not provoke Japan, so they went along with it.

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,080
Friends, if that's the case,

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,520
this country, as a victorious country,

93
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
not only did we not have any gain from our victory,

94
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,840
instead of Qingdao's return,

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,160
we are losing it to Japan.

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
I'd like you to think it over.

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,760
This is our business.

98
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
However,

99
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,360
We Chinese people can't make decisions by ourselves.

100
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,000
Instead, those foreigners somehow has that power.

101
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
Is this axiom?

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,000
Defend China's sovereignty to death!

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,480
Even more exasperating is that

104
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,200
our government actually agreed on

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,760
such a treaty deeply disgraces our country.

106
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440
The government agreed to sign it!

107
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,640
My fellow worker friends, this country is called the Republic of China. 

108
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
What is the Republic of China? 

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
It means the people's country.

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,320
I'd like to ask you, is there any important issue

111
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
where our opinions are valued?

112
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,680
We, the working class.

113
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,800
Bleeding, sweating and working hard every day.

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,520
Created so much wealth for the country.

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
I want to ask everyone

116
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,640
Have you been consulted on important state affairs?

117
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no.

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
Since the founding of the Republic of China

119
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,640
so many ridiculous things have happened.

120
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,000
What's the one thing that makes you masters of your own affairs? 

121
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
No.

122
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,640
We're just a bunch of coolies.

123
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
Be looked down upon

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
We don't even get enough food.

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
We are not our own masters.

126
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
No, no

127
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,640
Why are the students taking it to the streets?

128
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,760
They are boycotting this shameless peace treaty.

129
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
They are defending China's sovereignty.

130
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,720
They are exercising their rights,

131
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
the rights as a Chinese citizen to have a say in this country.

132
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
Workers

133
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
We are all people with a patriotic heart.

134
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,920
China is our Chinese's China.

135
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Our own country

136
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,920
Who else than us would love and cherish it?

137
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
right

138
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,840
right

139
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,720
So,

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
We can't just stand by and watch

141
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160
this patriotic act of the students.

142
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,920
We can't ignore it.

143
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,320
Pledge to defend China's sovereignty!

144
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,320
Defend China's sovereignty to death!

145
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,040
Pledge to defend China's sovereignty!

146
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,360
Shandong issue is not only the survival of a province.

147
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
It's a national problem.

148
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
Whoever you are, academics or politicians,

149
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
Merchants, laborers, farmers, police

150
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,120
A member of parliament or a soldier,

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
or journalists , everyone has to come forward. 

152
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,360
If we don't,

153
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,960
who will stand up and help us?

154
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
China is my China.

155
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
It's also your China.

156
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,440
China

157
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
is Chinese's China.

158
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,240
Students.

159
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,760
I want to say a few words.

160
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,080
good

161
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,240
Fellow citizens

162
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,480
I am Shen Deling, I work in a textile company.

163
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,960
I am the director of the office manages monopoly right of our Spinning Jenny machine.

164
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
Students' patriotic enthusiasm

165
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,240
touched me deeply.

166
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
Now I'm willing to give what I hold in my hand to the public,

167
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,600
the exclusive right of spinning machine is open to everyone.

168
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,200
So that our country's strength is empowered.

169
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,920
Bravo!

170
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,080


171
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah!

172
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,000
Make the way.

173
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,280
Go away.

174
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,000
What are you doing!

175
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,240


176
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,720
What are you doing

177
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:28,880


178
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,040


179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,120


180
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,200


181
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,240
Stop!

182
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,440


183
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
You all stop!

184
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,400


185
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
What you're wearing on your heads

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
Isn't it a Chinese hat?

187
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,800
The soil you stepped on right now.

188
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
Isn't it Chinese land?

189
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
What you eat, drink, wear and use. 

190
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
Which one is not the blood and sweat of the people?

191
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
Why when we are making speech for everyone,

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,040
you guys?

193
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
You are pushing us away for the enemy.

194
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
You might be wearing police caps.

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
But you are merely idiots holding a police sticks now, wake up!

196
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,640
Even if you don't care for the country's survival

197
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
can't you think it over just for the sake of you and your family?

198
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,080
Think about it.

199
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
We students come forward calling for justice.

200
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,440
What did we do wrong?

201
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,800
We did nothing wrong.

202
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160
What did we do wrong?

203
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,760
Take Shandong Qingdao back!

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,920
Take Shandong Qingdao back!

205
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
Take Shandong Qingdao back!

206
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,080
Take Shandong Qingdao back!

207
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,520
Release the arrested students!

208
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,120
Release the arrested students!

209
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,240
Release the arrested students!

210
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:30,960


211
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,200


212
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,360
Punish the traitors!

213
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,320
Punish the traitors!

214
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,360
Punish the traitors!

215
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,440


216
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,400
Punish the traitors!

217
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,760
Punish the traitors!

218
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,680
Punish the traitors!

219
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,280
Teachers, students.

220
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,520
Today, we Xinmin Association

221
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
gathered representatives from more than 20 schools in Changsha here.

222
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,120


223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
We would like to call for

224
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,120
our support of Beijing's May 4th Movement together.

225
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
Urge the government to boycott the Paris Peace Treaty

226
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,280
This ..

227
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,280
Is the head of Peking University Student Union.

228
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,320
Mr. Deng Zhongxia.

229
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,320
He was entrusted by Mr. Chen Duxiu

230
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
and Mr. Li Dazhao

231
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,840
to come to Changsha for support.

232
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,680
Next, he will tell us

233
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
about the situation in Beijing.

234
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,120
Good

235
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,080
Teachers!

236
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,840
Fellow students

237
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,280
My name is Deng Zhongxia.

238
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,040
Being here today

239
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,080
seeing everyone

240
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
I feel really nostalgic.

241
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,960
Because 

242
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,280
I am a native of Hunan.

243
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
So today

244
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,560
I'm home.

245
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,520
Welcome home!

246
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,680
I want to thank the Xinmin Association led by Mao Zedong.

247
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,640
Thank you all

248
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
for your support towards the Beijing Federation of Students

249
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,080
and the support of Peking University Student Union. 

250
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,960
thank you

251
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,640
The current situation in Beijing

252
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,080
is very exhilarating.

253
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,200
But at the same time

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,480
also full of crisis.

255
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,400
Now the people in Beijing 

256
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,160
and the Beiyang government

257
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
is in the middle of a fierce confrontation.

258
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,760
What we should do now

259
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,800
is to stick to it. 

260
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,360
We should mobilize the efforts of the whole nation.

261
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
We should team up with every Chinese.

262
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
And keep fighting to the end. 

263
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
Us Beijing Federation of Students

264
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,160
and Peking University Student Union

265
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,560
have organized more than twenty rally groups. 

266
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
They will go to all provinces and cities in the country to preach.

267
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,960
I came to Changsha, Hunan.

268
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,400
I'd like to invite all of you

269
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,600
My brothers

270
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,800
My classmates

271
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
My brothers and sisters.

272
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
Please join this fight with us.

273
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
Join this patriotic movement throughout the whole nation.

274
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
To save us,

275
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,520
to save our motherland on the verge of collapse.

276
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,240
Okay, okay, okay.

277
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,920
Zhongxie.

278
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,160


279
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,360
I want to know.

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,280
What is this campaign aiming to achieve?

281
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,760
Is there a specific goal?

282
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
To urge the government to refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty.

283
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,400
To never give Qingdao to Japan.

284
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
What we have to do now

285
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,000
is to awaken the whole nation.

286
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
We want to transform the whole society.

287
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,720
We want to make it happen that

288
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
the working class become the master of the country.

289
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
Great.

290
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,640
Good point!

291
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,280
Students.

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,600
I brought you something. 

293
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,120
These are the <Weekly Review> established by

294
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,560
Mr. Chen Duxiu and Mr. Li Dazhao.

295
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,560
You can learn more about the latest situation in Beijing

296
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,920
and our lateset ideas

297
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,280
from this paper.

298
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,160
Students,

299
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
please send this out.

300
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,080
come

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,240


302
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,560
Pass it around to each other.

303
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
Pass it around, everybody.

304
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
You can use this Weekly Review

305
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
to learn about the latest situation in Beijing.

306
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,440
Look, this is the paper from Beijing.

307
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,280
How can Shandong be given to the Japanese?

308
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,080
We must fight to the end. Yeah

309
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,880
classmates

310
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,400
classmates

311
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,160
Everyone saw it.

312
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,600
Mr. Chen Duxiu's slogan

313
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
All people stand up 

314
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,400
to solve the problem directly.

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,200
We Hunan

316
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,560
Can't fall behind.

317
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,280
So,

318
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
on behalf of Xinmin Association, I propose

319
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,280
to set up Hunan Students Federation fast.

320
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
Launch a general strike of students in the whole province.

321
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,320
At the same time,

322
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,920
contact all parties in Hunan urgently. 

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
Establish Hunan Federation of all walks of life

324
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
Achieve the great unity of the people

325
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,240
Good

326
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,160
I support the strike.

327
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
Runzhi

328
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,000
Us Hunan Commercial College

329
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,280
supports students to strike

330
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,200
But due to the lack of experience.

331
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:43,920
I suggest

332
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,040
that Xinmin Association should take the lead

333
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,520
on this people's grand coalition in the whole province.

334
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,560
You will take the responsibility.

335
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,440
With no hesitations.

336
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,280
For better guidance

337
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,640
of Hunan's patriotic movement

338
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,280
I suggest

339
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
that we should follow Beijing's example.

340
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
Hunan Federation of Students should also

341
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,080
run a magazine.

342
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
It's called

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
<Xiangjiang Review>

344
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,080
Good!

345
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,120
This is good.

346
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,760
just right

347
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
An echo of Beijing's Weekly Review.

348
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,640
Echo each other

349
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,280
Runzhi

350
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,560
That's a great idea.

351
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
Our May 4th Movement in Beijing was guided

352
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,200
by the Weekly Review.

353
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,160


354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,960
Mr. Zhongfu will publish several articles in each issue.

355
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,400
He is our commander in chief.

356
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
I think Xiangjiang Review

357
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
Should also play such a role. 

358
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:20,800
Right

359
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
As for the editor-in-chief

360
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,400
Runzhi

361
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,560


362
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,760
None but you

363
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Fellow students

364
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,600
Mao Zedong is member of Journalism Research Association

365
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
in Peking University.

366
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,240
I suggest

367
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,760
for the editor-in-chief of Xiangjiang Review

368
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
he should be the one.

369
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,920
Agree?

370
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
Agree

371
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,120


372
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,480
Agree

373
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:40,880
Agree

374
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,680
Okay, okay, okay.

375
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,560
Classmates

376
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,320
I must

377
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,080
successfully fulfil this mission. 

378
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,800
good

379
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,600
good

380
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:22,800
come

381
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,120
come

382
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,480
Come to the meeting.

383
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:25,840
come

384
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,280
Come, come, have a meeting.

385
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,520
Have a seat please.

386
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes

387
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,320


388
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,520
Time for a meeting.

389
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,400


390
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:34,640


391
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,960
Fellow students

392
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
I'd like to introduce two people to you.

393
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,280
This is Zhao Shiyan. 

394
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,960


395
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
He is the representative of Beijing Federation of Students.

396
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,880
Entrusted by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao

397
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,800
Come to our Federation for support.

398
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,400
This is Zhou Enlai.

399
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,640
Zhou Enlai just returned from studying in Japan.

400
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,080
He is the editor-of-chief

401
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,080
of Tianjin Student Union Newspaper we are about to establish.

402
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,880
Now

403
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
Let's have Zhao Shitan

404
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
tell us about the situation in Beijing.

405
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
Beijing and Tianjin are as close as lips and teeth

406
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
The situation in Beijing is very urgent now.

407
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,520
We need support from all over the country.

408
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Before the end of the month, the Beijing Federation of Students will organize 

409
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,440
large-scale demonstrations and petitions.

410
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
I hope all major cities in the country 

411
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,080
join us.

412
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,960
Firstly,

413
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,560
to demonstrate all Chinese students' determination

414
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,560
in this patriotic movement. 

415
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,120
Secondly, to prepare for the establishment of the National Federation of Students.

416
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,920
This is also the purpose and mission of my visit here to Tianjin.

417
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
I brought some

418
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
latest <Weekly Review>.

419
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,080
From it you can read about

420
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
the current situation in Beijing and our ideas.

421
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,400
Fellow students

422
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
The Students Federation and our Women's Patriotic Association. 

423
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,920


424
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,840
have made arrangements for organizing petitions

425
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,880
in Beijing.

426
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,400
Next, Deng Wenshu please.

427
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,440
An introduction.

428
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,120
The Tianjin delegation going for the petitions in Beijing this time

429
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,040
will be led by Ma Jun and Liu Qingyang.

430
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,400
All schools in Tianjin

431
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,840
will send representatives to attend.

432
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,800
To express

433
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,920
our determination to fight till the end

434
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,240
together with Beijing academic circles

435
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,800
Our academic circles in Tianjin havs drafted an affidavit.

436
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
There are six articles altogether.

437
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,960
First, pledge to guard the motherland.

438
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,440


439
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,520
Second, pledge to protect the sovereignty.

440
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,120
Third, pledge to wipe off national humiliation.

441
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
Fourth, pledge to rid the country of traitors.

442
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,960
Fifth, pledge to face danger together.

443
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Sixth, pledge to always stand side by side.

444
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,280
Any opinion is welcome.

445
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,760
Fellow students

446
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,440
For better guidance

447
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,960
our student movement in Tianjin.

448
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,080
We decided

449
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,160
to follow Peking University's Weekly Review

450
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,080
Establish Tianjin Student Union Newspaper.

451
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,840
Given the fact that Zhou Enlai

452
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
has established <School Spirit> and <Dedication>

453
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
in Nankai before.

454
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,960
He has rich experience in running journals.

455
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Through joint decision

456
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,600
we hired Zhou Enlai

457
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,720
as our editor in chief.

458
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,680
This is a difficult and bitter job.

459
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,200
Comrade Enlai has been worked on this by himself

460
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,240
for more than half a month.

461
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
The preparatory work for the Union Newspaper has been completed. 

462
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,040
Now

463
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,880
Let's invite Zhou Enlai. 

464
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,880
Give a brief introduction.

465
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,840
Fellow students

466
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,040
Soon after I came back

467
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,560
The May 4th Movement took place.

468
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,160
I am entrusted with an important task by the Student Federation.

469
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Being editor-in-chief of Student Union Newspaper, 

470
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,640
to me,

471
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,320
is an unshirkable responsibility.

472
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,560
Based on <New Youth> <Weekly Review> <The Renaissance>

473
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,720
and other papers in Beijing,

474
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,600


475
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,480
We made the preliminary draft

476
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,480


477
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,480
focusing on advocating ideas and commenting on current politics.

478
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,160
We set up eight columns

479
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
including New Trend and New Idea

480
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,600
We also have 20 codes for running this paper.

481
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
Mainly can be expressed in two sentences.

482
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
All proposals being released are based on the spirit of democracy.

483
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
With the spirit of innovation for both our heart and mind as the main theme.

484
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
We publicize new thoughts,

485
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,720
report and comment on current affairs both domestic and abroad.

486
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,240
and the national student movement.

487
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
We will put forward the slogan for the grand scheme accordingly

488
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,400
as the situation in Tianjin and the whole country keeps envolving.

489
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,400
To guide the broad masses of revolutionary youth

490
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,920
to fight against imperialism and warlords.

491
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,200
Chief editor Zhou

492
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,800
Can you tell us about 

493
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,320
The difference between innovation for heart and for mind?

494
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,680
Sure.

495
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,440
In brief,

496
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,400
Innovation for our minds

497
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
is to transform society.

498
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,760
Innovation for our hearts

499
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
is to transform our own ideology.

500
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,040
The latter one is the premise and foundation of the former one.

501
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
Innovation is revolutionary.

502
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm going to write an inaugural article for the paper

503
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,360
discussing these two innovations.

504
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,920
To call on the patriotic youth to consciously

505
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,280
combine transformation of one's own thoughts 

506
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,040
and of the whole society.

507
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,600
Arm our spirits with the weapon of new trend and new thoughts

508
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,120
all round the world.

509
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
And to bring the people's consciousness back.

510
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,960
Unite people with such aspirations

511
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
and achieve the fundamental transformation of Chinese society.

512
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
Pledge to guard the motherland.

513
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:54,720


514
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:54,880


515
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:54,960


516
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,360


517
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,440


518
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,600


519
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,200
Pledge to protect the sovereignty.

520
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,840
Pledge to wipe off national humiliation.

521
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,480
Pledge to rid the country of traitors.

522
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,280
Pledge to face danger together.

523
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,080


524
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,160


525
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,240


526
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,400


527
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,480


528
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:06,560


529
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,880
Pledge to always stand side by side.

530
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:06,640


531
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:06,720


532
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:06,800


533
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,000


534
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,440
Zhou Enlai is here.

535
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,520
Students, according to reliable information

536
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Nankai, in exchange for donation funds,

537
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
has secretly arranged a deal with the traitor Cao Rulin. 

538
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,720


539
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
They want to hire Cao Rulin as a board member of Nankai University.

540
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,120
This is a utter disgrace to Nankai Univeristy.

541
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,600
I propose, to defend the honor of Nankai

542
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,760
We're going to raise a strong protest now.

543
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880


544
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,640
We can never let the shameless traitor Cao Rulin

545
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,240
stained the glory of Nankai.

546
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,440
Yes.

547
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,520
Students, come with me.

548
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,080


549
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,800
Go

550
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,360


551
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,440


552
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,240


553
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,600
Pledge to guard the motherland.

554
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,600


555
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:39,840


556
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,120


557
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,640
Pledge to protect the sovereignty.

558
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000


559
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,440
Pledge to wipe off national humiliation.

560
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,440


561
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,720
Pledge to rid the country of traitors.

562
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,800
Gentlemen

563
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,800
I was entrusted by the President,

564
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
to host this meeting on his behalf.

565
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,440
Chen Lu reported yesterday that

566
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,040
Japanese Ambassador Obada

567
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
made a strong protest to us.

568
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,360
He demanded us to treat students

569
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,040
in a way more courageous and dominant.

570
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,920
This morning

571
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
The president spoke to Duan Qirui on the phone.

572
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Said that students in Tsinghua University and some other schools.

573
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,880
Instead of attending classes, they now practice martial arts.

574
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,840
It's having a very bad influence.

575
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
This month only, we have held more than a dozen meetings

576
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
regarding the student issue.

577
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,360
Director Wu

578
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
Please update everyone on the situation.

579
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,760
My friends, it's getting worse and worse.

580
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,080
It's not just students now.

581
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,800
All walks of life are involved to certain extents.

582
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,160
It's also not just Beijing.

583
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
All the major cities in the country are making a fuss. 

584
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
This kind of involvement of the whole society.

585
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,800
It is unprecedented. 

586
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,920
Merchants and laborers in Beijing are also onto something,

587
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
there is a tendency they will join hands with students.

588
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,520
In the May 4th Movement,

589
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,560
students only proposed to severely punish the traitors.

590
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,760
But now,

591
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,800


592
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
they are aiming at the government directly.

593
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,080
If we don't take tough actions

594
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,520
now

595
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,920
This chaotic situation will surely start a prairie fire.

596
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,440
Spread rapidly throughout China.

597
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Director Wu

598
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,160
According to you.

599
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
The student movement has already spread all over the country .

600
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
What tough measures are you going to take?

601
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Toughness means that students can't be doing whatever they want.

602
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,800
Arrest when needed and sentence when needed.

603
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
Resolutely perform the functions of the government.

604
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
I don't agree.

605
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,840
I think the root of this mess

606
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,920
is the dismissal of Cai Yuanpei.

607
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
If we find a way

608
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
to bring Cai Yuanpei back,

609
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
have the students of Peking University managed by Cai Yuanpei,

610
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,720
it'll be much better than using force.

611
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,200
Besides, the cost and loss are much smaller.

612
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,640
You are only focusing on one end.

613
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,840
You should know that

614
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,960
those professors 

615
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,280
the ones advocating the new culture movement around Cai Yuanpei. 

616
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,160
They are the behind-the-scenes commander of this mess.

617
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,960
Ask them to help ease the situattion is a ridiculous move.

618
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
Nonsense, you might as well daydreaming.

619
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,920
What did you say, nonsense? 

620
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,480
Is that your attitude?

621
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,680
Yes, you have a problem?

622
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,000
Every one.

623
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
Shut up

624
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
What do you want?

625
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,040
Student movement is no small matter. 

626
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,600
General Duan and the President had a long call in the morning.

627
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
They have given due thoughts about this.

628
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,800
And they decided to take tough actions first.

629
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
Director Wu, you strengthen the police force.

630
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,200
Chief Li

631
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,240
Your gendarmes strengthen the law enforcement patrols.

632
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,400
We are the Republic of China.

633
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,240
There rules and regulations we need to follow.

634
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,800
Students should not be allowed to disturb public order. 

635
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,440
We also can't let foreigners, especially Japanese,

636
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
to mock us that we have no ability to govern.

637
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,680
Ministry of Education and other functional departments.

638
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,240
Be firm on both daily operations and public statement clearly.

639
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,440
We should perform our duties firmly.

640
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,840
A presidential decree will be issued tomorrow morning. 

641
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
The capital city is the crucial place. 

642
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
Assemblies, parades and speeches are strictly prohibited.

643
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Spreading leaflets and other social agitation.

644
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,640
will be strictly inspected by civil and military officers.

645
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,800
If any of the precedent circumstances occurs again, 

646
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
do everything you can to stop it.

647
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
For those who refuse to obey,

648
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,480
countermeasures shall be made according to law to ease chaos.

649
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
The president also said

650
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,920
we can't be all tough and strict.

651
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
We can't push too hard.

652
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,680
The general principle to solve this mess is four words,

653
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
tough but also gentle.

654
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,920
Which we need to have further discussion about.

655
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
As for implementation,

656
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
I don't need to instruct you as you all know how to play it tough.

657
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,520
Just submit your plan.

658
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,080
But there must be a limit of hardness.

659
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,280
Where should we draw the line?

660
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
Can I arrest people?

661
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm only talking about principles.

662
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,680
It's your business on how to carry out.

663
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
You're slick.

664
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,960
That's crime of omission.

665
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,880
Director Wu

666
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,920
If you can really send me to prison now

667
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,800
to aviod all these,

668
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,200
I will thank you from the bottom of my heart.

669
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,640
What do you mean?

670
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,800
Come on, don't bicker.

671
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,600
The president's order is clear.

672
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
Arrest and punishment when needed.

673
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
Your Ministry of Education has to be tough too.

674
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
We can't be all tough.

675
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,440
If that's the case,

676
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
it won't be the carrot and stick.

677
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
Then what's there to discuss about?

678
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,040
You can be gentle, I will not.

679
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
I can't do it alone.

680
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,520
It depends on everyone's cooperation.

681
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
Do you have any good ideas?

682
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,880
Three

683
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,160
First, all schools have an early holiday. 

684
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Second, announce the higher-rank civil service examination.

685
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,640
Third, have spies

686
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
merge into the student groups,

687
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
and to break their organization from inside.

688
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,480
See.

689
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,800
Don't we have the gentle approach now?

690
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,600
I say we adopt what mayor just said.

691
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,240
The first two shall be implemented by the Ministry of Education. 

692
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,280
The third one,

693
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
Director Wu is in charge.

694
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,240
good

695
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Don't you have many spies under your command? 

696
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,760
Spend money when you should.

697
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,160
Spend some money, have spies work.

698
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,920
You are gonna give me the funds?

699
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,880
Dismiss.

700
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,080


701
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,160
Instruction of Ministry of Education

702
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,160


703
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,920
All principals of each school shall work with the staff,

704
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,960
supervise all students to attend classes within three days.

705
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Violators will be dismissed.

706
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,320
What's the situation? Dismissal

707
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
It seems that since the note from Japanese Ambassador,

708
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
Beiyang government has chose to act hard.

709
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,400
Yesterday

710
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,400


711
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued instructions to the Metropolitan Police Department.

712
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,640
Require all police agencies in Beijing

713
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,240
strictly ban the trend of exclusion of Japan.

714
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
Not only that, just this morning

715
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,840
Dongcheng student lecture group

716
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,280
had an altercation with Japanese soldiers.

717
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
They were arrested by the police for that.

718
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,280
arrest?

719
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,560
Many students.

720
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,320
Classmates

721
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
I heard that Xu Shichang has given orders to Beijing

722
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,600
and other provinces.

723
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,000
That all public speech, march and protest

724
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
along with spreading leaflets are to be stopped.

725
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,840
Violators are arrested according to law.

726
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


727
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,640


728
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,920
Are we at fault?

729
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,680
No wonder it's not just the police today.

730
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
Even infantry and cavalry appeared on the streets.

731
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
They are not only arrogant,

732
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,920
they also hit people with no good reasons.

733
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,920
Classmates

734
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,240


735
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,400


736
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:04,800
I heard from Zhong Xie,

737
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,040


738
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
All organizations and unions in Peking University

739
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
have made an unanimous resolution.

740
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,120
We are not doing as the Ministry of Education instructed.

741
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
This order to resume classes in three days.

742
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,280
Classmates who took part in the strike,

743
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,520
You can take all your books and luggage,

744
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,720
pack up,

745
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,640
Once the government enforces the dissolution order forcefully

746
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,000
We will leave school.

747
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,680
Find another way to save the country

748
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,960
Yeah, we'll find another way to save the country.

749
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,200
Exactly!

750
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,120
You don't know.

751
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,560
Now everytime I go to vege market,

752
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,320
Auntie Wu says that

753
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,080
Mrs. Chen, come on, come on.

754
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,880


755
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,880
All these I put aside for you.

756
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm almost a cucumber dealer now.

757
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,080
Yannian

758
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,800
Qiaonian

759
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,080
come over

760
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
You two 

761
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,000
go to Honglou Library of Peking University

762
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,960
Bring the mimeograph machine here again.

763
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,560
This note to the Japanese ambassador

764
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,880
and comment on the phone call by General Duan must be printed today.

765
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,320
Let the ten-people group spread it out tomorrow.

766
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,000
Be sure to let the people see clearly.

767
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,120
Japan's greedy desire

768
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,560
and this government's traitorous behaviour.

769
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,200
Go, go, go

770
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,600


771
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,920
Yes

772
00:27:59,760 --> 00:27:59,920


773
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,960
Yannian Qiaonian

774
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,600


775
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
I will go too.

776
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,760
What's wrong?

777
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
You are always sending the children out in the middle of night. 

778
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,320
I'll go and see

779
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,360
Don't.

780
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,480
There are policemen out everywhere now.

781
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,840


782
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,840
But they

783
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,800
Reckless

784
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,800


785
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,360
It's really dangerous now.

786
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,360


787
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,120
Six more were arrested in Peking University just this morning. 

788
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,760


789
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,760
Do you have any idea

790
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,640
Yu zhengting

791
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,600
Yannian

792
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,600


793
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,320
What are you printing so late?

794
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,520
We are going to the Hong Lou.

795
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,880
Give these newly printed leaflets

796
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,480
to Fu Sinian and Luo Jialun.

797
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,840
Why are you here so late? 

798
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,160
We are grabbing something.

799
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160


800
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,280
Isn't the ten-people group going to preach on the street tomorrow? 

801
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,040
How can they have time to do this now?

802
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,640
You can't disobey your teacher's order.

803
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,600
Need to go.

804
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,040
Peking University is moving to Shanghai?

805
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,200
When did this happen?

806
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,960
Sir

807
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,120
What are you doing at school at this late hour?

808
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,400
How can Peking University move to Shanghai?

809
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
Yes, if you move Peking University to Shanghai,

810
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,760
It's not Peking University, it will be called Shanghai University.

811
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,600
It doesn't matter what the school is called now.

812
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,680
Beijing is a political vortex.

813
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
One sneeze at the presidential palace,

814
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,880
school here will have an earthquake.

815
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,880
People can't settle down to learn at all.

816
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,800
After the school moved to Shanghai

817
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,080
Leave this political vortex.

818
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,600
It is beneficial to the development of the school. 

819
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Isn't this more important?

820
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,000
I have something to do. I'll go first 

821
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,080
Goodbye, sir.

822
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,120
Goodbye, sir.

823
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:27,840


824
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,160
go

825
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,480
Have you done using the mimeograph machines?

826
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,360
Can we borrow it? 

827
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,240
Bai Lan

828
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,320
Go inside and sleep. Don't sleep here.

829
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,320
Let me wait for them to come back.

830
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,560
Why don't you go rest?

831
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,600
I'll just wait here.

832
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,080
No, no.

833
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,760
I'll stay.You go sleep.

834
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,120
They came back.

835
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,920
They are back

836
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,440
I'm worried sick.

837
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,960
You haven't slept yet?

838
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm waiting for you. I'm afraid something will happen to you

839
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
Your dad fell asleep after carving the pattern plate.

840
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,680
Bai Lan and I dare not sleep.

841
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,680
You are back.

842
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,880
Something happened in Hong Lou?

843
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,680
Mr. Hu Shi wrote a proposal about moving Peking University

844
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,360
to Shanghai. 

845
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,400
Himself and

846
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
Fu Sinian, Luo Jialun went to mimeograph.

847
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
We have been waiting for them to finish printing.

848
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,880
What?

849
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,800
Proposal for moving Peking University to Shanghai?

850
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,080
Who initiated it?

851
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,920
I took a copy for you to have a look. 

852
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
Did Hu Shi take the wrong medicine?

853
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,160
What's he thinking?

854
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,120
Such important matter. 

855
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
Why he didn't discuss it with me?

856
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000
Move Peking University to Shanghai.

857
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,200
What's this nonsense?

858
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
Things here in Beijing has just begun to see some lights.

859
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,560
Is he tearing it down ?

860
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,120
Yannian

861
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
Go get him for me.

862
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,360
In the middle of the night, you called someone to lecture. 

863
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,480
It's not appropriate.

864
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,880
It's literally the practice of feudal paternalism.

865
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
Just do as I say.

866
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,480
Stop this nonsense.

867
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,560
It's people's freedom to have a proposal and to print articles.

868
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,600
You can disagree.

869
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
But you have no right to interfere with people's freedom. 

870
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,400
He's making it hard for all of us.

871
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,760
Why can't I interfere?

872
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,720
Are you going or not?

873
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,360
I won't go.

874
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,120
He is a professor at Peking University like you,

875
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,080
not your sidekick.

876
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,960
Why should he listen?

877
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,480
Isn't it too hurtful of you to do so?

878
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,120
Fine

879
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,560
I don't need you.

880
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,840
I'll go by myself

881
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,720
Get out of the way.

882
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,080
Uncle Chen, don't be angry.

883
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,360
Yannian is for your own good.

884
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,720
Yannian is just worried.

885
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
If it gets ugly between you and Uncle Hu,

886
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
it will affect the student movement.

887
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,040
It will hurt you even more.

888
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,840
What does he know?

889
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,160
This is shaking the army's morale.

890
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,680
Pulling the last straw!

891
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,160


892
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,960
Let's start.

893
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,440


894
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
Sir

895
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,080


896
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,040


897
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,640
Where is Shi Zhi?

898
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Why are you here, Mr. Chen?

899
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,720


900
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,720
Professor Hu has gone home.

901
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,840
Where are you going?

902
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,840


903
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,280
His house.

904
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
Why you going his house?

905
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,760
They have new born at home.

906
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,960
I want to ask him.

907
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,960
Why does Hu Shi want to be a traitor?

908
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,280
come on

909
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,920
Let's sit down and talk

910
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,400
come

911
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:20,880
Sit down

912
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:21,680
come

913
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,880
I can't.

914
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,040
Look at what's written here.

915
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,320
Do you know?

916
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,600
The result of Shizhi doing this?

917
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,040
Division!

918
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,320
Mr. Zhongfu

919
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,920
Mr. Hu is doing so for a good cause.

920
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,400
He doesn't want the government...

921
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,280
Stupid

922
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,520
We are the frontline, by doing this

923
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,520
is only leads to break the morale and divert attention.

924
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,800
It's helping the traitors.

925
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,200
As a result, it is inevitable that we will suffer and the enemy will laugh.

926
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,760
Sir.

927
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,400
This kind of flyer

928
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,440
not even one can be seen.

929
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,440
Destroy them all, all.

930
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,160
Sir

931
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,160
We really need to talk to Mr. Hu about this.

932
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
We can't bear this responsibility.

933
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,920
You don't have. I'm responsible for this.

934
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
You are only responsible for take Hu Shi here for me.

935
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
Brother Zhongfu, don't be so impulsive, okay?

936
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
If I don't be impulsive,

937
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,560
our hard-earned revolutionary achievements

938
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,760
is all going to be destroyed.

939
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,760
China, even the whole world now

940
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
Are looking at our Peking University.

941
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,600
They are all watching.

942
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,160
Moving Peking University at this time

943
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,800
is to blow the candle and kill the revolution.

944
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,160
Such a simple truth.

945
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,360
Can't you see clearly?

946
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,360
Do you want to be Zhang Zongxiang, Cao Rulin

947
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,320
or Lu Zongyu?

948
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,400
Or do you want to help the Japanese?

949
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,600
Hurry up and have Mr. Shizhi here.

950
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,080
Yes

951
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,280
Let's talk inside.

952
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,280
Move out, destroy, move out

953
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,720
Destroy it all.

954
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,760
Let's talk.

955
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,480
Move!

956
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,520
Liu Mei, any dried one? 

957
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,120
Yeah, I'll bring it to you later.

958
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,680
Qiaonian

959
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
Take this printed one away quickly.

960
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:57,920
One second.

961
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
How's it going? Close to finish?

962
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,480
Mrs. Chen

963
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,040
Auntie

964
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,680
Auntie

965
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,640
Have some porridge.

966
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,040
My hands are too dirty.

967
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,840
I won't help you this time.

968
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,000
It's okay. I brought handkerchief.

969
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,360
Clean then eat.

970
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,040
It's okay.

971
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,920
We're almost done.

972
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,040
Your Dad, what can I do about him.

973
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,480
He's not coming back this late at night,

974
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,920
but keeps you guys busying until now.

975
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,080
I'm used to that already.

976
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,240
But he doesn't have the right to treat Uncle Hu like that today.

977
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,840
So bossy.

978
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,720
That's who he is, your Dad.

979
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,800
Overly confident and a control freak.

980
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,480
Nobody can manage him.

981
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,720
I'm used to him offending people everywhere.

982
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
But you have to believe,

983
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,080
your father didn't do it for himself. 

984
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,600
He did it for everyone.

985
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,160
His heart is full of bigger things.

986
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,080
I understand all of this. 

987
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
But he always has this temper.

988
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,880
How can it work?

989
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,560
I have read a western proverb.

990
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Habit determines character, character determines fate.

991
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,120
He will suffer a big loss sooner or later.

992
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,120
Yannian

993
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,720
Sometimes

994
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,280
I really think you are so much like your father.

995
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,120
You two always are against each other.

996
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,840
Auntie

997
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm nowhere as blunt as he is.

998
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,440
Shouchang

999
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,080
I really can't understand.

1000
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
Why did Shizhi do this?

1001
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
Why would he?

1002
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,120
Actually, before Yannian came,

1003
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,720
Shizhi and I have already argued.

1004
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,320
He has his ideas.

1005
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,600
He is afraid that the Beiyang government will take the ruthless way

1006
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
and disband Peking University.

1007
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,000
Arrest you and me.

1008
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
So he said he was thinking for you. 

1009
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
Think for me.

1010
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,160
What does that mean?

1011
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
He feels that Peking University has made too many enemies now.

1012
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,600
And get caught deeply in the current political vortex. 

1013
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,360
If there is one spark ignites,

1014
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,680
Peking University will be ruined.

1015
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,120
And we'll be ruined.

1016
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,520
He said it wasn't easy for us to get here today. 

1017
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,040
We can't lose it all.

1018
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,800
So he felt that at this time 

1019
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,320
moving Peking University to Shanghai,

1020
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,160
stay away from all the trouble,

1021
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,680
then we and Peking University will be relieved.

1022
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,120
That's what he said?

1023
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,200
This is his story.

1024
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,440
To me, he is wrong.

1025
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,320
Where he stands and the angle he takes to look at this are wrong.

1026
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,440
The relationship between the fate of a country and a individual is turned upside down.

1027
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,040
What is his stands and angle?

1028
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,000
What perspective?

1029
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,080
He thinks that Peking University should be

1030
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,440
and only be a place of academic study.

1031
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
It should not be mixed with politics.

1032
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,880
Diplomatic disputes

1033
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,000
national interests,

1034
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,960
at the end of the day, all these are the government's business.

1035
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,680
We can express our opinions,

1036
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,600
but we have our own duty to practice.

1037
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
I refuted him explicitly just now.

1038
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
National sovereignty and interests are above all else.

1039
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
Primary and secondary cannot be mixed.

1040
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,440
Now is the crucial moment to boycott the Paris Peace Treaty.

1041
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
At this specific time,

1042
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
moving Peking University is nothing else but running away.

1043
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,560
I just can't imagine this.

1044
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,120
A year ago, he was a hero.

1045
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,600
A former anti-feudal fighter.

1046
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,600
In a flash, he becomes

1047
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,560
this counsellor who hesitates on every move.

1048
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,000
This kind of spirit he shows

1049
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,440
disqualifies him as the coach to the youths.

1050
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,000
This can't be, Shouchang.

1051
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,040
I'm going to find him.

1052
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
I want to pull him back.

1053
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
I introduced him to Peking University.

1054
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,800
Brother Zhongfu.

1055
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,080
I can't leave him like this.

1056
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,640
Brother Zhongfu.

1057
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
Fu Sinian has already gone.

1058
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,880
Brother Zhongfu.

1059
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,360
Didn't Fu Sinian already go?

1060
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
You don't have to be so impulsive

1061
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,760
It's the same for us to wait here.

1062
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,200
What if you did something you would regret?

1063
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,120
You are angry.

1064
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,640
Shouchang

1065
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,400
Go back to the office and close the door.

1066
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,280
Shizhi

1067
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,600
I had your proposal and signature letter

1068
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,480
all torn up.

1069
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,280
Do you know?

1070
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Yes.

1071
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
Fu Sinian has already told me.

1072
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,200
Burn the proposal and letters

1073
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,480
as you want.

1074
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,880
Even if you are burning down my home,

1075
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
I will not be angry at you.

1076
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,520
Why?

1077
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,000
First, you are my teacher.

1078
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,360
My brother.

1079
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,120
Second, you knew

1080
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
it's safer to leave now than to stay. 

1081
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,160


1082
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
You still burned it anyway.

1083
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,080
You did this

1084
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,560
entirely out of the great interests of the country and the nation.

1085
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,240
It's virtuous.

1086
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,160
How can I be angry?

1087
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,040
So you changed your mind?

1088
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,560
Not angry is different from changing mind.

1089
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,960
Fine.

1090
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,400
First

1091
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,400
Shizhi, I want to thank you for thinking for me. 

1092
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,600
But let me ask you something.

1093
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,960
Now hundreds of thousands of students across the country

1094
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,720
they are on the move.

1095
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,880
All China is in solidarity with Peking University.

1096
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,760
At this time, you proposed to move Peking University.

1097
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,960
Peking University is gone. 

1098
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,640
The center of the movement is gone.

1099
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,600
Everyone's effort goes wasted.

1100
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,840
Guo Xingang died for nothing.

1101
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,000
No one can stop the Paris Peace Treaty anymore.

1102
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,680
Have you ever thought about it?

1103
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,280
Of course I have.

1104
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,400
But now the Beiyang government has put pressure onto us. 

1105
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,560
Classes must be resumed within three days.

1106
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
If classes don't resume, we will be forcibly dissolved.

1107
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,520
Let me ask you something too. 

1108
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,200
The dissolution and relocation of Peking University 

1109
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400
Among these two,

1110
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,600
which one is more advantageous?

1111
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
This Peking University in China,

1112
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
this first-class university in China. 

1113
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,840
Why does it have to dissolve when Beiyang government says so?

1114
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,440
If Peking University is disbanded,

1115
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,600
ask the Chinese people if they will agree.

1116
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,480
Ask teachers and students,

1117
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,080
will they accept that?

1118
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,200
Shizhi

1119
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,880
When did you become 

1120
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,880
an obedient sheep of Beiyang government?

1121
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,720
Brother Zhongfu.

1122
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,240
Now that you've put it here.

1123
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm no longer concealing my feelings. 

1124
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
I returned to China from America two years ago

1125
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,960
in order to contribute to the new culture.

1126
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,400
At that time, you said that

1127
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,840
no talking about politics for twenty years,

1128
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,920
devoting yourself in inspiring people's minds.

1129
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,320
I think that exactly is the way 

1130
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,080
the fundamental way for a scholar to love and save the nation.

1131
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,520
Along that path,

1132
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,360
every one of us in New Youth,

1133
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,400
we made concerted efforts.

1134
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,800
we made the new culture movement flourish.

1135
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,600
We changed the once-lifeless old Peking University

1136
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,040
We brought it alive again.

1137
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,560
But then you changed. 

1138
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
You said the new culture movement could not be separated from politics.

1139
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
You even said the New Culture Movement

1140
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,080
it is politics in itself.

1141
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,640
What I want is not only the flourish of Peking University. 

1142
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,600
What I want is the flourish of China

1143
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
We can't get by not talking, not arguing, not fighting.

1144
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,240
What you said, what you want.

1145
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,240
I can understand and I support it. 

1146
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,960
So.

1147
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,840
May Fourth Movement

1148
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,200
Students marched in the streets. 

1149
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Oppose the Paris Peace Treaty

1150
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
I sincerely support them.

1151
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,680
In Shanghai

1152
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,280
I was with Yannian and the others.

1153
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,880
I attended the demonstration in person.

1154
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,240
But it's different now.

1155
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,960
Students don't attend classes, professors don't teach.

1156
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
All schools in Beijing have gone on strike.

1157
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,520
Everyone has gone to politics.

1158
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
The whole society is in chaos, brother Zhongfu.

1159
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,840
Is this what you hope for?

1160
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
Is this the kind of flourish you want?

1161
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,840
We can't sit and wait for that to come, Shizhi.

1162
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,440
We have to fight for it.

1163
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,560
There's no making without breaking

1164
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,280
China now needs warriors and fighters.

1165
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,280
Why do we Chinese can do nothing but just watch.

1166
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
Watch the Paris Peace Treaty get signed.

1167
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,440
Why should we just watch the loss of Qingdao happening.

1168
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,800
Giving it away to the Japanese without even arguing?

1169
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,560
Are we Chinese farm animals?

1170
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
Shall we just wait for the knives to fall?

1171
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,600
Certainly not

1172
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,920
Shall we just get slaughtered like farm animal?

1173
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,960
Certainly not

1174
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm not advocating not to fight

1175
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
I mean, we can't act foolhardy.

1176
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Our power is limited. 

1177
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,400
We should know how to stay away from the mess

1178
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,360
and protect ourselves.

1179
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,120
The reason why I proposed to move Peking University

1180
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,160
to Shanghai. 

1181
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,720
I want to keep Peking University untouched.

1182
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,160
Where we have the campus,

1183
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,200
where we can still have the classes.

1184
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,920
That's all.

1185
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,960
That is a compromise.

1186
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,960
It's surrender

1187
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
The reason why China is so timid now.

1188
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,840
We do not have enough people like Guo Xingang.

1189
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,680
We have too many people like Hu Shi.
