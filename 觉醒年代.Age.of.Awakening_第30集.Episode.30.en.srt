[The Age of Awakening]

00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:07,085
[Episode Thirty]

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,000
Yannian. Qiaonian.

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,360
I'm going to take a job with you.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,040
I just wrote an article.

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,600
The title is

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
"Inform all sides about the Shandong issue"

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,120
This article is written for the general strike tomorrow.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,640
Mainly want to sue everyone.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
Don't think that the Shandong problem

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,640
It's just a matter of the survival of a province.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
It's not just a matter of academic circles.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,320
But the whole of China.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,600
Regardless of academics, politicians and businessmen

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,040
Farmers, labor police, soldiers

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
An official MP journalist

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,680
An official MP journalist

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,880
All of you have to come forward.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,080
Contradiction of national struggle

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,360
Should point to the traitorous government

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,360
And don't be like May 4th again.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,160
Only limited to Cao Rulin Zhang Zongxiang

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,440
Those traitors in Lu Zongyu

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,960
In order to let everyone swim tomorrow

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,160
Everyone can see this article

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,880
We must mimeograph it today.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you willing?

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,880
be willing

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
Okay, go to the Red House Library of Peking University.

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,480
Ask Shouchang to get mimeograph and paper.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,440
We'll print it right here

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:36,320
Love China and defend China 

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,040
Have a look.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560
Have a look.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,840
This is my nineteen nineteen.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
My 1919

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,480
It's Chinese 1919.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,480
And the peace between North and South is broken.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,280
Students wait for it

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
The European Council shall not sign.

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
But now the Japanese shemale comes to be our home.

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,240
To be our Lord.

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
This letter in my hand

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,720
It's a declaration to our President Xu Shichang.

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,560
Can we agree?

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
No, no, no

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
Please support our declaration.

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
Declaration of support

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:21,760


50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:21,840


51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,480
Why should we launch this student movement?

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
Punish national thieves

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
It's just to flatten the cards on the door of the Qing Dynasty.

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
It was replaced by Zhonghua Gate.

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,520
Such a revolution is not complete.

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,520
Cao Rulin Zhangzongxiang Luzong

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
People can kill.

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,120
Save Cai Yuanpei

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,560
Love China and defend the motherland

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,200
Love China and defend the motherland

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
The vast number of workers and friends

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,240
I want to tell you about it today.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
About the Paris Peace Treaty

64
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,600
Our Qingdao, China was in the Qing Dynasty.

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,600
The Germans took it by force.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,320
The Germans defeated this world war. 

67
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,240
We are victorious countries.

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
Because we couldn't beat German pressure. 

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
There's no way to give Qingdao to them.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
But now

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
We defeated Germany.

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Qingdao should be returned to us. 

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
This is a matter of course, right?

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
right

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,480
right

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:34,640


77
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
right

78
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,480
right

79
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:36,720
right

80
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:36,880


81
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
good

82
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,920
At this time, Japan came out to speak.

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,880
It says

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
Our government of the Republic of China wants to borrow money from it. 

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,600
I promised.

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
The management of Qingdao should be handed over to Japan.

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
The beauty of Paris Peace Conference overwhelmed France and Britain. 

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,760
The United States, France and Britain at the Paris Peace Conference

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,960
If you dare not offend Japan, you will agree

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,080
Workers, if so.

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,520
Our victorious country

92
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Not only did I get nothing.

93
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,840
Instead, return Qingdao to us.

94
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,160
To Japan.

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
I'd like you to think it over.

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,760
This is our Chinese business.

97
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
But this thing

98
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,360
We Chinese people can't make decisions by ourselves.

99
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,000
Instead, leave it to foreigners.

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
Is this called axiom?

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,000
Defend China's sovereignty.

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,480
Even more exasperating is that

103
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,200
Such a treaty that disgraces the country.

104
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,760
Our government actually agreed.

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440
I can't believe I agreed to sign.

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,640
Workers, we are the Republic of China 

107
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
What is the Republic of China? 

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Is the people's country of the Republic of China.

109
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,320
I want to ask you about any big thing.

110
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
Have you asked your opinion?

111
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,680
We workmates.

112
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,800
Bleeding, sweating and working hard every day.

113
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,520
Created so much wealth for the country.

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
I want to ask everyone

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,640
Have you been consulted on important state affairs?

116
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no.

117
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
Since the founding of the Republic of China

118
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,640
So many ridiculous things have happened.

119
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,000
What's the one thing that makes you masters of your own affairs? 

120
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
no

121
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,640
We're just a bunch of coolies.

122
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
Be looked down upon

123
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
We can't eat enough.

124
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
Not our master.

125
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
Not the master, not the master.

126
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,640
What are the students' behaviors of taking to the streets?

127
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,760
In order to resist this shameless peace treaty.

128
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
In order to defend China's sovereignty.

129
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,720
In order to exercise our Chinese. 

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
The rights of the state

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
Workers

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
We are all people with a patriotic heart.

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,920
China is our Chinese China.

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Our own country

135
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,920
Who do we not love?

136
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
right

137
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,840
right

138
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,720
so

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
For such a patriotic act of the students

140
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160
We must not stand idly by.

141
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,920
Ignore it!

142
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,320
Pledge to defend China's sovereignty.

143
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,320
Defend China's sovereignty.

144
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,040
Pledge to defend China's sovereignty.

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,360
Shandong issue is not the survival of a province.

146
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
It's a national problem.

147
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
Whether in academic or political circles

148
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
Merchants, laborers, farmers, police

149
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,120
A member of parliament who is a soldier.

150
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
Journalists have to come forward. 

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,360
We don't stand up.

152
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,960
Who can stand up and help us?

153
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
China is my China.

154
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
It's also your China.

155
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,440
China

156
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
China is Chinese.

157
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,240
schoolmate

158
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,760
I want to say a few words.

159
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,080
good

160
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,240
Fellow citizens

161
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,480
I am a textile company.

162
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,960
Shen Deling, Director of Spinning Machine Monopoly Division

163
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
Students' patriotic enthusiasm

164
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,240
Deeply influenced me.

165
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
Now I'm willing to put what I hold in my hand

166
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,600
The exclusive right of spinning machine is publicly given to Chinese people.

167
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,200
To strengthen our country's strength

168
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,920
good

169
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,080


170
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,320
good

171
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,000
Spread out

172
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,280
scatter

173
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,000
Thousand what?

174
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,240
Thousand what?

175
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,720
what's up

176
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:28,880
Thousand what?

177
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,040
what's up

178
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,120


179
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,200


180
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,240
stay/hold one's hand

181
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,440
stay/hold one's hand

182
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
You all stop!

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,400
stay/hold one's hand

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
What you're wearing on your heads

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
Isn't it a Chinese hat?

186
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,800
You stepped on it.

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
Isn't it Chinese land?

188
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
You eat, drink, wear and use. 

189
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
Which one is not the blood and sweat of the people?

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
Why do we speak for you?

191
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,040
And you guys?

192
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
But you are driving us away for the enemy.

193
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
You're wearing police caps.

194
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
Wake up, idiot with baton.

195
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,640
Even if it's not for the country's survival

196
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
You should also live for yourself and your family. 

197
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,080
Think about it.

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
We students come forward.

199
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,440
What did we do wrong?

200
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,800
We did nothing wrong.

201
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,760

Severely punish traitors

The teachers, students.

He was influenced by Mr. Chen Duxiu

227
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
Entrusted by Mr. Li Dazhao

228
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,840
Go to Changsha for support.

229
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,680
I'll invite him next.

230
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
So today

Welcome home!

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,960
thank you

248
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,640
The current situation in Beijing

249
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,080
It is very exciting.

250
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,200
But at the same time

251
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,480
Also full of crisis.

252
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,400
Now the power of Beijing people

253
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,160
And the power of Beiyang government.

254
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
In the midst of a fierce confrontation

255
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,760
And what we should do now

256
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,800
Is to stick to it. 

257
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,360
We should mobilize the efforts of the whole nation.

258
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
We should give full play to the whole nation.

259
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
Come and stick this fight to the end. 

260
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800

261
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,160
And Peking University Student Union.

262
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,560
More than twenty propaganda groups have been organized.

263
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Go to all provinces and cities in the country to preach 

264
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,960
And I came to Changsha, Hunan.

265
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,400
I'd like to invite all of you

266
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,600
My brother

267
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,800
My classmates

268
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
My brothers and sisters.

269
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
Please start a fight with us.

270
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
The patriotic movement of the whole nation

271
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
To save us.

272
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,520
A motherland on the verge of collapse

273
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,240
Okay, okay, okay.

274
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,920
middle

275
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,160


276
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,360
I want to know.

277
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,280
What is this campaign going to achieve?

278
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,760
There is no specific goal.

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
Urge the government to refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty.

280
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,400
Never give Qingdao to Japan.

281
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
What we have to do now

282
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,000
Is to awaken the whole nation.

283
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
We want to transform the whole society.

284
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,720
We need to make workers

285
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
Become the master of the world.

286
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
Okay, okay, okay.

287
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,640
Good point!

288
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,280
classmates

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,600
I brought you something. 

290
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,120
These are Mr. Chen Duxiu and Mr. Li Dazhao

291
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,560

And our latest ideas.

295
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,160
classmates

296
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
Send this out.

297
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,080

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,240


299
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,560
Pass it around to each other.

300
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
Pass it around, everybody.

301
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
You can use this Weekly Review.

Learn about the latest situation in Beijing.

303
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,440
Look, this is the magazine in Beijing.

304
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,280
How can Shandong be given to the Japanese?

305
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,080
We must fight to the end. Yeah

306
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,880
classmates

307
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,400
classmates

308
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,160
Everyone saw it.

309
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,600
Mr. Chen Duxiu's slogan

310
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
Is that all the people stand up 

311
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,400
Solve the problem directly

312
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,200
We Hunan

313
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,560
Can't fall behind.

314
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,280
so

315
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
On behalf of Xinmin Society, I propose

316
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,280
Quickly set up Hunan Students Federation.

317
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
Launch a general strike of students in the province.

318
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,320
same time

319
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,920
Contact all circles in Hunan urgently. 

320
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
Establish Hunan Federation of all walks of life

321
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
Realize the great unity of the people

322
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,240
Okay, okay, okay.

323
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,160
I support the strike.

324
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
Runzhi

325
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,000
Our Hunan Commercial College

326
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,280
Support students to strike

327
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,200
But due to the lack of experience.

328
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:43,920
I suggest

329
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,040
You Xinmin society

330
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,520
Take on the leadership responsibility of the people's grand coalition in the whole province.

331
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,560
You should excuse me more.

332
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,440
be one's unshirkable responsibility

333
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,280
For better guidance

334
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,640
Hunan's patriotic movement

335
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,280
I suggest

336
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
We should follow Beijing's example.

337
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
By Hunan Federation of Students 

338
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,080
Also run a magazine.

339
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
It's called

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
Xiangjiang review

341
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,080
Good!

342
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,120
This is good.

343
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,760
just right

344
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
You can talk to Beijing's Weekly Review

345
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,640
Echo each other

346
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,280
Runzhi

347
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,560
That's a great idea of yours 

348
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
Our May 4th Movement in Beijing! 

349
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,200
It's in the Weekly Review.

350
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,160
Under the guidance of

351
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,960
Mr. Zhongfu will publish several articles in each issue.

352
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,400
He is our commander in chief.

353
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
I think Xiangjiang Review

354
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
Should also play such a role. 

355
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:20,800
right

356
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
As for the editor-in-chief

357
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,400
Runzhi

358
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,560


359
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,760
none but you

360
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,000
classmates

361
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,600
Mazedong is Peking University.

362
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
Member of Journalism Research Association

363
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,240
I suggest

364
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,760
Editor-in-Chief of Xiangjiang Review

365
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
He'll take the job.

366
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,920
Do you agree?

367
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
Agree

368
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,120


369
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,480
Agree

370
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:40,880
Agree

371
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,680
Okay, okay, okay.

372
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,560
classmates

373
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,320
I must

374
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,080
successfully fulfil/execute one's mission 

375
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,800
good

376
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,600

All the major central cities in the country are making trouble. 

576
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
Involvement of the whole society

577
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,800
This is an unprecedented thing. 

578
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,920
Businessmen and laborers in Beijing are also stupid.

579
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
There is a tendency to join hands with students.

580
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,520
During the May 4th Movement.

581
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,560
The students just proposed to severely punish the traitors.

582
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,760
But now it's good.

583
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,800
They have taken the blame.

584
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
Point directly to the government.

585
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,080
If at this time

586
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,520
Don't take tough action

587
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,920
This chaotic situation will surely start a prairie fire.

588
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,440
Spread rapidly throughout China

589
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Director Wu

590
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,160
According to you.

591
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
The student movement has spread all over the country 

592
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
What tough measures are you going to take?

593
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Toughness means that students can't be left unchecked.

594
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,800
The catch should be caught and the sentence should be sentenced. 

595
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
Resolutely perform the functions of the government

596
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
I don't agree with your opinion

597
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,840
I think the root of this mess

598
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,920
Is the departure of Cai Yuanpei.

599
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
If we find a way

600
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
Please bring Cai Yuanpei back

601
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
The students of Peking University are still managed by Cai Yuanpei.

602
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,720
This is much better than using force.

603
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,200
Besides, the cost and loss are much smaller.

604
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,640
You're shaving your hair and carrying a load. You're hot.

605
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,840
You don't know.

606
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,960
Sacrifice those around Yuanpei

607
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,280
A professor advocating the new culture movement. 

608
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,160
It is the behind-the-scenes commander of this mess.

609
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,960
Please help the government quell the chaos.

610
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
It's like talking nonsense and seeking skin with a tiger.

611
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,920
What do you mean, skin with a tiger? 

612
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,480
What attitude are you?

613
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,680
That's my attitude. Why?

614
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,000
Bit by bit

615
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
shut up

616
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
What do you want?

617
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,040
Student movement is no small matter. 

618
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,600
Master and the President in the morning.

619
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
After talking on the phone for a long time, think twice.

620
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,800
Decide to play hardball first.

621
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
Director Wu, you strengthen the police force

622
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,200
Li Tongling

623
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,240
Your gendarmes step up law enforcement patrols.

624
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,400
We are the Republic of China.

625
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,240
Do things in a proper way. 

626
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,800
Students should not be allowed to disturb public order. 

627
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,440
We can't let foreigners, especially Japanese.

628
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
We have no ability to govern.

629
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,680
Ministry of Education and other functional departments.

630
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,240
Be firm and stand out clearly.

631
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,440
We should perform our duties firmly.

632
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,840
A presidential decree will be issued tomorrow morning. 

633
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Jingshi is the first good place. 

634
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
Assemblies, parades and speeches are strictly prohibited.

635
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Spreading leaflets and other social agitation.

636
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,640
Strict civil and military officers are strictly inspected.

637
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,800
If any of the circumstances mentioned in the preceding paragraph occur again 

638
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
Do everything you can to stop it.

639
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
Those who refuse to obey the system.

640
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,480
That is, efforts should be made according to law to curb chaos.

641
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
The president also said

642
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,920
You can't all play hardball.

643
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
It's impossible for a bully to bow hard.

644
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,680
The general principle to solve this mess is just four words. 

645
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
use both hard and soft tactics

646
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,920
We need to do some research.

647
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
As for implementation

648
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
I don't need to say more if you are hard.

649
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,520
Just submit the implementation plan.

650
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,080
But there must be a degree of hardness.

651
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,280
What is the degree?

652
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
Can I arrest people?

653
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm just talking about principles.

654
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,680
That's your business.

655
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
You're slick.

656
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,960
You have to be convicted of reading a job.

657
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,880
Director Wu

658
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,920
If you can really send me to prison 

659
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,800
Avoid this robbery

660
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,200
I really have to burn high incense for you.

661
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,640
What do you mean?

662
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,800
Come on, don't bicker.

663
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,600
The president's meaning is clear.

664
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
Catch what you should, catch what you should hit. 

665
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
Your Ministry of Education has to be tough.

666
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
Hard light can't do it.

667
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,440
If it's hard.

668
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
What's the carrot and stick?

669
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
Then let's study what?

670
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,040
If you are soft, I won't.

671
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
I can't do it alone.

672
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,520
It depends on everyone's cooperation.

673
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
Do you have any good ideas?

674
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,880
Three

675
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,160
Yes, let all schools have an early holiday. 

676
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Second, announce the higher civil service examination.

677
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,640
Third, let some spies and spies

678
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
Break into the students

679
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
Do a good job of plotting against others.

680
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,480
Look, look, look, look.

681
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,800
Don't you have this soft plan?

682
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,600
I think it's as hard as Jing Zhaoyin said.

683
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,240
Article 1 and Article 2 shall be implemented by the Ministry of Education. 

684
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,280
Article

685
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
Director Wu is in charge of your implementation.

686
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,240
good

687
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Don't you have many spies under your command? 

688
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,760
Spend money when you should.

689
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,160
Spend some money to turn them around.

690
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,920
You spend this money

691
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,880
break up

692
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,080
Ll

693
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,160
Instruction of Ministry of Education

694
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,920
Make the principals of each school work with the staff. 

695
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,960
Supervise all students to attend classes within three days.

696
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Violators will be dismissed.

697
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,320
What's the situation? Dismissal

698
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
It seems that since the note

699
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
The Beiyang government will act hard.

700
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,400
yesterday

701
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued instructions to the Metropolitan Police Department.

702
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,640
Require all police agencies in Beijing

703
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,240
Strictly ban the trend of exclusion

704
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
Not only that, just this morning

705
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,840
Dongcheng student lecture group

706
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,280
Have an altercation with Lu Benbing

707
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
I was arrested by the police.

708
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,280
arrest

709
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,560
Many students.

710
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,320
classmates

711
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
I heard that Xu Shichang has given it to Beijing.

712
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,600
The provinces issued orders.

713
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,000
Ask for a rally speech.

714
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Spreading leaflets, etc., try your best to stop it.

715
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,840
Violators are arrested according to law.

716
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


717
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,640
Speed-up

718
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,920
Are we at fault?

719
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,680
No wonder it's not just the police today.

720
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
Even infantry and cavalry took to the streets.

721
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
And it's very arrogant to see people.

722
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,920
Too much and hitting people

723
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,920
classmates

724
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,240
I listen to Zhong's explanation.

725
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,400
I listen to Zhong.

726
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:04,800
I listen to Zhong's explanation.

727
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,040
I listen to Zhong.

728
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
Publications of various organizations in Peking University

729
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
And unanimous resolutions of associations.

730
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,120
Never implement the Ministry of Education

731
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
On the instruction of resuming classes in Sannei

732
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,280
All our classmates who took part in the strike

733
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,520
You can take our books and luggage 

734
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,720
Tidy up

735
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,640
Once the government enforces the dissolution order forcefully

736
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,000
We will leave school.

737
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,680
Find another way to save the country

738
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll find another way to save the country.

739
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,200
exactly

740
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,120
You don't know.

741
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,560
Now I just need to go to the vegetable market.

742
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,320
Then Mama Wu said when she saw me.

743
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,080
Mrs. Chen, come on, come on.

744
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,880
I'll give you a round bag.

745
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm almost a cucumber dealer.

746
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,080
Yannian

747
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,800
Qiaonian

748
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,080
come over

749
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
You two go again.

750
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,000
Honglou Library of Peking University

751
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,960
Bring the mimeograph machine here again.

752
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,560
This note to the Japanese ambassador must be sent today. 

753
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,880
And period of supervision of electricity testimony issued.

754
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,320
Make friends with ten people tomorrow.

755
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,000
Be sure to let the people see clearly.

756
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,120
Japan's wolf ambition

757
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,560
And the government's traitor face.

758
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,200
Go, go, go

759
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,600
good

760
00:27:59,760 --> 00:27:59,920
good

761
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,960
Yannian Qiaonian

762
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,600
I will go too.

763
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,760
I said, what happened to you?

764
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
Always send the children out in the middle of the night 

765
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,320
I'll go and see

766
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,360
Don't go.

767
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,480
There are policemen outside now.

768
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,840
But they

769
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,800
True line

770
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,360
It's dangerous now.

771
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,120
Peking University arrested six more this morning. 

772
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,760
Have you any idea/Do you have any idea

773
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,640
Yu zhengting

774
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,600
Yannian

775
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,320
What are you printing so late?

776
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,520
We are going to the Red Chamber.

777
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,880
Put these newly printed leaflets

778
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,480
Give it to Fu Sinian and Luo Jialun, and send it to them. 

779
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,840
Why are you here so late? 

780
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160
Let's get something.

781
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,280
Isn't a ten-member group going to preach on the street tomorrow? 

782
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,040
How can they have time to do this?

783
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,640
You can't disobey your orders.

784
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm going first.

785
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,040
Peking University is moving to Shanghai.

786
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,200
When did this happen?

787
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,960
sir

788
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,120
What are you doing at school at this late hour?

789
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,400
How can Peking University move to Shanghai?

790
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
Ah, move Peking University to Shanghai.

791
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,760
It shouldn't be called Peking University, it should be called Peking University.

792
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,600
It doesn't matter what the school is called now.

793
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,680
Beijing is a political vortex.

794
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
Sneeze at the presidential palace.

795
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,880
The school will have an earthquake.

796
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,880
People can't settle down to learn at all.

797
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,800
After the school moved to Shanghai

798
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,080
Leave this political vortex.

799
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,600
It is beneficial to the development of the school. 

800
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Is this more important?

801
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,000
I have something to do. I'll go first 

802
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,080
Goodbye, sir.

803
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,120
Goodbye, sir.

804
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:27,840


805
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,160
go

806
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,480
Have you run out of mimeograph machines, classmate?

807
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,360
Can we borrow it? 

808
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,240
Bai Lan

809
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,320
Go inside and sleep. Don't sleep here.

810
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,320
Let me wait for them to come back.

811
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,560
Jenny, why don't you have a rest first?

812
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,600
I'll just wait here

813
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,080
No, no.

814
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,760
I'll just wait. Go inside and sleep.

815
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,120
They came back.

816
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,920
Come back

817
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,440
I'm worried sick.

818
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,960
You haven't slept yet.

819
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm waiting for you. I'm afraid something will happen to you

820
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
Dad fell asleep after carving the steel plate.

821
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,680
Bai Lan and I dare not sleep.

822
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,680
Just came back.

823
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,880
It's the red chamber. What can I do for you?

824
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,680
Mr. Hu Shi wrote a book about Peking University

825
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,360
Proposal for moving to Shanghai 

826
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,400
He also brought it himself.

827
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
Go to mimeograph with some classmates in Fu Sinian and Luo Jialun.

828
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
We have been waiting for them to finish printing.

829
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,880
What?

830
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,800
Proposal for moving Peking University to Shanghai

831
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,080
Who initiated it?

832
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,920
I took a copy for you to have a look. 

833
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
Did Hu Shi take the wrong medicine?

834
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,160
What does he think?

835
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,120
Such an important thing. 

836
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
Why don't you discuss it with me?

837
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000
Move Peking University to Shanghai.

838
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,200
Isn't this nonsense?

839
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
The drama here in Beijing has just begun.

840
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,560
Is it a curtain call?

841
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,120
Yannian

842
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
Go get him for me.

843
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,360
In the middle of the night, you called someone to lecture. 

844
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,480
It's not appropriate, is it

845
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,880
It is simply the practice of feudal paternalism

846
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
You can call when I tell you to.

847
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,480
What are you doing with this nonsense?

848
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,560
It's somebody else's freedom to advocate printing articles.

849
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,600
You can disagree.

850
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
But you have no right to interfere with people's freedom. 

851
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,400
He's making a desperate effort.

852
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,760
Why can't I interfere?

853
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,720
Are you going or not?

854
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,360
I won't go./I won't be there.

855
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,120
He is a professor at Peking University like you. 

856
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,080
I'm not your sidekick.

857
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,960
Why should I listen to you

858
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,480
Is it too hurtful of you to do so?

859
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,120
good

860
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,560
I don't need you.

861
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,840
I'll go by myself

862
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,720
Get out of the way.

863
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,080
Uncle Chen, don't be angry.

864
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,360
Yannian is for your own good.

865
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,720
Yannian is just worried.

866
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
As soon as you get into trouble with Uncle Hu.

867
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
Will affect the student movement.

868
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,040
It will hurt yourself even more.

869
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,840
What does he know?

870
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,160
shake the army's morale

871
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,680
Be short of success.

872
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,160
work

873
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,440
sir

874
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,080
sir

875
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,040
史鸷呢

876
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Why are you here, Mr. Chen?

877
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,720
Professor Hu has gone home.

878
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,840
Where are you going?

879
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,280
I went to his house to look for him.

880
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
What are you doing at his house?

881
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,760
There are children who have just turned full moon at home.

882
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,960
I just want to ask him.

883
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,960
Why does Hu Shi want to be a traitor?

884
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,280
come on

885
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,920
Let's sit down and talk

886
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,400
come

887
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:20,880
Sit down and say

888
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:21,680
come

889
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,880
I can't sit down.

890
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,040
Look at what's written here.

891
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,320
You know

892
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,600
What is the result of Shizhi's doing this?

893
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,040
stir up division

894
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,320
中富先生

895
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,920
Mr. Hu is also kind in doing so.

896
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,400
He doesn't want the government.

897
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,280
muddled

898
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,520
Enemy, do you do this now? 

899
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,520
Is to break the morale and divert attention.

900
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,800
Help the traitor.

901
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,200
As a result, it is inevitable that the relatives will be bitter and the enemies will be quick.

902
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,760
sir

903
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,400
This kind of flyer signature letter

904
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,440
You can't send any.

905
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,440
Destroy them all. Destroy them all

906
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,160
sir

907
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,160
Why don't you ask Professor Hu about it?

908
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
We really can't bear this responsibility.

909
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,920
You don't have to be responsible. I'll do it.

910
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
You are only responsible for calling Hu Shi to me.

911
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
Brother Zhongfu, don't be so impulsive, okay?

912
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
I'm not impulsive.

913
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,560
Our hard-earned revolutionary achievements

914
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,760
It's going to be destroyed.

915
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,760
China and even the whole world.

916
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
Are looking at our Peking University.

917
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,600
Are looking at our Peking University.

918
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,160
You are going to move Peking University at this time.

919
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,800
Is to blow the candle and kill the revolution.

920
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,160
Such a simple truth.

921
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,360
Can't you see clearly?

922
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,360
You have to be Zhang Zongxiang of Cao Rulin.

923
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,320
With Lu Zongyu.

924
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,400
Or do you want to help the Japanese

925
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,600
Hurry up and invite Mr. Shizhi.

926
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,080
be

927
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,280
Let's talk inside.

928
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,280
Move out, destroy, move out

929
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,720
Destroy it all.

930
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,760
Go in and say it. Go in and say it 

931
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,480
Move out

932
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,520
Liu Mei, is there anything else to do? 

933
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,120
I'll bring it to you later.

934
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,680
Qiaonian

935
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
Take this printed one away quickly.

936
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:57,920
hold on

937
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
How's it going? Are you busy enough?

938
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,480
wife of one's teacher/master

939
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,040
auntie

940
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,680
auntie

941
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,640
Have some porridge.

942
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,040
Jenny, my hands are too dirty.

943
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,840
I won't help you.

944
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,000
It's okay. I brought a handkerchief

945
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,360
You can eat it later when you've cleaned it.

946
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,040
没事伯母

947
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,920
We're almost done.

948
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,040
Tell me about your father. He's really

949
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,480
Don't come back so late.

950
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,920
Keep your son busy until now

951
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,080
He's used to this for me.

952
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,240
But why should he treat others today?

953
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,840
Uncle Hu Shi so overbearing.

954
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,720
That's what you are, dad.

955
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,800
Just for your own use. 

956
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,480
Nobody can control him.

957
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,720
I'm used to offending people everywhere.

958
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
You have to believe

959
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,080
Your father didn't do it for himself. 

960
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,600
He did it for everyone.

961
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,160
His heart is full of big things.

962
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,080
I understand all of this. 

963
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
But he always has this temper.

964
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,880
How can it work?

965
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,560
I have read a western proverb.

966
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Habit determines character, character determines fate.

967
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,120
He will suffer a big loss sooner or later.

968
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,120
Yannian

969
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,720
sometimes

970
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,280
I really think you are so much like your father.

971
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,120
It's always pointed at the wheat. 

972
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,840
auntie

973
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,680
Am I as blunt as he is?

974
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,440
Shouchang

975
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,080
I really can't understand.

976
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
Why did Shizhi do this?

977
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
Why would he do that?

978
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,120
Actually, before Yannian came,

979
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,720
Shizhi and I have already argued.

980
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,320
He has his ideas.

981
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,600
He is afraid that the Beiyang government will really dare to kill him.

982
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
To disband Peking University.

983
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,000
Arrest you and me.

984
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
So he said he was thinking about you. 

985
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
Think for me.

986
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,160
What do you mean?

987
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
He feels that Peking University has made too many enemies now.

988
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,600
And get caught up in the current political vortex. 

989
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,360
Whenever a spark ignites

990
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,680
Peking University will be ruined.

991
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,120
And we'll be ruined.

992
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,520
He said it wasn't easy for us to get here today. 

993
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,040
We can't lose all our efforts.

994
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,800
So he felt that watching this time 

995
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,320
Move Peking University to Shanghai.

996
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,160
Away from the wrong place.

997
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,680
We and Peking University will be relieved.

998
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,120
That's what he said.

999
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,200
This is his story.

1000
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,440
Actually, it seems to me that he is wrong.

1001
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,320
The position and angle of thinking are wrong.

1002
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,440
The relationship between the fate of the country and the individual has been turned upside down.

1003
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,040
What is his position?

1004
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,000
What perspective?

1005
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,080
He thinks that Peking University should be

1006
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,440
It is a place of learning.

1007
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
It should not be mixed with politics.

1008
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,880
Diplomatic disputes

1009
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,000
national interest

1010
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,960
In the final analysis, it is the government's business.

1011
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,680
We can express our opinions.

1012
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,600
But it can't be replaced.

1013
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
I refuted him explicitly just now.

1014
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
National sovereignty and interests are above all else.

1015
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
Primary and secondary cannot be mixed.

1016
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,440
Now is the crucial moment to boycott the Paris Peace Treaty.

1017
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
At this juncture.

1018
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
Moving south of Peking University is tantamount to running away.

1019
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,560
I can't imagine.

1020
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,120
A year ago, he was a hero.

1021
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,600
A former anti-feudal fighter.

1022
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,600
In a flash, it becomes

1023
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,560
A counsellor who hesitates before and after.

1024
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,000
This spirit

1025
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,440
How can I afford the reputation of a young tutor?

1026
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,000
不行寿昌

1027
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,040
I'm going to find him.

1028
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
I want to pull him back.

1029
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
I introduced him to Peking University.

1030
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,800
中富兄

1031
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,080
I can't ignore it

1032
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,640
中富兄

1033
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
Fu Sinian has already gone.

1034
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,880
中富兄

1035
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,360
Didn't Fu Sinian already go?

1036
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
You don't have to be so impulsive

1037
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,760
It's the same for us to wait here.

1038
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,200
How can you do it if you go wrong?

1039
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,120
You are angry.

1040
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,640
Shouchang

1041
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,400
Go back to the office and close the door.

1042
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,280
Shizhi

1043
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,600
I'll send your proposal and signature letter

1044
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,480
It's all torn up

1045
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,280
Do you know

1046
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,400
I see

1047
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
Mi Nian has already told me.

1048
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,200
Don't say you put the proposal

1049
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,480
And signed letters were burned.

1050
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,880
You burned down my Hu Shi home.

1051
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
I can't be angry either.

1052
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,520
Why?

1053
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,000
First, you are my teacher.

1054
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,360
My brother

1055
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,120
Second, you clearly know

1056
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
It's safer to leave now than to stay. 

1057
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,160
And safer.

1058
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
You still burned it resolutely.

1059
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,080
You would do this?

1060
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,560
It is entirely out of the great interests of the country and the nation.

1061
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,240
It's virtuous.

1062
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,160
How can I be angry?

1063
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,040
So you figured it out?

1064
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,960
good

1065
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,400
first

1066
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,400
Shizhi, I want to thank you for thinking for me. 

1067
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,600
But let me ask you something.

1068
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,960
Now hundreds of thousands of students across the country

1069
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,720
It's all sexual.

1070
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,880
All China is in solidarity with Peking University.

1071
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,760
At this time, you proposed to move Peking University.

1072
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,960
Peking University is gone. 

1073
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,640
The center of the movement is gone.

1074
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,600
Everyone's efforts were wasted.

1075
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,840
Guo Xingang's life was wasted.

1076
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,000
No one can stop the Paris Peace Treaty.

1077
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,680
Have you ever thought about it?

1078
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,280
I don't know what you said.

1079
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,400
But now the Beiyang government has come hard. 

1080
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,560
Classes must be resumed within three days.

1081
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
If classes don't resume, they will be forcibly dissolved.

1082
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,520
Let me ask you something. 

1083
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,200
The dissolution and relocation of Peking University 

1084
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400
Compare the two

1085
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,600
Which one is more advantageous?

1086
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
It's Peking University in China. 

1087
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
First-class universities in China 

1088
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,840
Why does it dissolve when Beiyang government says it will?

1089
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,440
Peking University disbanded

1090
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,600
Ask the Chinese people if they will agree.

1091
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,480
Teacher of Peking University

1092
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,080
Will the students of Peking University answer yes or no? 

1093
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,200
Shizhi

1094
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,880
When did you become one?

1095
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,880
Sheep taken by Beiyang government

1096
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,720
中富兄

1097
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,240
Now that you've put it here.

1098
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm no longer full of my opinions. 

1099
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
I returned to China from America two years ago. 

1100
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,960
In order to do a good job in the new culture.

1101
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,400
At that time, you said a word

1102
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,840
Twenty years without talking about politics

1103
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,920
Devote oneself to inspiring national thoughts.

1104
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,320
I think this is a scholar.

1105
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,080
And the fundamental way of patriotism and saving the nation.

1106
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,520
On this road.

1107
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,360
Every one of us in New Youth.

1108
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,400
make concerted efforts

1109
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,800
Make the new culture movement flourish.

1110
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,600
Put the once-lifeless old Peking University

1111
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,040
Become alive.

1112
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,560
But then you changed. 

1113
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
You said the new culture movement could not be separated from politics.

1114
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
You even said the New Culture Movement.

1115
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,080
It is politics in itself.

1116
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,640
What I want is not the vitality of Peking University. 

1117
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,600
What I want is the vitality of China

1118
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
No arguing, no arguing, no arguing.

1119
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,240
What you said, argue for it.

1120
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,240
I can understand and I support it. 

1121
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,960
so

1122
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,840
May Fourth Movement

1123
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,200
Students marched in the streets. 

1124
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Oppose the Paris Peace Treaty

1125
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
I sincerely support it.

1126
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,680
In Shanghai

1127
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,280
I'm still with Yannian and them.

1128
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,880
Attended the demonstration in person.

1129
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,240
But it's different now.

1130
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,960
Students don't attend classes, professors don't teach.

1131
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
All schools in Beijing have gone on strike.

1132
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,520
Everyone has gone to politics.

1133
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
The whole society is in chaos, brother Zhongfu.

1134
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,840
Is this your Chen Zhongfu?

1135
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
Do you want to see more vitality?

1136
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,840
Yi ran is not waiting for Shizhi.

1137
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,440
It's a struggle

1138
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,560
there's no making without breaking

1139
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,280
Than China needs warriors and fighters.

1140
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,280
Why do we Chinese have a narrow-minded attitude?

1141
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
Looking at the signing of the Paris Peace Treaty

1142
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,440
Why should we look at Qingdao with a narrow-minded eye?

1143
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,800
Give it to the Japanese

1144
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,560
We Chinese

1145
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
Should I die like an animal?

1146
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,600
certainly not

1147
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,920
Should you be slaughtered like an animal?

1148
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,960
certainly not

1149
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm not advocating not to fight

1150
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
I mean, we can't act foolhardy.

1151
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Our strength is limited. 

1152
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,400
We should know how to stay away from right and wrong.

1153
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,360
Protect yourself

1154
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,120
The reason why I brought Peking University up 

1155
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,160
Moving south to Shanghai 

1156
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,720
I want to keep Peking University.

1157
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,160
Stay in Qingshan

1158
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,200
Not afraid of burning wood. 

1159
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,920
That's all I am.

1160
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,960
This is a compromise.

1161
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,960
It's surrender

1162
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
The reason why China is so timid

1163
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,840
Because Guo Xingang is too little.

1164
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,680
There are too many Shi.
