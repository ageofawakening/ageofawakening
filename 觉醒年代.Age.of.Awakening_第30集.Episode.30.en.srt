I need you two for a mission.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,040
I just wrote an article.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,600
The title is

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
"Inform all people about the Shandong issue".

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,120
This article is written for the general strike tomorrow.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,640
It aims to warn everyone out there.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
Don't think the Shandong issue

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,640
is just a matter of the survival of one province.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
It's not just a matter for academics.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,320
It is an incoming danger for the whole China.

All of you have to come forward.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,080
This arrow of the national movement should point at

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,360
the traitorous government.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,360

You okay doing this?

29

Okay, go to the Red House Library of Peking University.

we have defeated Germany.

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Qingdao should be returned to us.

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,880

But, Japan came out.

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,880
They say

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
our government of the Republic of China wanted to borrow money from Japan.

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,600
So they agreed that

82
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
the administration of Qingdao would be handed over to Japan.

84

dare not provoke Japan, so they went along with it.

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,080

86
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,520
this country, as a victorious country,

87
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
not only did we not have any gain from our victory,

88
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,840
instead of Qingdao's return,

89
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,160
we are losing it to Japan.

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
I'd like you to think it over.

91
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,760
This matter belongs to the Chinese people.

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
However,

93
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,360
we Chinese people can't make decisions by ourselves.

94
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,000
Instead, those foreigners somehow has that power.

our government actually agreed on

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,760

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
where our opinions are valued?

I want to ask everyone

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,640
have you been consulted on important state affairs?

No, no, no!

112
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
Since the founding of the Republic of China,

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,640
so many ridiculous things have happened.

114

What's the one thing that makes you masters of your own affairs?

115

No, no!

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,640

117

Not our own masters!

121
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,640
Why are the students taking it to the streets?

122
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,760
They are boycotting this shameless peace treaty.

123
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
They are defending China's sovereignty.

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,720
They are exercising their rights,

125
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
the rights as a Chinese citizen to have a say in this country.

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360

China is our Chinese's China.

129

who else will?

131
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,840
Right!

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,720
So,

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
we can't just stand by and watch

134
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160

135
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,920
We can't ignore it.

136

who will stand up and help us?

147
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
China is my China.

148
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
It's also your China.

I want to say a few words.

153
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,080
Okay.

154
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,240
Fellow citizens,

155
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,480

The students' patriotic enthusiasm

158
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,240
has touched me deeply.

159
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
Now I'm willing to give what I hold in my hand to the public,

160
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,600

So that our country's strength is empowered.

162

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,200
What are you doing?

167

Stop!

168
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,440
Stop!

169
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
You all stop!

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,400
Stop!

171
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
What you're wearing on your heads,

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
isn't it a Chinese hat?

173
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,800
The soil you stepped on right now,

174
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
isn't it Chinese land?

You might be wearing police caps,

181
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
but you are merely idiots holding a police sticks now, wake up!

182
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,640
Even if you don't care for the country's survival.

183
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
Can't you think it over just for the sake of you and your family?

184
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,080
Think about it.

But at the same time

237
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,480
also full of crisis.

What we should do now

242
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,800
is to stick to it.

243
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,360
We should mobilize the efforts of the whole nation.

244
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
We should team up with every Chinese

245
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
and keep fighting to the end.

To urge the government to refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty.

265
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,400
To never give Qingdao to Japan.

266

to learn about the latest situation in Beijing.

287

Look, this is the paper from Beijing.

288
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,280
How can Shandong be given to the Japanese?

289
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,080

Everyone has read it.

293
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,600
Mr. Chen Duxiu's slogan

294
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
is "All people must stand up

295
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,400
to solve the problem directly".

296
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,200
We in Hunan

297
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,560
cannot fall behind.

298
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,280
So,

299
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
on behalf of Xinmin Society, I propose

300
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,280
to set up Hunan Students Federation fast

301
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
to launch a general strike of students in the whole province.

302
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,320
At the same time,

303
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,920
contact all parties in Hunan urgently.,

304
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
to establish Hunan Federation of all walks of life

305
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
and achieve the great unity of the people.

306
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,240
Hurrah!

307
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,160
I support the strike.

308
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
Runzhi,

309
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,000
Our Hunan Commercial College

310
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,280
supports students to strike.

311
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,200
But due to the lack of experience,

312
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:43,920
I suggest

313
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,040
that Xinmin Society should take the lead

314
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,520
on this people's grand coalition in the whole province.

315
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,560
You will take the responsibility.

316
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,440
With no hesitations.

317
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,280
For better guidance

318
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,640
of Hunan's patriotic movement,

319
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,280
I suggest

320
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
that we should follow Beijing's example.

321
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
Hunan Federation of Students should also

322
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,080
run a magazine.

323
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
It's called

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
the "Xiangjiang Review"

325
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,080
Good.

326
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,120
This is good.

327
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,760
Luckily,

328
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
It can just echo with Beijing's

329
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,640
"Weekly Review".

330
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,280
Runzhi,

331
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,560
that's a great idea.

332
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
Our May 4th Movement in Beijing

333
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,200
was guided

334
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,160
by the "Weekly Review".

335

Mr. Zhongfu publishes several articles in each issue.

He is our commander-in-chief.

337
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
I think "Xiangjiang Review"

338
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
should also play such a role.

339
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:20,800
Right.

378
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,880
Now,

379
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
let's have Zhao Shiyan

380
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
tell us about the situation in Beijing.

381
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
Beijing and Tianjin are as close as lips and teeth

382
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
The situation in Beijing is very urgent now.

383
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,520
We need support from all over the country.

384
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Before the end of the month, the Beijing Federation of Students will organize

385
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,440
large-scale demonstrations and petitions.

386
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
I hope all major cities in the country

387
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,080
join us.

388
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,960
Firstly,

389
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,560
to demonstrate all Chinese students' determination

390
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,560
in this patriotic movement.

391
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,120
Secondly, to prepare for the establishment of the National Federation of Students.

392
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,920
This is also the purpose and mission of my visit here to Tianjin.

393
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
I brought some

394
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720

in Beijing.

402
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,400
Next, Deng Wenshu please,

403
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,440
give everyone an introduction.

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,400
All schools in Tianjin

408
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,840
will send representatives to attend.

409
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,800
To express

410
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,920
our determination to fight till the end

411
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,240
together with Beijing academic circles

412
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,800
Our academic circles in Tianjin have drafted a pledge.

413
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
There are six articles altogether.

414
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,440
First, pledge to guard the motherland.

415
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,520
Second, pledge to protect the sovereignty.

416
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,120
Third, pledge to wipe off national humiliation.

417
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
Fourth, pledge to rid the country of traitors.

418
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,960
Fifth, pledge to face danger together.

419
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Sixth, pledge to always stand side by side.

424
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,080
We have decided

425
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,160
to follow Peking University's "Weekly Review"

426
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,080
and establish the "Tianjin Student Union Newspaper".

427
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,840
Given the fact that Zhou Enlai

428
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
has established "School Spirit" and "Dedication"

429
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
in Nankai before,

430
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,960
he has rich experience in running journals.

431
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Through joint decision,

432
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,600
we have hired Zhou Enlai

433
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,720
as our editor-in-chief.

434
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,680
This is a difficult and bitter job.

435
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,200
Comrade Enlai has been worked on this by himself

436
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,240
for more than half a month.

437
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480

let's invite Zhou Enlai

440
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,880

Soon after I came back,

443
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,560

445
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Being editor-in-chief of Student Union Newspaper,

446
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,640
to me,

447
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,320
is an unshirkable responsibility.

448
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,560
Based on "New Youth", "Weekly Review", "The Renaissance"

449
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,720
and other papers

450
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,600
in Beijing,

451
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,480
We made the preliminary draft

452
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,480
focusing on advocating ideas and commenting on current politics.

453
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,160
We set up eight columns

454
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
including New Trend and New Ideas.

455
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,600
We also have 20 codes for running this paper.

456
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
It mainly can be expressed in two sentences.

457
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
All proposals being released are based on the spirit of democracy.

458
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
With the spirit of innovation for both our heart and mind as the main theme.

459
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
We publicize new thoughts,

460
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,720
report and comment on current affairs both domestic and abroad

461
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,240
and the national student movement.

462
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720

as the situation in Tianjin and the whole country keeps envolving.

464

465
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,920

Chief editor Zhou,

467
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,800
can you tell us about

468
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,320
the difference between innovation for the heart and for the mind?

469
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,680
Sure.

470
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,440
In brief,

471
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,400
innovation for our minds

472
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
is to transform society.

473
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,760
Innovation for our hearts

474
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
is to transform our own ideology.

475
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,040
The latter one is the premise and foundation of the former one.

476
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
Innovation is revolutionary.

477
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm going to write an inaugural article for the paper

478
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,360
discussing these two innovations.

479
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,920
To call on the patriotic youth to consciously

480
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,280
combine transformation of one's own thoughts

481
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,040
and of the whole society.

482

all round the world.

484
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
To awaken the consciousness of the people

485
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,960
and unite those with such aspirations

486
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440

496

This kind of involvement of the whole society.

538
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,800
It is unprecedented.

Merchants and laborers in Beijing are also onto something.

540

There is a tendency they will join hands with students.

But now,

What tough measures are you going to take?

554
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Toughness means that students can't be doing whatever they want.

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
I don't agree.

558
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,840
I think the root of this mess

559
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,920
is the dismissal of Cai Yuanpei.

560
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
If we find a way

561
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
to bring Cai Yuanpei back,

562
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
and have the students of Peking University managed by Cai Yuanpei,

563
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,720
it'll be much better than using force.

564
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,200
Besides, the cost and loss are much smaller.

565
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,640
You are only focusing on one end.

566
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,840
You should know that

567
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,960
those professors

568
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,280
the ones advocating the New Culture Movement around Cai Yuanpei.

569
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,160
They are the behind-the-scenes commander of this mess.

570
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,960
Ask them to help ease the situattion is a ridiculous move.

571
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
Nonsense, you might as well daydreaming.

572
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,920
What did you say, nonsense?

573
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,480
Is that your attitude?

574
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,680
Yes, you have a problem?

575
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,000
Every one.

576
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
Shut up!

577
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
What do you want?

578
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,040
The students' movement is no small matter.

579
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,600
General Duan and the President had a long call in the morning.

580
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
They have given due thoughts about this.

581
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,800
And they decided to take tough actions first.

582
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
Chief Wu, you strengthen the police force.

583
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,200
Commander Li,

584
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,240
your gendarmes strengthen the law enforcement patrols.

585
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,400
We are the Republic of China.

586
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,240
There rules and regulations we need to follow.

587
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,800
Students should not be allowed to disturb public order.

588
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,440
We also can't let foreigners, especially Japanese,

589
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
to mock us that we have no ability to govern.

590
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,680
The Ministry of Education and other functional departments

591
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,240
should be firm on both daily operations and public statement clearly.

592
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,440
We should perform our duties firmly.

593
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,840
A presidential decree will be issued tomorrow morning.

594
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
The capital city is the crucial place.

595
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
Assemblies, parades and speeches are strictly prohibited.

596
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Spreading leaflets and other social agitation

597
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,640
will be strictly inspected by civil and military officers.

598
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,800
If any of the precedent circumstances occurs again,

599
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
do everything you can to stop it.

600
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
For those who refuse to obey,

601
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,480
countermeasures shall be made according to law to cease the chaos.

602
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
The President also said

603
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,920
we can't be all tough and strict.

604
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
We can't push too hard.

605
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,680
The general principle to solve this mess is four words,

606
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
tough but also gentle.

607
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,920
Which we need to have further discussion about.

608
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
As for implementation,

609
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
I don't need to instruct you as you all know how to play it tough.

610
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,520
Just submit your plan.

611
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,080
But there must be a limit of hardness.

612
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,280
Where should we draw the line?

613
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
Can I arrest people?

614
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm only talking about principles.

615
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,680
It's your business on how to carry out.

616
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
You're slick.

617
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,960
That's crime of omission.

618
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,880
Chief Wu,

619
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,920
if you can really send me to prison now

620
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,800
to avoid all these,

621
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,200
I will thank you from the bottom of my heart.

622
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,640
What do you mean?

623
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,800
Come on, don't bicker.

624
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,600
The president's order is clear.

625
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
Arrest and punishment when needed.

626
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
Your Ministry of Education has to be tough too.

627
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
We can't be all tough.

628
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,440
If that's the case,

629
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
it won't be the carrot and stick.

630
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
Then what's there to discuss about?

631
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,040
You can be gentle, I will not.

632
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
I can't do it alone.

633
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,520
It depends on everyone's cooperation.

634
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
Do you have any good ideas?

635
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,880
Three ideas.

636
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,160
First, all schools have an early holiday.

637
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Second, announce the higher-rank civil service examination.

638
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,640
Third, have spies

639
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
merge into the student groups,

640
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
and to break their organization from inside.

641
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,480
See.

642
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,800
Don't we have the gentle approach now?

643
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,600
I say we adopt what mayor just said.

644
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,240
The first two shall be implemented by the Ministry of Education.

645
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,280
The third one,

646
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
Chief Wu is in charge.

647
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,240
Good.

648
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Don't you have many spies under your command?

649
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,760
Spend money when you should.

650
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,160
Spend some money, have the spies work.

651
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,920
You are gonna give me the funds?

652
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,880
Dismissed.

653
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,160
By order of the Ministry of Education,

654
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,920
all principals of each school shall work with the staff,

655
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,960
supervise all students to attend classes within three days.

656
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Violators will be dismissed.

657
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,320
What's the situation? Dismissal?

658
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
It seems that since the note from the Japanese Ambassador,

659
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
Beiyang government has chose to act hard.

660
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,400
Yesterday,

661
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued instructions to the Metropolitan Police Department

662
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,640
to require all police agencies in Beijing

663
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,240
to strictly ban the trend of exclusion of Japan.

664
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
Not only that, just this morning,

665
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,840
the Dongcheng student lecture group

666
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,280
had an altercation with Japanese soldiers.

667
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
They were arrested by the police for that.

668
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,280
Arrested?

669
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,560
Many students.

670
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,320
Students!

671
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
I heard that Xu Shichang has given orders to Beijing

672
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,600
and other provinces

673
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,000
that all public speech, march and protest

674
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
along with spreading leaflets are to be stopped.

675
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,840
Violators are arrested according to law.

676
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:54,314
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

677
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Arrested?

678
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,640
Arrested?

679
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,920
Are we at fault?

680
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,680
No wonder it's not just the police today.

681
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
Even infantry and cavalry appeared on the streets.

682
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
They are not only arrogant, they also hit people for no reason.

683
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,920
That's too much! They hit people!

684
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,920
Students!

685
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,040
I heard from Zhongxie,

686
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
all organizations and unions in Peking University

687
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
have made an unanimous resolution.

688
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,120
We are not doing as the Ministry of Education instructed.

689
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
This order to resume classes in three days.

690
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,280
Classmates who took part in the strike,

691
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,520
You can take all your books and luggage,

692
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,720
pack up,

693
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,640
once the government enforces the dissolution order forcefully.

694
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,000
We will leave school.

695
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,680
Find another way to save the country.

696
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,960
Yeah, we'll find another way to save the country.

697
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,200
Exactly!

698
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,120
You don't know.

699
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,560
Now everytime I go to vegetable market,

700
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,320
Auntie Wu says that

701
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,080
Mrs. Chen, come on, come on.

702
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,880
All these I put aside for you.

703
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm almost a cucumber dealer now.

704
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,080
Yannian.

705
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,800
Qiaonian.

706
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,080
Come over.

707
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
You two

708
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,000
go to the Red Building Library of Peking University.

709
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,960
Bring the mimeograph machine here again.

710
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,560
This note to the Japanese Ambassador

711
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,880
and comment on the phone call by General Duan must be printed today.

712
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,320
Let the ten-people group spread it out tomorrow.

713
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,000
Be sure to let the people see clearly.

714
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,120
Japan's greedy desire

715
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,560
and this government's traitorous behaviour.

716
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,200
Go, go, go.

717
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,920
Yes.

718
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,960
Yannian. Qiaonian.

719
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,600
I will go too.

720
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,760
What's wrong?

721
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
You are always sending the children out in the middle of night.

722
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,320
I'll go and see.

723
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,360
Don't.

724
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,480
There are policemen out everywhere now.

725
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,840
But they-

726
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,800
Reckless.

727
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,360
It's really dangerous now.

728
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,120
Six more were arrested in Peking University just this morning.

729
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,760
Do you have any idea?

730
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,640
Yu Zhengting.

731
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,600
Yannian.

732
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,320
What are you printing so late?

733
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,520
We are going to the Red Building.

734
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,880
Give these newly printed leaflets

735
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,480
to Fu Sinian and Luo Jialun.

736
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,840
Why are you here so late?

737
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160
We are grabbing something.

738
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,280
Isn't the ten-people group going to preach on the street tomorrow?

739
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,040
How can they have time to do this now?

740
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,640
You can't disobey your teacher's order.

741
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,600
Need to go.

742
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,040
Peking University is moving to Shanghai?

743
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,200
When did this happen?

744
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,960
Sir.

745
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,120
What are you doing at school at this late hour?

746
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,400
How can Peking University move to Shanghai?

747
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
Yes, if you move Peking University to Shanghai,

748
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,760
It's not Peking University, it will be called Shanghai University.

749
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,600
It doesn't matter what the school is called now.

750
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,680
Beijing is a political vortex.

751
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
One sneeze at the presidential palace,

752
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,880
school here will have an earthquake.

753
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,880
People can't settle down to learn at all.

754
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,800
After the school moves to Shanghai

755
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,080
and leaves this political vortex,

756
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,600
it is beneficial to the development of the school.

757
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Isn't this more important?

758
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,000
I have something to do. I'll go first.

759
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,080
Goodbye, sir.

760
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,120
Goodbye, sir.

761
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,160
Go.

762
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,480
Have you done using the mimeograph machines?

763
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,360
Can we borrow it?

764
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,240
Bai Lan.

765
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,320
Go inside and sleep. Don't sleep here.

766
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,320
Let me wait for them to come back.

767
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,560
Why don't you go rest?

768
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,600
I'll just wait here.

769
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,080
No, no.

770
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,760
I'll stay. You go sleep.

771
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,120
They came back.

772
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,920
They are back.

773
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,440
I'm worried sick.

774
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,960
You haven't slept yet?

775
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm waiting for you. I'm afraid something will happen to you

776
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
Your dad fell asleep after carving the pattern plate.

777
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,680
Bai Lan and I dare not sleep.

778
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,680
You are back.

779
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,880
Something happened in the Red Building?

780
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,680
Mr. Hu Shi wrote a proposal about moving Peking University

781
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,360
to Shanghai.

782
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,400
Himself and

783
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
Fu Sinian, Luo Jialun went to mimeograph.

784
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
We have been waiting for them to finish printing.

785
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,880
What?

786
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,800
Proposal for moving Peking University to Shanghai?

787
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,080
Who initiated it?

788
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,920
I took a copy for you to have a look.

789
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
Did Hu Shi take the wrong medicine?

790
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,160
What's he thinking?

791
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,120
Such an important matter.

792
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
Why he didn't discuss it with me?

793
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000
Move Peking University to Shanghai.

794
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,200
What's this nonsense?

795
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
Things here in Beijing has just begun to see the light.

796
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,560
Is he tearing it down?

797
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,120
Yannian.

798
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
Go get him for me.

799
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,360
In the middle of the night, you called someone to lecture.

800
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,480
It's not appropriate.

801
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,880
It's literally the practice of feudal paternalism.

802
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
Just do as I say.

803
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,480
Stop this nonsense.

804
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,560
It's people's freedom to have a proposal and to print articles.

805
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,600
You can disagree.

806
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
But you have no right to interfere with people's freedom.

807
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,400
He's making it hard for all of us.

808
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,760
Why can't I interfere?

809
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,720
Are you going or not?

810
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,360
I won't go.

811
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,120
He is a professor at Peking University like you,

812
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,080
not your sidekick.

813
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,960
Why should he listen?

814
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,480
Isn't it too hurtful of you to do so?

815
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,120
Fine.

816
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,560
I don't need you.

817
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,840
I'll go by myself

818
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,720
Get out of the way.

819
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,080
Uncle Chen, don't be angry.

820
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,360
Yannian is for your own good.

821
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,720
Yannian is just worried.

822
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
If it gets ugly between you and Uncle Hu,

823
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
it will affect the student movement.

824
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,040
It will hurt you even more.

825
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,840
What does he know?

826
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,160
This is shaking the army's morale.

827
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,680
Pulling the last straw!

828
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,160
Let's start.

829
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
Sir

830
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,040
Where is Shizhi?

831
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Why are you here, Mr. Chen?

832
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,720
Professor Hu has gone home.

833
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,840
Where are you going?

834
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,280
His house.

835
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
Why you going his house?

836
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,760
They have a newborn at home.

837
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,960
I want to ask him.

838
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,960
Why does Hu Shi want to be a traitor?

839
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,280
Come.

840
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,920
Let's sit down and talk.

841
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,400
Come.

842
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:20,880
Sit down.

843
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:21,680
Come.

844
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,880
I can't.

845
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,040
Look at what's written here.

846
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,320
Do you know?

847
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,600
The result of Shizhi doing this?

848
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,040
Division!

849
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,320
Mr. Zhongfu.

850
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,920
Mr. Hu is doing so for a good cause.

851
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,400
He doesn't want the government-

852
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,280
Stupid!

853
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,520
We are the frontline, by doing this

854
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,520
only leads to break the morale and divert attention.

855
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,800
It's helping the traitors.

856
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,200
As a result, it is inevitable that we will suffer and the enemy will laugh.

857
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,760
Sir.

858
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,400
This kind of flyer

859
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,440
not even one can be seen.

860
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,440
Destroy them all, all of them!

861
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,160
Sir.

862
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,160
We really need to talk to Mr. Hu about this.

863
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
We can't bear this responsibility.

864
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,920
You don't have. I'm responsible for this.

865
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
You are only responsible for take Hu Shi here for me.

866
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
Brother Zhongfu, don't be so impulsive, okay?

867
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
If I don't be impulsive,

868
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,560
our hard-earned revolutionary achievements

869
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,760
is all going to be destroyed.

870
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,760
China, even the whole world now

871
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
are looking at our Peking University.

872
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,600
They are all watching.

873
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,160
Moving Peking University at this time

874
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,800
is to blow the candle and kill the revolution.

875
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,160
Such a simple truth.

876
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,360
Can't you see clearly?

877
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,360
Do you want to be Zhang Zongxiang, Cao Rulin

878
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,320
or Lu Zongyu?

879
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,400
Or do you want to help the Japanese?

880
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,600
Hurry up and have Mr. Shizhi here.

881
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,080
Yes.

882
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,280
Let's talk inside.

883
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,280
Move out, destroy, move out.

884
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,720
Destroy it all.

885
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,760
Let's talk.

886
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,480
Move!

887
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,520
Liu Mei, any dried one?

888
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,120
Yeah, I'll bring it to you later.

889
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,680
Qiaonian.

890
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
Take this printed one away quickly.

891
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:57,920
One second.

892
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
How's it going? Close to finish?

893
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,480
Mrs. Chen.

894
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,040
Auntie.

895
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,680
Auntie.

896
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,640
Have some porridge.

897
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,040
My hands are too dirty.

898
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,840
I won't help you this time.

899
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,000
It's okay. I brought a handkerchief.

900
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,360
Clean then eat.

901
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,040
It's okay.

902
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,920
We're almost done.

903
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,040
Your Dad, what can I do about him.

904
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,480
He's not coming back this late at night,

905
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,920
but keeps you guys busying until now.

906
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,080
I'm used to that already.

907
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,240
But he doesn't have the right to treat Uncle Hu like that today.

908
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,840
So bossy.

909
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,720
That's who he is, your Dad.

910
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,800
Overly confident and a control freak.

911
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,480
Nobody can manage him.

912
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,720
I'm used to him offending people everywhere.

913
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
But you have to believe,

914
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,080
your father didn't do it for himself.

915
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,600
He did it for everyone.

916
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,160
His heart is full of bigger things.

917
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,080
I understand all of this.

918
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
But he always has this temper.

919
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,880
How can it work?

920
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,560
I have read a western proverb.

921
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Habit determines character, character determines fate.

922
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,120
He will suffer a big loss sooner or later.

923
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,120
Yannian.

924
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,720
Sometimes,

925
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,280
I really think you are so much like your father.

926
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,120
You two always are against each other.

927
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,840
Auntie.

928
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm nowhere as blunt as he is.

929
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,440
Shouchang,

930
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,080
I really can't understand.

931
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
Why did Shizhi do this?

932
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
Why would he?

933
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,120
Actually, before Yannian came,

934
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,720
Shizhi and I have already argued.

935
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,320
He has his ideas.

936
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,600
He is afraid that the Beiyang government will take the ruthless way

937
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
and disband Peking University

938
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,000
and arrest you and me.

939
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
So he said he was thinking for you.

940
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
Thinking for me.

941
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,160
What does that mean?

942
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
He feels that Peking University has made too many enemies now.

943
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,600
And get caught deeply in the current political vortex.

944
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,360
If there is one spark ignites,

945
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,680
Peking University will be ruined.

946
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,120
And we'll be ruined.

947
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,520
He said it wasn't easy for us to get here today.

948
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,040
We can't lose it all.

949
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,800
So he felt that at this time

950
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,320
moving Peking University to Shanghai,

951
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,160
stay away from all the trouble,

952
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,680
then we and Peking University will be relieved.

953
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,120
That's what he said?

954
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,200
This is his story.

955
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,440
To me, he is wrong.

956
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,320
Where he stands and the angle he takes to look at this are wrong.

957
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,440
The relationship between the fate of a country and an individual is turned upside down.

958
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,040
What is his stands and angle?

959
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,000
What perspective?

960
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,080
He thinks that Peking University should be

961
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,440
and only be a place of academic study.

962
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
It should not be mixed with politics.

963
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,880
Diplomatic disputes

964
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,000
national interests,

965
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,960
at the end of the day, all these are the government's business.

966
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,680
We can express our opinions,

967
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,600
but we have our own duty to practice.

968
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
I refuted him explicitly just now.

969
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
National sovereignty and interests are above all else.

970
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
Primary and secondary interests cannot be mixed.

971
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,440
Now is the crucial moment to boycott the Paris Peace Treaty.

972
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
At this specific time,

973
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
moving Peking University is nothing else but running away.

974
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,560
I just can't imagine this.

975
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,120
A year ago, he was a hero.

976
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,600
A former anti-feudal fighter.

977
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,600
In a flash, he becomes

978
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,560
this counsellor who hesitates on every move.

979
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,000
This kind of spirit he shows

980
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,440
disqualifies him as the coach to the youths.

981
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,000
This can't be, Shouchang.

982
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,040
I'm going to find him.

983
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
I want to pull him back.

984
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
I introduced him to Peking University.

985
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,800
Brother Zhongfu.

986
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,080
I can't leave him like this.

987
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,640
Brother Zhongfu.

988
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
Fu Sinian has already gone.

989
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,880
Brother Zhongfu.

990
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,360
Didn't Fu Sinian already go?

991
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
You don't have to be so impulsive

992
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,760
It's the same for us to wait here.

993
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,200
What if you did something you would regret?

994
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,120
You are angry.

995
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,640
Shouchang.

996
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,400
Go back to the office and close the door.

997
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,280
Shizhi.

998
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,600
I had your proposal and signature letter

999
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,480
all torn up.

1000
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,280
Do you know?

1001
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Yes.

1002
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
Fu Sinian has already told me.

1003
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,200
Burn the proposal and letters

1004
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,480
as you want.

1005
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,880
Even if you are burning down my home,

1006
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
I will not be angry at you.

1007
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,520
Why?

1008
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,000
First, you are my teacher.

1009
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,360
My brother.

1010
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,120
Second, you knew

1011
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
it's safer to leave now

1012
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,160
than to stay.

1013
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
You still burned it anyway.

1014
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,080
You did this

1015
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,560
entirely out of the great interests of the country and the nation.

1016
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,240
It's virtuous.

1017
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,160
How can I be angry?

1018
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,040
So you changed your mind?

1019
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,560
Not angry is different from changing mind.

1020
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,960
Fine.

1021
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,400
First,

1022
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,400
Shizhi, I want to thank you for thinking for me.

1023
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,600
But let me ask you something.

1024
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,960
Now hundreds of thousands of students across the country

1025
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,720
they are on the move.

1026
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,880
All China is in solidarity with Peking University.

1027
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,760
At this time, you proposed to move Peking University.

1028
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,960
Peking University is gone.

1029
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,640
The center of the movement is gone.

1030
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,600
Everyone's effort goes wasted.

1031
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,840
Guo Xingang died for nothing.

1032
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,000
No one can stop the Paris Peace Treaty anymore.

1033
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,680
Have you ever thought about it?

1034
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,280
Of course I have.

1035
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,400
But now the Beiyang government has put pressure onto us.

1036
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,560
Classes must be resumed within three days.

1037
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
If classes don't resume, we will be forcibly dissolved.

1038
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,520
Let me ask you something too.

1039
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,200
The dissolution and relocation of Peking University

1040
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400
Among these two,

1041
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,600
which one is more advantageous?

1042
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
This Peking University in China,

1043
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
this first-class university in China.

1044
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,840
Why does it have to dissolve when Beiyang government says so?

1045
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,440
If Peking University is disbanded,

1046
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,600
ask the Chinese people if they will agree.

1047
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,480
Ask teachers and students,

1048
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,080
will they accept that?

1049
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,200
Shizhi,

1050
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,880
when did you become

1051
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,880
an obedient sheep of Beiyang government?

1052
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,720
Brother Zhongfu.

1053
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,240
Now that you've put it here.

1054
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm no longer concealing my feelings.

1055
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
I returned to China from America two years ago

1056
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,960
in order to contribute to the new culture.

1057
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,400
At that time, you said that

1058
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,840
no talking about politics for twenty years,

1059
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,920
devoting yourself in inspiring people's minds.

1060
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,320
I think that exactly is the way

1061
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,080
the fundamental way for a scholar to love and save the nation.

1062
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,520
Along that path,

1063
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,360
every one of us in New Youth,

1064
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,400
we made concerted efforts.

1065
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,800
we made the New Culture Movement flourish.

1066
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,600
We changed the once-lifeless old Peking University

1067
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,040
We brought it alive again.

1068
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,560
But then you changed.

1069
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
You said the New Culture Movement could not be separated from politics.

1070
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
You even said the New Culture Movement

1071
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,080
it is politics in itself.

1072
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,640
What I want is not only Peking University to flourish.

1073
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,600
What I want is China to flourish.

1074
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
We can't get by not talking, not arguing, not fighting.

1075
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,240
What you said, what you want.

1076
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,240
I can understand and I support it.

1077
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,960
So,

1078
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,840
the May Fourth Movement,

1079
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,200
students marching in the streets

1080
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,400
opposing the Paris Peace Treaty.

1081
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
I sincerely support them.

1082
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,680
In Shanghai,

1083
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,280
I was with Yannian and the others.

1084
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,880
I attended the demonstration in person.

1085
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,240
But it's different now.

1086
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,960
Students don't attend classes, professors don't teach.

1087
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
All schools in Beijing have gone on strike.

1088
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,520
Everyone has gone to politics.

1089
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
The whole society is in chaos, brother Zhongfu.

1090
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,840
Is this what you hope for?

1091
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
Is this the kind of flourishing you want?

1092
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,840
We can't sit and wait for that to come, Shizhi.

1093
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,440
We have to fight for it.

1094
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,560
There's no making without breaking.

1095
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,280
China now needs warriors and fighters.

1096
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,280
Why do we Chinese can do nothing but just watch

1097
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
the Paris Peace Treaty get signed.

1098
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,440
Why should we just watch the loss of Qingdao happening.

1099
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,800
Giving it away to the Japanese without even arguing?

1100
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,560
Are we Chinese farm animals?

1101
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
Shall we just wait for the knives to fall?

1102
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,600
Certainly not.

1103
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,920
Shall we just get slaughtered like farm animals?

1104
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,960
Certainly not.

1105
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm not advocating not to fight.

1106
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
I mean, we can't act foolhardy.

1107
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Our power is limited.

1108
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,400
We should know how to stay away from the mess

1109
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,360
and protect ourselves.

1110
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,120
The reason why I proposed to move Peking University

1111
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,160
to Shanghai.

1112
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,720
I want to keep Peking University untouched

1113
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,160
where we have the campus,

1114
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,200
where we can still have the classes.

1115
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,920
That's all.

1116
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,960
That is a compromise.

1117
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,960
It's surrender.

1118
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
The reason why China is so timid now.

1119
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,840
We do not have enough people like Guo Xingang.

1120
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,680
We have too many people like Hu Shi.
