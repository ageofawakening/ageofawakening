00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,120


706
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,960


707
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,040

00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,320

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480

716
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:11,418
[Changxindian, Beijing]

717
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,320
Shuanzi! Happy New Year!

718
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,520
Happy New Year!

719
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,320
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

720
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,920
Go to Shugui's house for dumplings later.

721
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,480
Mr. Shouchang!

722
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,240
Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

723
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,120
Tell your kids to eat dumplings at Shugui's house.

724
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,400
Excellent!

725
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,520
Happy New Year!

726
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,560
Happy New Year!

727
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,680
I'll go later, brother.

728
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,360
There is everything there.

729
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,480
Happy New Year!

730
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,040
Today's New Year's Day!

731
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,320
Let's go to Shugui's house to eat dumplings.

732
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,000
Come to my master's house. Come to my master's house.

733
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,800
Best wishes for the New Year!

734
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,360
Happy New Year!

735
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,160
Happy New Year!

736
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,680
Let's go to Shugui's house to eat dumplings.

737
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,640
Master! My lady! (=master's wife)

738
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,200
Shugui!

739
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,000
Mr. Dazhao is here!

740
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,960
Shugui!

741
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,000
Brother!

742
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,640
Shugui!

743
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,240
Mr. Dazhao, why are you here?

744
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
Happy New Year, brothers and sisters.

745
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,600
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

746
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,520
Mr. Dazhao, why are you here?

747
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,960
Let's not talk about this.

748
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,360
Move these New Year goods quickly. Come on.

749
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,160
Come, greet everyone.

750
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,960
Zhuzi!

751
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,000
Greet everyone quickly.

752
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
Give me a hand. Give me a hand. Get in the house.

753
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,680
Mr. Dazhao,

754
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,960
why did you buy so many things?

755
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
I read in the "Morning Post"

756
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,160
that the workers in Changxindian can't get their salaries.

757
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,120
As soon as I saw it,

758
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
I got the New Year goods ready and sent them to you.

759
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,560
Mr. Shouchang has been paid this month's salary

760
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,280
and just spend it all.

761
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,000
Don't say that.

762
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,680
Mr. Cai deducted thirty yuan from me

763
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,480
and sent it to our family.

764
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,920
Mr. Dazhao,

765
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,480
how can sister-in-law and children celebrate the Spring Festival?

766
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,680
I've arranged everything.

767
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,120
Let's spend New Year's Eve together.

768
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,400
Then I will accompany them.

769
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,520
Zhuzi! Zhuzi!

770
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,720
Come and give me the noodles.

771
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,760
Give me a hand.

772
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,520
Okay, okay.

773
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,040
Here, the noodles.

774
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,920
Can you handle it?

775
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,560
One more!

776
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,360
Come back!

777
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,480
One more!

778
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,440
Okay, okay, okay.

779
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,040
Put it up here.

780
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,080
Put it up here.

781
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,760
Mr. Shouchang!

782
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
It's alright!

783
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,440
Slow down. Don't spill! Don't spill!

784
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,960
Come, come.

785
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,289
Come! Come and eat dumplings.

786
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:50,201
Come and eat dumplings.

787
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,320
Chen Zhongfu!

788
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,840
What's wrong with you?

789
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,800
You're not like other people.

790
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
There's a fire in this room. Warm and cozy.

791
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,680
You don't write in there.

792
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,960
You have to go outside

793
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,000
and write in the snow and ice.

794
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,280
You don't understand!

795
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,680
I'm writing outside in a good mood, with the good air.

796
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,280
Timely snow augurs a good harvest!

797
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
Duxiu's Spring Festival couplets!

798
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,120
A great blend of scenery and sentiment.

799
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Writing outside,

800
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,560
this hand doesn't shake.

801
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,156
Doesn't shake.

802
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:23,327
A frozen radish still doesn't shake.

803
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,240
Dad! Dad!

804
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,720
Yes?

805
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,280
Dad!

806
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,000
Dad!

807
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,840
Slow down, slow down.

808
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,960
You two slow down, slow down.

809
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,920
Don't fall.

810
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Dad, Yannian and Qiaonian

811
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,480
gave us pigeons.

812
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,920
Give it a name!

813
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,880
Give a name?

814
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
Thick white clouds float in the air, staining the grass and weeds.

815
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
Just call it Baiyun (=White cloud).

816
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,920
Call it Yingying.

817
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,440
Yingying!

818
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,091
It can also be called Yingying.

819
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,080
Yingying!

820
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,640
Yingying!

821
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,680
You're Yingying!

822
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,800
Yingying!

823
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:51,920
You're Yingying!

824
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,320
Careful!

825
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,280
See! It's on top!

826
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,760
Look at the words your dad just wrote.

827
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
There's the footprint.

828
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,640
Brother Zhongfu, just one more paper sheet.

829
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,400
No writing, no writing again.

830
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
This is Yingying announcing

831
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
that it has officially become a member of this family.

832
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,400
A swan's footprints (=traces of the past) is a good omen.

833
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,000
Qiaonian, Yannian.

834
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,200
Post your dad's couplet

835
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,000
at the gate later.

836
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,800
Alright.

837
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,760
Come, come.

838
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,002
Go, set off fireworks.

839
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:16,111
Let's go to the fireworks!

840
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,360
Come, children.

841
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
At the beginning of the New Year, I'd like to say a few words.

842
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,000
This was a good year.

843
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,000
At the beginning of the year, I felt that there were six joys.

844
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,360
The first joy

845
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,840
is that all the children have come back from Shanghai

846
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,280
with Shizhi, Bai Lan, Xingang, and Liu Mei.

847
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,600
For the first time in many years,

848
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,440
there are so many people in our family.

849
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,840
to celebrate the New Year together.

850
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,120
Not easy.

851
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,480
The second joy

852
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,440
is Shizhi's wedding.

853
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
Thirteen years of long-distance running

854
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,000
from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China,

855
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
experienced two restorations, and finally reached a happy ending.

856
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,560
What a legendary story.

857
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,760
Yes, Shizhi.

858
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,440
But I heard that when Professor Huang Kan

859
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
made your wedding

860
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,280
into lesson plans in class,

861
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,960
it made the whole classroom laugh.

862
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,320
That's Huang Kan making fun of Shizhi,

863
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,520
I didn't expect it to backfire.

864
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
Instead, it was publicity for Shizhi.

865
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,040
I really don't care.

866
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,040
If I can really become the target of the New Culture,

867
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,400
it will be my honor.

868
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,480
Uncle Chen, what about the third joy?

869
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
The third joy is naturally you young people.

870
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
The French study hall has finally been built.

871
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,920
Although the nature of your studies was temporary,

872
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,040
I finally got you

873
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,640
from Shanghai to Beijing.

874
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,280
Beijing is the center of Greater China.

875
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,240
It can improve your quality of life here.

876
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,760
The fourth joy?

877
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,840
The fourth joy is meatballs.

878
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,720
Big meatballs.

879
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,320
The circulation of our "New Youth"

880
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,000
has exceeded 10,000 copies

881
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
since peer editing was implemented,

882
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,160
and it is still increasing rapidly.

883
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
What does this mean?

884
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
The wave of the New Culture is coming.

885
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,720
Shizhi, our efforts have not been in vain.

886
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
Great!

887
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,560
The fifth joy!

888
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,440
The October Revolution took place in Russia last year.

889
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,040
The Bolshevik Party,

890
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,960
according to Marx's socialist theory,

891
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,800
led armed insurrections

892
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
and established the world's first

893
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,160
socialist country.

894
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,880
I read their program and was very inspired.

895
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
It is likely to be our role model.

896
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,760
We should study the Russian path carefully.

897
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
Don't move all foreign things

898
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,760
to your home, okay?

899
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,760
Fine, the sixth joy

900
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,840
is our Red Building.

901
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,360
It's about to open soon.

902
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
Mr. Cai has accepted the advice of Mr. Zhongfu

903
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,200
and Mr. Shouchang

904
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,880
to build an open space

905
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,400
in our Red Building library

906
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,120
and hold a reading club with the cultural youth

907
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,800
outside the school to learn together.

908
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,000
Qiaonian, Yannian,

909
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,200
Liu Mei, Bai Lan.

910
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,880
You can all come to this reading club.

911
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,160
We can also participate?

912
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,880
Of course!

913
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,760
That's great!

914
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,960
Good!

915
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,440
Great!

916
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,480
The sixth joy!

917
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,240
Wasn't the sixth joy

918
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,840
said by everyone and Shizhi?

919
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
Well, it was the same thing anyways.

920
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,640
So be it.

921
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Everyone stick Spring Festival couplets. Let's eat!

922
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,440
Let's eat!

923
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:57,920
Let's eat!

924
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,040
Come, come, open the table.

925
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,640
Put it in the pigeon cage.

926
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,400
Zimei, Henian!

927
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,680
Go wash your hands with Mom.

928
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,560
On New Year's Eve, snowflakes floated home,

929
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,640
and Li Dazhao, the noble man, came.

930
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,960
Li Dazhao!

931
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,480
The pork and cabbage dumplings

932
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,760
are cheerful and festive!

933
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
Great!

934
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,040
Great singing!

935
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,760
Great!

936
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,960
Shugui, you can sing!

937
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,280
You can sing even the Laoting drum in our hometown.

938
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Just these two voices.

939
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,400
Let me help.

940
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,160
How about I give you all a piece?

941
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
Yeah!

942
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,800
Do it!

943
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,520
Let's hear it!

944
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,560
Just once! Just once!

945
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:48,400
Wrapped in silver, full of guests

946
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,720
on New Year's Eve.

947
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,920
Talking about family life.

948
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,520
Asking the locals. Why is it so lively?

949
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,480
The fellow villagers are all good neighbors.

950
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,320
Great!

951
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,560
That was amazing!

952
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Great! Great!

953
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,840
Dumplings are done!

954
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,040
Come and eat dumplings.

955
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,200
Have a dumpling first, sir.

956
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:21,920
Hot dumpling just out of the pot.

957
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,720
Give it to the children quickly.

958
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,040
Sir, have one first.

959
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,480
I know. Give it to the children first.

960
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
You sent so many things all the way.

961
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,280
If it weren't for you,

962
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,320
none of us would have lived this year.

963
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,120
Not at all.

964
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,000
Give it to the children first.

965
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,760
Daughter-in-law, listen to Mr. Dazhao.

966
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,200
Let the children eat first.

967
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,200
Children, eat dumplings!

968
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,480
Is it too hot?

969
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,320
Too hot?

970
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,920
Here, eat dumplings!

971
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,760
Ma, you eat.

972
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,000
Daughter-in-law, why are you crying for the New Year?

973
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,000
What's the matter, sister?

974
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,720
The dumpling also let out the tears.

975
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm happy.

976
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,000
Ma, is it tasty?

977
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,200
It's tasty, son!

978
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,560
Give the dumplings to everyone quickly.

979
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,000
Put it down.

980
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,600
You don't know.

981
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Before you came, you had a problem with me.

982
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
Say it, I've never

983
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
had such a good day since my wedding.

984
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,480
On this New Year's Day,

985
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,160
I've never eaten more than a few dumplings.

986
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
Look at our work sheds.

987
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,680
Which family has white flour?

988
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,120
Here! Here!

989
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,280
I'm telling you,

990
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,880
the rich call it New Year

991
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,560
The poor call it another day to survive.

992
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,920
Actually, I think so too.

993
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,280
It's not impossible

994
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,000
for us workers to have a good life.

995
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
Mr. Dazhao, what do you mean?

996
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,440
Will we be able to eat

997
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,360
dumplings whenever we want?

998
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes!

999
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,680
Do you know there is a person called Marx?

1000
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,960
Don't know.

1001
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,480
Who?

1002
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,200
German. Big beard.

1003
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,320
Ever heard of him?

1004
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,440
Don't you have a beard?

1005
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,440
His beard is a lot bigger than mine!

1006
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,560
Let me tell you something.

1007
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,480
Marx has a view

1008
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,400
that the working class

1009
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
is the leader of human society.

1010
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,960
Only the society led by our working class

1011
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,920
is the most advanced society in the world.

1012
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,360
Is it?

1013
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,120
The most advanced society.

1014
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,120
This Marx said that the workers are leaders.

1015
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,080
Impossible.

1016
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,840
How can we workers be leaders?

1017
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,960
What impossible?

1018
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,640
In Russia, there is a man called Lenin

1019
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,880
who based himself on this viewpoint and theory.

1020
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,600
The people overthrew the bourgeois government.

1021
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,360
I know Russia is just north of us.

1022
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
The emperor of Russia is called the Tsar

1023
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,800
and not Emperor.

1024
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,480
It's Tsar, without the "di".

1025
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,840
It sounds like "bean paste stuffing".

1026
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,880
Tsar!

1027
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,560
After the fall of the Tsar,

1028
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,080
Lenin led the people

1029
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
through armed uprising

1030
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
and overthrew the bourgeois provisional government,

1031
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,920
and then set up the first country

1032
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,640
led by the working class in human history,

1033
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,560
which is called a socialist country

1034
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,480
and also called the Soviet Union.

1035
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
A Soviet is a representative council.

1036
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,400
A Soviet authority

1037
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
is an assembly of representatives of workers, peasants and soldiers.

1038
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,520
Right, what Shiyan said is correct.

1039
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,440
After the establishment of this government,

1040
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,360
the people did two things,

1041
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,880
two decrees were issued.

1042
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,480
The first

1043
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,160
-- I'll take this --

1044
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
is to announce that they will not participate in the World War.

1045
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,560
They don't play with them anymore!

1046
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,920
How did you know that?

1047
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
Just don't play with them!

1048
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
Don't play with these imperialists.

1049
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,120
The second

1050
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,720
-- everyone will be interested in hearing this --

1051
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,160
Say it!

1052
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,960
Say it!

1053
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,920
Sir, don't just talk!

1054
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,800
Drink a bowl of water.

1055
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,640
I'll drink some water.

1056
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,680
Don't leave us in suspense.

1057
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,400
Right!

1058
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,640
This second thing is

1059
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
the land is yours.

1060
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,400
The land is yours.

1061
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,440
The land is yours!

1062
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,440
It's all ours!

1063
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
Think about it. The land belongs to us.

1064
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,920
Is it still difficult for us to have a good life?

1065
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,280
We can be masters of our homes!

1066
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah!

1067
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,680
We can be masters of our own lives in the future.

1068
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,720
Mr. Dazhao,

1069
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,680
in this socialist country you just mentioned,

1070
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,027
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

1071
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
does it mean that people no longer exploit people

1072
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,720
and no one bully us poor people?

1073
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
Exactly, that's what it means.

1074
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,840
Then do you have the bearded man you mentioned

1075
