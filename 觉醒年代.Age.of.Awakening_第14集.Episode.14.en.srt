My apologies, everybody,

I have a guest from my hometown here.

How about we continue next time?

We haven't fully enjoyed our discussion yet, how come it's over now?

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
can we say goodbye to you in the Western manner?

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,680

You must be just arriving.

They're members of my poetry club in Beijing.

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
And they're here to discuss vernacular poetry with me.

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,600
No wonder your mother was so worried about you.

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Excuse me?

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,960
Your mother had a letter sent to me

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,120
saying that back in your hometown,

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440

57

So was your mother.

60
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,600
Therefore, they asked me to persuade you

61

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
You should think it over.

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680

69

70

Right!

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
But then, you guys are even talking about "vitamins",

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,440

seen many people who were starved to death.

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
In these few days when we're staying at the inn,

178
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
he kept moving into new rooms.

179
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
But still he can't sleep at all,

180
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,800
as he was horrified that somebody would kill him.

This morning,

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,600
he insisted on coming to you

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
and that those people are after him again.

184
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
It seems that he's having a psychosis.

185
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
Let's take him to a hospital first.

186

You tell me now, why do you want me dead?

Why are you trying to kill me?

Why kill me?!

Great! Now Shizhi is back to his hometown for his wedding.

As for this list of wedding gifts,

225
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
you guys should make several copies of it

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,680

229
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
It's essentially a notice of appeasement.

230
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,400
On one hand, it's a notice to the slanderers

231
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,080
asking them to cut the gossips.

232
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,000
On the other hand,

233
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
it's for the female poetry club members who are hankering after him,

234
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,280

How so?

239
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,960
Why though?

240
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
We should save some opportunities for the female poetry club members.

What, mutton? I'll make some noodles for lunch.

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,960
No way.

341
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,480
It's good to eat some meat.

342
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
They're growing kids.

343
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,320
How can noodles compare to meat?

00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,840
Xinghua, Boahua,

345
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,320
Do you want to eat meat?

346

Or do you want to eat noodles?

347

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,680
once your section is done,

352
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
the kang-bed will be pretty much finished.

353
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,280
You've worked hard.

354
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,240
It's nothing, Auntie.

355
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,440
Once the clay in the kang has been heated,

356
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,400
you just need another layer.

357
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,360
You'll be able to use it after it dries.

358
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,160
Great.

359
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,040
Mr. Shouchang, we finished building the kang.

360
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
If there isn't anything else, I'll be getting back.

361
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,760
Why?

362
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,200
Didn't we agree?

363
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,400
To welcome your Auntie

365
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,800
That's right.

366
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,560
I won't interrupt your family reunion.

367
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
My father's still at home. I can't leave him.

368
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,880
I forgot.

369
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,560
Give me a minute.

370
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,720
Eat before you leave.

371
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,320
No, Auntie. I've still got things to take care of at home.

372
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,920
His father is sick. He needs to get back.

373
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
Here, Xiaoshan.

374
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,400
I can't accept this, sir.

375
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,360
Take it, take it.

376
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,640
Auntie, I can't accept this money.

377
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,840
Why not?

378
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,040
It's just a small token of my appreciation.

379
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,760
Take it.

380
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,680
Go.

381
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,880
Go.

382
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,760
Thank you, sir. Thank you, auntie.

383
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,960
Go.

384
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,080
Go wash your hands.

385
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,720
Father, we've changed. Let's go eat instant-pot mutton.

386
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,600
Good.

387
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
You've changed your clothes but your little faces are still grubby.

388
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,720
Come here.

389
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,880
Wash your faces and hands.

390
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,320
Nice and clean when we go out to eat.

391
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,920
Nice and clean.

392
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,960
I'll go get changed.

393
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,360
We'll leave once I change.

394
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,400
Mr. Shouchang.

395
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,080
Please come in.

396
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,680
Mr. Shouchang.

397
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,720
Come in, come in.

398
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,840
Here, come in.

399
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,720
Sir.

400
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
How did you know I moved here?

401
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,360
Hello, sir.

402
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,880
Sir.

403
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,880
Sir, the dean's office told us.

404
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,480
You've just moved in.

405
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
And here we are, suddenly visiting.

406
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,080
Excuse us.

407
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,480
It's true.

408
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,040
We've disturbed you.

409
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,080
What disturbance?

410
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,680
You're welcomed to come often.

411
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,480
Just so happens my wife is here.

412
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Wife, this is Zhong Xie and Hai Wei.

413
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
Two students of mine.

414
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,280
Hello mistress. Hello mistress.

415
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
Hello.

416
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Hello.

417
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,400
Hello.

418
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,880
Didn't know that the mistress just got here.

419
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,040
We apologize for our sudden visit.

420
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,760
Not at all, not at all.

421
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,600
Sit down and chat. No problem.

422
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,520
Here, come this way.

423
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,840
What's happened?

424
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,560
We didn't know the mistress would come today.

425
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,760
Very rude of us.

426
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
Actually it's not a big deal.

427
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
Let's go. We'll call on you another day.

428
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,240
Come back, come back.

429
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
Speak your mind. There must be a reason you came to visit.

430
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,920
What's going on?

431
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
Then I'll get to the point.

432
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,680
It's like this.

433
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
Hai Wei has some problems with his tuition this semester.

434
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,440
He hasn't received the money sent from back home.

435
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
So the dean's office has asked him to write an IOU.

436
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
But he needs a teacher to be a guarantor.

437
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
So I said, why don't you find Mr. Shouchang.

438
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,040
But Hai Wei is thin skinned.

439
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
He's embarrassed.

440
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,320
That's why I brought him along.

441
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,480
Hai wei,

442
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,840
this is nothing.

443
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
Do you really need to be embarrassed?

444
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,600
It's just being a guarantor.

445
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,960
I'll do it.

446
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,280
How much do you owe?

447
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
A deposit for five silver dollars.

448
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,480
Why bother being a guarantor?

449
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll give it to you.

450
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,880
No need, sir.

451
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,320
I'll give it to you.

452
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,960
Uh.

453
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,800
Uh, this won't do.

454
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,200
Uh.

455
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

456
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,520
The travel expenses you gave me last time.

457
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,800
There's three silver dollars left.

458
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,240
Give it to them.

459
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,040
Let's go, let's go.

460
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
Sir, we're going to get going.

461
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,520
Come back, come back.

462
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,440
Come.

463
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,560
Don't go running off.

464
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,360
Go pay.

465
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:07,840
Sir.

466
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,760
I can't accept

467
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,440
this oney.

468
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,280
Why don't you just be my guarantor.

469
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,560
That would be

470
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,680
the greatest help.

471
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,680
Give me your hand.

472
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,640
Sir.

473
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,360
Don't dawdle.

474
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,280
Quickly go to the dean's office and pay.

475
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,160
The next semester

476
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,360
is about to start.

477
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:28,960
Zhang Xie,

478
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,920
go with him to pay.

479
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,400
Go.

480
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,360
Go.

481
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,440
The gentleman said so.

482
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Just accept it.

483
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,880
Thank you, sir. Thank you Mr. Shouchang.

484
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,320
Thank you mistress.

485
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,680
Take care.

486
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,600
We'll be on our way.

487
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,160
Father, we're ready.

488
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,600
Let's go eat mutton.

489
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,240
Instant-boiled mutton.

490
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,760
Instant-boiled mutton.

491
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
Baohua, Xinghua,

492
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,560
come.

493
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
Father needs to explain something.

494
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
The disadvantages of eating meat.

495
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,480
The most important disadvantage.

496
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,640
It gets stuck in your teeth.

497
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
And once it gets stuck in your teeth,

498
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,000
we'd have to dig it out.

499
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,480
And digging?

500
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,240
It hurts so much.

501
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:32,960
No, I uh

502
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,840
can't eat it, can't eat it.

503
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,880
I won't get food stuck in my teeth.

504
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,760
I have great teeth.

505
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,800
I want to eat meat.

506
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,720
You'll be uncomfortble when we dig it out.

507
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,600
I just want to eat meat.

508
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Back home we always eat the noodles mother make.

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,040
I'm sick of it.

510
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,160
I want to eat meat.

511
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Baohua, Xinghua,

512
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
what are you making a fuss for?

513
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
Going on about eating meat.

514
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,280
We'll stay home and eat the noodles I make.

515
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,760
Mama's angry.

516
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,880
No meat.

517
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,760
It's good to eat noodles.

518
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
You won't get noodles stuck in your teeth.

519
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,880
But I promise

520
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
I will take you two to eat instant-boiled mutton.

521
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,680
Two times.

522
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,960
Is Mr. Shouchang home?

523
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm here.

524
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,920
Hello.

525
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
Hello, madame.

526
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
Mr. Zhao, why have you come?

527
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,760
Mr. Shouchang,

528
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,720
Today I'm not here

529
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,440
to see you.

530
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm here to see the madame.

531
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,920
To see me?

532
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,840
Madame,

533
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,840
I'm here on the orders of Principal Cai Yuanpei

534
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,360
to give you you salary.

535
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
What does Mr. Cai mean by this?

536
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,920
Madame Li,

537
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,040
Mr. Cai knows

538
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
Director Li spends money like water,

539
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,720
and takes pleasure in generously helping others.

540
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,760
He spends his salary

541
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,720
on charitable deeds.

542
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,520
Therefore,

543
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,400
he decided

544
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,400
to deduct thirty silver dollars

545
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
from Mr. Shouchang's salary every month.

546
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,120
And told me to personally give it to madame

547
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,080
for household expenses.

548
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
He knew you would arrive today

549
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,600
and that Mr. Shouchang won't have any money to help you settle down.

550
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,480
So

551
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,840
he got me to quickly deliver the money.

552
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,040
You should accept it.

553
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,560
Shouchang,

554
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,640
is this appropriate?

555
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,920
It is.

556
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,200
Take it.

557
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,640
Here.

558
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,400

What is more tasty? Instant-boiled mutton?

He's publicly taped these rules by his bed

685

so that we can all help him implement it.

686
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,280

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,640
Master! My lady! (=master's wife)

746
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,200
Shugui!

747
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,000
Mr. Dazhao is here!

748
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,960
Shugui!

749
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,000
Brother!

750
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,640
Shugui!

751
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,240
Mr. Dazhao, why are you here?

752
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
Happy New Year, brothers and sisters.

753
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,600
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

754
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,520
Mr. Dazhao, why are you here?

755
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,960
Let's not talk about this.

756
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,360
Move these New Year goods quickly. Come on.

757
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,160
Come, greet everyone.

758
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,960
Zhuzi!

759
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,000
Greet everyone quickly.

760
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
Give me a hand. Give me a hand. Get in the house.

761
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,680
Mr. Dazhao,

762
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,960
why did you buy so many things?

763
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
I read in the "Morning Post"

764
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,160
that the workers in Changxindian can't get their salaries.

765
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,120
As soon as I saw it,

766
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
I got the New Year goods ready and sent them to you.

767
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,560
Mr. Shouchang has been paid this month's salary

768
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,280
and just spend it all.

769
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,000
Don't say that.

770
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,680
Mr. Cai deducted thirty yuan from me

771
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,480
and sent it to our family.

772
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,920
Mr. Dazhao,

773
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,480
how can sister-in-law and children celebrate the Spring Festival?

774
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,680
I've arranged everything.

775
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,120
Let's spend New Year's Eve together.

776
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,400
Then I will accompany them.

777
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,520
Zhuzi! Zhuzi!

778
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,720
Come and give me the noodles.

779
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,760
Give me a hand.

780
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,520
Okay, okay.

781
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,040
Here, the noodles.

782
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,920
Can you handle it?

783
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,560
One more!

784
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,360
Come back!

785
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,480
One more!

786
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,440
Okay, okay, okay.

787
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,040
Put it up here.

788
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,080
Put it up here.

789
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,760
Mr. Shouchang!

790
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
It's alright!

791
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,440
Slow down. Don't spill! Don't spill!

792
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,960
Come, come.

793
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,289
Come! Come and eat dumplings.

794
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:50,201
Come and eat dumplings.

795
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,320
Chen Zhongfu!

796
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,840
What's wrong with you?

797
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,800
You're not like other people.

798
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
There's a fire in this room. Warm and cozy.

799
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,680
You don't write in there.

800
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,960
You have to go outside

801
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,000
and write in the snow and ice.

802
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,280
You don't understand!

803
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,680
I'm writing outside in a good mood, with the good air.

804
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,280
Timely snow augurs a good harvest!

805
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
Duxiu's Spring Festival couplets!

806
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,120
A great blend of scenery and sentiment.

807
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Writing outside,

808
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,560
this hand doesn't shake.

809
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,156
Doesn't shake.

810
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:23,327
A frozen radish still doesn't shake.

811
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,240
Dad! Dad!

812
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,720
Yes?

813
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,280
Dad!

814
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,000
Dad!

815
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,840
Slow down, slow down.

816
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,960
You two slow down, slow down.

817
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,920
Don't fall.

818
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Dad, Yannian and Qiaonian

819
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,480
gave us pigeons.

820
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,920
Give it a name!

821
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,880
Give a name?

822
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
Thick white clouds float in the air, staining the grass and weeds.

823
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
Just call it Baiyun (=White cloud).

824
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,920
Call it Yingying.

825
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,440
Yingying!

826
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,091
It can also be called Yingying.

827
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,080
Yingying!

828
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,640
Yingying!

829
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,680
You're Yingying!

830
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,800
Yingying!

831
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:51,920
You're Yingying!

832
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,320
Careful!

833
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,280
See! It's on top!

834
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,760
Look at the words your dad just wrote.

835
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
There's the footprint.

836
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,640
Brother Zhongfu, just one more paper sheet.

837
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,400
No writing, no writing again.

838
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
This is Yingying announcing

839
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
that it has officially become a member of this family.

840
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,400
A swan's footprints (=traces of the past) is a good omen.

841
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,000
Qiaonian, Yannian.

842
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,200
Post your dad's couplet

843
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,000
at the gate later.

844
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,800
Alright.

845
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,760
Come, come.

846
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,002
Go, set off fireworks.

847
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:16,111
Let's go to the fireworks!

848
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,360
Come, children.

849
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
At the beginning of the New Year, I'd like to say a few words.

850
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,000
This was a good year.

851
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,000
At the beginning of the year, I felt that there were six joys.

852
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,360
The first joy

853
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,840
is that all the children have come back from Shanghai

854
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,280
with Shizhi, Bai Lan, Xingang, and Liu Mei.

855
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,600
For the first time in many years,

856
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,440
there are so many people in our family.

857
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,840
to celebrate the New Year together.

858
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,120
Not easy.

859
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,480
The second joy

860
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,440
is Shizhi's wedding.

861
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
Thirteen years of long-distance running

862
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,000
from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China,

863
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
experienced two restorations, and finally reached a happy ending.

864
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,560
What a legendary story.

865
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,760
Yes, Shizhi.

866
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,440
But I heard that when Professor Huang Kan

867
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
made your wedding

868
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,280
into lesson plans in class,

869
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,960
it made the whole classroom laugh.

870
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,320
That's Huang Kan making fun of Shizhi,

871
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,520
I didn't expect it to backfire.

872
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
Instead, it was publicity for Shizhi.

873
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,040
I really don't care.

874
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,040
If I can really become the target of the New Culture,

875
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,400
it will be my honor.

876
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,480
Uncle Chen, what about the third joy?

877
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
The third joy is naturally you young people.

878
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
The French study hall has finally been built.

879
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,920
Although the nature of your studies was temporary,

880
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,040
I finally got you

881
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,640
from Shanghai to Beijing.

882
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,280
Beijing is the center of Greater China.

883
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,240
It can improve your quality of life here.

884
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,760
The fourth joy?

885
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,840
The fourth joy is meatballs.

886
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,720
Big meatballs.

887
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,320
The circulation of our "New Youth"

888
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,000
has exceeded 10,000 copies

889
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
since peer editing was implemented,

890
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,160
and it is still increasing rapidly.

891
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
What does this mean?

892
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
The wave of the New Culture is coming.

893
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,720
Shizhi, our efforts have not been in vain.

894
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
Great!

895
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,560
The fifth joy!

896
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,440
The October Revolution took place in Russia last year.

897
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,040
The Bolshevik Party,

898
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,960
according to Marx's socialist theory,

899
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,800
led armed insurrections

900
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
and established the world's first

901
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,160
socialist country.

902
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,880
I read their program and was very inspired.

903
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
It is likely to be our role model.

904
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,760
We should study the Russian path carefully.

905
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
Don't move all foreign things

906
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,760
to your home, okay?

907
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,760
Fine, the sixth joy

908
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,840
is our Red Building.

909
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,360
It's about to open soon.

910
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
Mr. Cai has accepted the advice of Mr. Zhongfu

911
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,200
and Mr. Shouchang

912
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,880
to build an open space

913
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,400
in our Red Building library

914
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,120
and hold a reading club with the cultural youth

915
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,800
outside the school to learn together.

916
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,000
Qiaonian, Yannian,

917
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,200
Liu Mei, Bai Lan.

918
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,880
You can all come to this reading club.

919
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,160
We can also participate?

920
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,880
Of course!

921
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,760
That's great!

922
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,960
Good!

923
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,440
Great!

924
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,480
The sixth joy!

925
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,240
Wasn't the sixth joy

926
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,840
said by everyone and Shizhi?

927
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
Well, it was the same thing anyways.

928
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,640
So be it.

929
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Everyone stick Spring Festival couplets. Let's eat!

930
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,440
Let's eat!

931
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:57,920
Let's eat!

932
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,040
Come, come, open the table.

933
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,640
Put it in the pigeon cage.

934
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,400
Zimei, Henian!

935
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,680
Go wash your hands with Mom.

936
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,560
On New Year's Eve, snowflakes floated home,

937
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,640
and Li Dazhao, the noble man, came.

938
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,960
Li Dazhao!

939
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,480
The pork and cabbage dumplings

940
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,760
are cheerful and festive!

941
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
Great!

942
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,040
Great singing!

943
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,760
Great!

944
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,960
Shugui, you can sing!

945
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,280
You can sing even the Laoting drum in our hometown.

946
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Just these two voices.

947
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,400
Let me help.

948
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,160
How about I give you all a piece?

949
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
Yeah!

950
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,800
Do it!

951
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,520
Let's hear it!

952
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,560
Just once! Just once!

953
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:48,400
Wrapped in silver, full of guests

954
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,720
on New Year's Eve.

955
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,920
Talking about family life.

956
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,520
Asking the locals. Why is it so lively?

957
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,480
The fellow villagers are all good neighbors.

958
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,320
Great!

959
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,560
That was amazing!

960
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Great! Great!

961
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,840
Dumplings are done!

962
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,040
Come and eat dumplings.

963
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,200
Have a dumpling first, sir.

964
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:21,920
Hot dumpling just out of the pot.

965
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,720
Give it to the children quickly.

966
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,040
Sir, have one first.

967
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,480
I know. Give it to the children first.

968
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
You sent so many things all the way.

969
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,280
If it weren't for you,

970
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,320
none of us would have lived this year.

971
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,120
Not at all.

972
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,000
Give it to the children first.

973
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,760
Daughter-in-law, listen to Mr. Dazhao.

974
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,200
Let the children eat first.

975
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,200
Children, eat dumplings!

976
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,480
Is it too hot?

977
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,320
Too hot?

978
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,920
Here, eat dumplings!

979
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,760
Ma, you eat.

980
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,000
Daughter-in-law, why are you crying for the New Year?

981
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,000
What's the matter, sister?

982
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,720
The dumpling also let out the tears.

983
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm happy.

984
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,000
Ma, is it tasty?

985
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,200
It's tasty, son!

986
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,560
Give the dumplings to everyone quickly.

987
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,000
Put it down.

988
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,600
You don't know.

989
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Before you came, you had a problem with me.

990
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
Say it, I've never

991
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
had such a good day since my wedding.

992
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,480
On this New Year's Day,

993
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,160
I've never eaten more than a few dumplings.

994
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
Look at our work sheds.

995
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,680
Which family has white flour?

996
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,120
Here! Here!

997
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,280
I'm telling you,

998
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,880
the rich call it New Year

999
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,560
The poor call it another day to survive.

1000
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,920
Actually, I think so too.

1001
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,280
It's not impossible

1002
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,000
for us workers to have a good life.

1003
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
Mr. Dazhao, what do you mean?

1004
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,440
Will we be able to eat

1005
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,360
dumplings whenever we want?

1006
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes!

1007
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,680
Do you know there is a person called Marx?

1008
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,960
Don't know.

1009
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,480
Who?

1010
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,200
German. Big beard.

1011
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,320
Ever heard of him?

1012
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,440
Don't you have a beard?

1013
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,440
His beard is a lot bigger than mine!

1014
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,560
Let me tell you something.

1015
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,480
Marx has a view

1016
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,400
that the working class

1017
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
is the leader of human society.

1018
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,960
Only the society led by our working class

1019
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,920
is the most advanced society in the world.

1020
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,360
Is it?

1021
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,120
The most advanced society.

1022
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,120
This Marx said that the workers are leaders.

1023
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,080
Impossible.

1024
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,840
How can we workers be leaders?

1025
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,960
What impossible?

1026
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,640
In Russia, there is a man called Lenin

1027
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,880
who based himself on this viewpoint and theory.

1028
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,600
The people overthrew the bourgeois government.

1029
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,360
I know Russia is just north of us.

1030
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
The emperor of Russia is called the Tsar

1031
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,800
and not Emperor.

1032
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,480
It's Tsar, without the "di".

1033
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,840
It sounds like "bean paste stuffing".

1034
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,880
Tsar!

1035
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,560
After the fall of the Tsar,

1036
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,080
Lenin led the people

1037
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
through armed uprising

1038
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
and overthrew the bourgeois provisional government,

1039
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,920
and then set up the first country

1040
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,640
led by the working class in human history,

1041
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,560
which is called a socialist country

1042
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,480
and also called the Soviet Union.

1043
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
A Soviet is a representative council.

1044
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,400
A Soviet authority

1045
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
is an assembly of representatives of workers, peasants and soldiers.

1046
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,520
Right, what Shiyan said is correct.

1047
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,440
After the establishment of this government,

1048
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,360
the people did two things,

1049
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,880
two decrees were issued.

1050
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,480
The first

1051
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,160
-- I'll take this --

1052
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
is to announce that they will not participate in the World War.

1053
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,560
They don't play with them anymore!

1054
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,920
How did you know that?

1055
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
Just don't play with them!

1056
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
Don't play with these imperialists.

1057
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,120
The second

1058
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,720
-- everyone will be interested in hearing this --

1059
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,160
Say it!

1060
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,960
Say it!

1061
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,920
Sir, don't just talk!

1062
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,800
Drink a bowl of water.

1063
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,640
I'll drink some water.

1064
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,680
Don't leave us in suspense.

1065
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,400
Right!

1066
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,640
This second thing is

1067
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
the land is yours.

1068
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,400
The land is yours.

1069
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,440
The land is yours!

1070
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,440
It's all ours!

1071
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
Think about it. The land belongs to us.

1072
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,920
Is it still difficult for us to have a good life?

1073
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,280
We can be masters of our homes!

1074
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah!

1075
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,680
We can be masters of our own lives in the future.

1076
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,720
Mr. Dazhao,

1077
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,680
in this socialist country you just mentioned,

1078
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,027
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

1079
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
does it mean that people no longer exploit people

1080
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,720
and no one bully us poor people?

1081
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
Exactly, that's what it means.

1082
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,840
Then do you have the bearded man you mentioned

1083
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
and people like Lenin

1084
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,640
in China?

1085
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,080
Yes, let's find him.

1086
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,440
Don't worry, everyone.

1087
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,880
Now a group of people are looking for him.

1088
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,480
You are the bearded man!

1089
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,960
You are the bearded one!
