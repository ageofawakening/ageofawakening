My apologies, everybody,

I have a guest from my hometown here.

How about we continue next time?

We haven't fully enjoyed our discussion yet, how come it's over now?

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
can we say goodbye to you in the Western manner?

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,680

You must be just arriving.

They're members of my poetry club in Beijing.

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
And they're here to discuss vernacular poetry with me.

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,600
No wonder your mother was so worried about you.

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Excuse me?

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,960
Your mother had a letter sent to me

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,120
saying that back in your hometown,

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440

57

So was your mother.

60
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,600
Therefore, they asked me to persuade you

61

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
You should think it over.

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680

69

70

Right!

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
But then, you guys are even talking about "vitamins",

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,440

seen many people who were starved to death.

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
In these few days when we're staying at the inn,

178
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
he kept moving into new rooms.

179
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
But still he can't sleep at all,

180
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,800
as he was horrified that somebody would kill him.

This morning,

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,600
he insisted on coming to you

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
and that those people are after him again.

184
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
It seems that he's having a psychosis.

185
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
Let's take him to a hospital first.

186

You tell me now, why do you want me dead?

Why are you trying to kill me?

Why kill me?!

Great! Now Shizhi is back to his hometown for his wedding.

As for this list of wedding gifts,

225
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
you guys should make several copies of it

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,680

229
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
It's essentially a notice of appeasement.

230
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,400
On one hand, it's a notice to the slanderers

231
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,080
asking them to cut the gossips.

232
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,000
On the other hand,

233
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
it's for the female poetry club members who are hankering after him,

234
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,280

How so?

239
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,960
Why though?

240
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
We should save some opportunities for the female poetry club members.

242

What, mutton? I'll make some noodles for lunch.

No way.

338
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,480
It's good to eat some meat.

339
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
They're growing kids.

340
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,320
How can noodles compare to meat?

00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,840
Xinghua, Boahua,

342
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,320
Do you want to eat meat?

343

Or do you want to eat noodles?

344

Meat!

345
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,800

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,680
once your section is done,

349
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
the kang-bed will be pretty much finished.

350
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,280
You've worked hard.

351
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,240
It's nothing, Auntie.

352
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,440
Once the clay in the kang has been heated,

353
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,400
you just need another layer.

354
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,360
You'll be able to use it after it dries.

355
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,160
Great.

356
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,040
Mr. Shouchang, we finished building the kang.

357
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
If there isn't anything else, I'll be getting back.

358
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,760
Why?

359
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,200
Didn't we agree?

360
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,400
To welcome your Auntie

362
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,800
That's right.

363
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,560
I won't interrupt your family reunion.

364
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
My father's still at home. I can't leave him.

365
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,880
I forgot.

366
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,560
Give me a minute.

367
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,720
Eat before you leave.

368
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,320
No, Auntie. I've still got things to take care of at home.

369
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,920
His father is sick. He needs to get back.

370
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
Here, Xiaoshan.

371
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,400
I can't accept this, sir.

372
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,360
Take it, take it.

373
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,640
Auntie, I can't accept this money.

374
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,840
Why not?

375
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,040
It's just a small token of my appreciation.

376
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,760
Take it.

377
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,680
Go.

378
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,880
Go.

379
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,760
Thank you, sir. Thank you, auntie.

380
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,960
Go.

381
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,080
Go wash your hands.

382
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,720
Father, we've changed. Let's go eat instant-pot mutton.

383
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,600
Good.

384
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
You've changed your clothes but your little faces are still grubby.

385
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,720
Come here.

386
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,880
Wash your faces and hands.

387
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,320
Nice and clean when we go out to eat.

388
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,920
Nice and clean.

389
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,960
I'll go get changed.

390
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,360
We'll leave once I change.

391
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,400
Mr. Shouchang.

392
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,080
Please come in.

393
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,680
Mr. Shouchang.

394
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,720
Come in, come in.

395
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,840
Here, come in.

396
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,720
Sir.

397
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
How did you know I moved here?

398
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,360
Hello, sir.

399
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,880
Sir.

400
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,880
Sir, the dean's office told us.

401
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,480
You've just moved in.

402
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
And here we are, suddenly visiting.

403
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,080
Excuse us.

404
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,480
It's true.

405
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,040
We've disturbed you.

406
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,080
What disturbance?

407
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,680
You're welcomed to come often.

408
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,480
Just so happens my wife is here.

409
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Wife, this is Zhong Xie and Hai Wei.

410
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
Two students of mine.

411
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,280
Hello mistress. Hello mistress.

412
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
Hello.

413
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Hello.

414
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,400
Hello.

415
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,880
Didn't know that the mistress just got here.

416
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,040
We apologize for our sudden visit.

417
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,760
Not at all, not at all.

418
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,600
Sit down and chat. No problem.

419
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,520
Here, come this way.

420
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,840
What's happened?

421
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,560
We didn't know the mistress would come today.

422
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,760
Very rude of us.

423
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
Actually it's not a big deal.

424
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
Let's go. We'll call on you another day.

425
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,240
Come back, come back.

426
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
Speak your mind. There must be a reason you came to visit.

427
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,920
What's going on?

428
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
Then I'll get to the point.

429
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,680
It's like this.

430
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
Hai Wei has some problems with his tuition this semester.

431
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,440
He hasn't received the money sent from back home.

432
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
So the dean's office has asked him to write an IOU.

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
But he needs a teacher to be a guarantor.

434
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
So I said, why don't you find Mr. Shouchang.

435
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,040
But Hai Wei is thin skinned.

436
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
He's embarrassed.

437
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,320
That's why I brought him along.

438
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,480
Hai wei,

439
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,840
this is nothing.

440
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
Do you really need to be embarrassed?

441
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,600
It's just being a guarantor.

442
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,960
I'll do it.

443
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,280
How much do you owe?

444
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
A deposit for five silver dollars.

445
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,480
Why bother being a guarantor?

446
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll give it to you.

447
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,880
No need, sir.

448
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,320
I'll give it to you.

449
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,960
Uh.

450
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,800
Uh, this won't do.

451
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,200
Uh.

452
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

453
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,520
The travel expenses you gave me last time.

454
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,800
There's three silver dollars left.

455
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,240
Give it to them.

456
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,040
Let's go, let's go.

457
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
Sir, we're going to get going.

458
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,520
Come back, come back.

459
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,440
Come.

460
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,560
Don't go running off.

461
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,360
Go pay.

462
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:07,840
Sir.

463
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,760
I can't accept

464
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,440
this oney.

465
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,280
Why don't you just be my guarantor.

466
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,560
That would be

467
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,680
the greatest help.

468
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,680
Give me your hand.

469
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,640
Sir.

470
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,360
Don't dawdle.

471
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,280
Quickly go to the dean's office and pay.

472
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,160
The next semester

473
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,360
is about to start.

474
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:28,960
Zhang Xie,

475
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,920
go with him to pay.

476
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,400
Go.

477
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,360
Go.

478
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,440
The gentleman said so.

479
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Just accept it.

480
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,880
Thank you, sir. Thank you Mr. Shouchang.

481
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,320
Thank you mistress.

482
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,680
Take care.

483
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,600
We'll be on our way.

484
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,160
Father, we're ready.

485
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,600
Let's go eat mutton.

486
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,240
Instant-boiled mutton.

487
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,760
Instant-boiled mutton.

488
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
Baohua, Xinghua,

489
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,560
come.

490
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
Father needs to explain something.

491
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
The disadvantages of eating meat.

492
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,480
The most important disadvantage.

493
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,640
It gets stuck in your teeth.

494
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
And once it gets stuck in your teeth,

495
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,000
we'd have to dig it out.

496
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,480
And digging?

497
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,240
It hurts so much.

498
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:32,960
No, I uh

499
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,840
can't eat it, can't eat it.

500
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,880
I won't get food stuck in my teeth.

501
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,760
I have great teeth.

502
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,800
I want to eat meat.

503
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,720
You'll be uncomfortble when we dig it out.

504
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,600
I just want to eat meat.

505
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Back home we always eat the noodles mother make.

506
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,040
I'm sick of it.

507
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,160
I want to eat meat.

508
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Baohua, Xinghua,

509
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
what are you making a fuss for?

510
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
Going on about eating meat.

511
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,280
We'll stay home and eat the noodles I make.

512
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,760
Mama's angry.

513
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,880
No meat.

514
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,760
It's good to eat noodles.

515
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
You won't get noodles stuck in your teeth.

516
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,880
But I promise

517
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
I will take you two to eat instant-boiled mutton.

518
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,680
Two times.

519
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,960
Is Mr. Shouchang home?

520
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm here.

521
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,920
Hello.

522
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
Hello, madame.

523
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
Mr. Zhao, why have you come?

524
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,760
Mr. Shouchang,

525
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,720
Today I'm not here

526
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,440
to see you.

527
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm here to see the madame.

528
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,920
To see me?

529
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,840
Madame,

530
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,840
I'm here on the orders of Principal Cai Yuanpei

531
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,360
to give you you salary.

532
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
What does Mr. Cai mean by this?

533
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,920
Madame Li,

534
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,040
Mr. Cai knows

535
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
Director Li spends money like water,

536
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,720
and takes pleasure in generously helping others.

537
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,760
He spends his salary

538
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,720
on charitable deeds.

539
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,520
Therefore,

540
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,400
he decided

541
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,400
to deduct thirty silver dollars

542
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
from Mr. Shouchang's salary every month.

543
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,120
And told me to personally give it to madame

544
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,080
for household expenses.

545
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
He knew you would arrive today

546
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,600
and that Mr. Shouchang won't have any money to help you settle down.

547
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,480
So

548
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,840
he got me to quickly deliver the money.

549
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,040
You should accept it.

550
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,560
Shouchang,

551
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,640
is this appropriate?

552
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,920
It is.

553
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,200
Take it.

554
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,640
Here.

555
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,400

And no dating.

681
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
He's publicly taped these rules by his bed

682
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,040
so that we can all help him implement it.

683
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,280

What's going on?

711

It's precisely because they are not related

712

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,640
Shugui!

743
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,240
Mr. Dazhao, why are you here?

744
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
Happy New Year, brothers and sisters.

745
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,600
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

746
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,520
Mr. Dazhao, why are you here?

747
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,960
Let's not talk about this.

748
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,360
Move these New Year goods quickly. Come on.

749
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,160
Come, greet everyone.

750
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,960
Zhuzi!

751
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,000
Greet everyone quickly.

752
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
Give me a hand. Give me a hand. Get in the house.

753
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,680
Mr. Dazhao,

754
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,960
why did you buy so many things?

755
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
I read in the "Morning Post"

756
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,160
that the workers in Changxindian can't get their salaries.

757
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,120
As soon as I saw it,

758
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
I got the New Year goods ready and sent them to you.

759
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,560
Mr. Shouchang has been paid this month's salary

760
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,280
and just spend it all.

761
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,000
Don't say that.

762
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,680
Mr. Cai deducted thirty yuan from me

763
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,480
and sent it to our family.

764
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,920
Mr. Dazhao,

765
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,480
how can sister-in-law and children celebrate the Spring Festival?

766
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,680
I've arranged everything.

767
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,120
Let's spend New Year's Eve together.

768
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,400
Then I will accompany them.

769
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,520
Zhuzi! Zhuzi!

770
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,720
Come and give me the noodles.

771
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,760
Give me a hand.

772
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,520
Okay, okay.

773
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,040
Here, the noodles.

774
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,920
Can you handle it?

775
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,560
One more!

776
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,360
Come back!

777
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,480
One more!

778
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,440
Okay, okay, okay.

779
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,040
Put it up here.

780
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,080
Put it up here.

781
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,760
Mr. Shouchang!

782
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
It's alright!

783
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,440
Slow down. Don't spill! Don't spill!

784
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,960
Come, come.

785
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,289
Come! Come and eat dumplings.

786
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:50,201
Come and eat dumplings.

787
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,320
Chen Zhongfu!

788
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,840
What's wrong with you?

789
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,800
You're not like other people.

790
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
There's a fire in this room. Warm and cozy.

791
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,680
You don't write in there.

792
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,960
You have to go outside

793
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,000
and write in the snow and ice.

794
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,280
You don't understand!

795
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,680
I'm writing outside in a good mood, with the good air.

796
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,280
Timely snow augurs a good harvest!

797
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
Duxiu's Spring Festival couplets!

798
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,120
A great blend of scenery and sentiment.

799
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Writing outside,

800
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,560
this hand doesn't shake.

801
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,156
Doesn't shake.

802
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:23,327
A frozen radish still doesn't shake.

805
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,240
Dad! Dad!

806
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,720
Yes?

807
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,280
Dad!

808
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,000
Dad!

809
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,840
Slow down, slow down.

810
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,960
You two slow down, slow down.

811
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,920
Don't fall.

812
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Dad, Yannian and Qiaonian

813
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,480
gave us pigeons.

814
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,920
Give it a name!

815
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,880
Give a name?

816
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
Thick white clouds float in the air, staining the grass and weeds.

817
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
Just call it Baiyun (=White cloud).

818
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,920
Call it Yingying.

817
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,440
Yingying!

818
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,091
It can also be called Yingying.

819
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,080
Yingying!

820
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,640
Yingying!

821
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,680
You're Yingying!

822
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,800
Yingying!

823
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:51,920
You're Yingying!

824
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,320
Careful!

825
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,280
See! It's on top!

826
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,760
Look at the words your dad just wrote.

827
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
There's the footprint.

828
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,640
Brother Zhongfu, just one more paper sheet.

829
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,400
No writing, no writing again.

830
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
This is Yingying announcing

831
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
that it has officially become a member of this family.

832
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,400
A swan's footprints (=traces of the past) is a good omen.

833
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,000
Qiaonian, Yannian.

834
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,200
Post your dad's couplet

835
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,000
at the gate later.

836
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,800
Alright.

837
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,760
Come, come.

838
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,002
Go, set off fireworks.

839
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:16,111
Let's go to the fireworks!

840
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,360
Come, children.

841
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
At the beginning of the New Year, I'd like to say a few words.

842
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,000
This was a good year.

843
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,000
At the beginning of the year, I felt that there were six joys.

844
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,360
The first joy

845
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,840
is that all the children have come back from Shanghai

846
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,280
with Shizhi, Bai Lan, Xingang, and Liu Mei.

847
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,600
For the first time in many years,

848
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,440
there are so many people in our family.

849
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,840
to celebrate the New Year together.

850
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,120
Not easy.

851
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,480
The second joy

852
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,440
is Shizhi's wedding.

853
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
Thirteen years of long-distance running

854
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,000
from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China,

855
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
experienced two restorations, and finally reached a happy ending.

856
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,560
What a legendary story.

857
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,760
Yes, Shizhi.

858
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,440
But I heard that when Professor Huang Kan

859
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
made your wedding

860
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,280
into lesson plans in class,

861
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,960
it made the whole classroom laugh.

862
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,320
That's Huang Kan making fun of Shizhi,

863
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,520
I didn't expect it to backfire.

864
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
Instead, it was publicity for Shizhi.

865
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,040
I really don't care.

866
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,040
If I can really become the target of the New Culture,

867
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,400
it will be my honor.

868
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,480
Uncle Chen, what about the third joy?

869
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
The third joy is naturally you young people.

870
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
The French study hall has finally been built.

871
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,920
Although the nature of your studies was temporary,

872
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,040
I finally got you

873
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,640
from Shanghai to Beijing.

874
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,280
Beijing is the center of Greater China.

875
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,240
It can improve your quality of life here.

876
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,760
The fourth joy?

877
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,840
The fourth joy is meatballs.

878
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,720
Big meatballs.

879
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,320
The circulation of our "New Youth"

880
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,000
has exceeded 10,000 copies

881
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
since peer editing was implemented,

882
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,160
and it is still increasing rapidly.

883
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
What does this mean?

884
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
The wave of the New Culture is coming.

885
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,720
Shizhi, our efforts have not been in vain.

886
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
Great!

887
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,560
The fifth joy!

888
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,440
The October Revolution took place in Russia last year.

889
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,040
The Bolshevik Party,

890
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,960
according to Marx's socialist theory,

891
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,800
led armed insurrections

892
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
and established the world's first

893
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,160
socialist country.

894
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,880
I read their program and was very inspired.

895
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
It is likely to be our role model.

896
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,760
We should study the Russian path carefully.

897
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
Don't move all foreign things

898
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,760
to your home, okay?

899
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,760
Fine, the sixth joy

900
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,840
is our Red Building.

901
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,360
It's about to open soon.

902
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
Mr. Cai has accepted the advice of Mr. Zhongfu

903
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,200
and Mr. Shouchang

904
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,880
to build an open space

905
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,400
in our Red Building library

906
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,120
and hold a reading club with the cultural youth

907
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,800
outside the school to learn together.

908
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,000
Qiaonian, Yannian,

909
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,200
Liu Mei, Bai Lan.

910
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,880
You can all come to this reading club.

911
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,160
We can also participate?

912
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,880
Of course!

913
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,760
That's great!

914
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,960
Good!

915
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,440
Great!

916
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,480
The sixth joy!

917
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,240
Wasn't the sixth joy

918
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,840
said by everyone and Shizhi?

919
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
Well, it was the same thing anyways.

920
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,640
So be it.

921
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Everyone stick Spring Festival couplets. Let's eat!

922
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,440
Let's eat!

923
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:57,920
Let's eat!

924
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,040
Come, come, open the table.

925
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,640
Put it in the pigeon cage.

926
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,400
Zimei, Henian!

927
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,680
Go wash your hands with Mom.

928
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,560
On New Year's Eve, snowflakes floated home,

929
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,640
and Li Dazhao, the noble man, came.

930
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,960
Li Dazhao!

931
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,480
The pork and cabbage dumplings

932
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,760
are cheerful and festive!

933
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
Great!

934
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,040
Great singing!

935
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,760
Great!

936
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,960
Shugui, you can sing!

937
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,280
You can sing even the Laoting drum in our hometown.

938
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Just these two voices.

939
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,400
Let me help.

940
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,160
How about I give you all a piece?

941
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
Yeah!

942
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,800
Do it!

943
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,520
Let's hear it!

944
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,560
Just once! Just once!

945
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:48,400
Wrapped in silver, full of guests

946
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,720
on New Year's Eve.

947
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,920
Talking about family life.

948
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,520
Asking the locals. Why is it so lively?

949
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,480
The fellow villagers are all good neighbors.

950
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,320
Great!

951
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,560
That was amazing!

952
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Great! Great!

953
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,840
Dumplings are done!

954
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,040
Come and eat dumplings.

955
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,200
Have a dumpling first, sir.

956
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:21,920
Hot dumpling just out of the pot.

957
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,720
Give it to the children quickly.

958
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,040
Sir, have one first.

959
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,480
I know. Give it to the children first.

960
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
You sent so many things all the way.

961
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,280
If it weren't for you,

962
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,320
none of us would have lived this year.

963
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,120
Not at all.

964
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,000
Give it to the children first.

965
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,760
Daughter-in-law, listen to Mr. Dazhao.

966
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,200
Let the children eat first.

967
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,200
Children, eat dumplings!

968
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,480
Is it too hot?

969
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,320
Too hot?

970
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,920
Here, eat dumplings!

971
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,760
Ma, you eat.

972
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,000
Daughter-in-law, why are you crying for the New Year?

973
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,000
What's the matter, sister?

974
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,720
The dumpling also let out the tears.

975
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm happy.

976
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,000
Ma, is it tasty?

977
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,200
It's tasty, son!

978
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,560
Give the dumplings to everyone quickly.

979
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,000
Put it down.

980
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,600
You don't know.

981
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Before you came, you had a problem with me.

982
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
Say it, I've never

983
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
had such a good day since my wedding.

984
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,480
On this New Year's Day,

985
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,160
I've never eaten more than a few dumplings.

986
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
Look at our work sheds.

987
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,680
Which family has white flour?

988
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,120
Here! Here!

989
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,280
I'm telling you,

990
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,880
the rich call it New Year

991
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,560
The poor call it another day to survive.

992
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,920
Actually, I think so too.

993
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,280
It's not impossible

994
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,000
for us workers to have a good life.

995
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
Mr. Dazhao, what do you mean?

996
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,440
Will we be able to eat

997
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,360
dumplings whenever we want?

998
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes!

999
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,680
Do you know there is a person called Marx?

1000
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,960
Don't know.

1001
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,480
Who?

1002
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,200
German. Big beard.

1003
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,320
Ever heard of him?

1004
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,440
Don't you have a beard?

1005
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,440
His beard is a lot bigger than mine!

1006
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,560
Let me tell you something.

1007
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,480
Marx has a view

1008
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,400
that the working class

1009
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
is the leader of human society.

1010
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,960
Only the society led by our working class

1011
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,920
is the most advanced society in the world.

1012
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,360
Is it?

1013
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,120
The most advanced society.

1014
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,120
This Marx said that the workers are leaders.

1015
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,080
Impossible.

1016
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,840
How can we workers be leaders?

1017
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,960
What impossible?

1018
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,640
In Russia, there is a man called Lenin

1019
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,880
who based himself on this viewpoint and theory.

1020
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,600
The people overthrew the bourgeois government.

1021
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,360
I know Russia is just north of us.

1022
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
The emperor of Russia is called the Tsar

1023
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,800
and not Emperor.

1024
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,480
It's Tsar, without the "di".

1025
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,840
It sounds like "bean paste stuffing".

1026
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,880
Tsar!

1027
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,560
After the fall of the Tsar,

1028
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,080
Lenin led the people

1029
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
through armed uprising

1030
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
and overthrew the bourgeois provisional government,

1031
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,920
and then set up the first country

1032
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,640
led by the working class in human history,

1033
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,560
which is called a socialist country

1034
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,480
and also called the Soviet Union.

1035
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
A Soviet is a representative council.

1036
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,400
A Soviet authority

1037
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
is an assembly of representatives of workers, peasants and soldiers.

1038
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,520
Right, what Shiyan said is correct.

1039
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,440
After the establishment of this government,

1040
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,360
the people did two things,

1041
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,880
two decrees were issued.

1042
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,480
The first

1043
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,160
-- I'll take this --

1044
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
is to announce that they will not participate in the World War.

1045
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,560
They don't play with them anymore!

1046
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,920
How did you know that?

1047
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
Just don't play with them!

1048
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
Don't play with these imperialists.

1049
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,120
The second

1050
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,720
-- everyone will be interested in hearing this --

1051
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,160
Say it!

1052
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,960
Say it!

1053
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,920
Sir, don't just talk!

1054
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,800
Drink a bowl of water.

1055
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,640
I'll drink some water.

1056
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,680
Don't leave us in suspense.

1057
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,400
Right!

1058
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,640
This second thing is

1059
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
the land is yours.

1060
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,400
The land is yours.

1061
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,440
The land is yours!

1062
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,440
It's all ours!

1063
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
Think about it. The land belongs to us.

1064
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,920
Is it still difficult for us to have a good life?

1065
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,280
We can be masters of our homes!

1066
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah!

1067
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,680
We can be masters of our own lives in the future.

1068
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,720
Mr. Dazhao,

1069
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,680
in this socialist country you just mentioned,

1070
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,027
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

1071
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
does it mean that people no longer exploit people

1072
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,720
and no one bully us poor people?

1073
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
Exactly, that's what it means.

1074
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,840
Then do you have the bearded man you mentioned

1075
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
and people like Lenin

1076
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,640
in China?

1077
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,080
Yes, let's find him.

1078
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,440
Don't worry, everyone.

1079
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,880
Now a group of people are looking for him.

1080
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,480
You are the bearded man!

1081
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,960
You are the bearded one!
