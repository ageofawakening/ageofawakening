[Episode Fourteen]

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,640
My apologies, everybody,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,840
I have a guest from my hometown here.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,120
How about we continue next time?

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,240
We haven't fully enjoyed our discussion yet, how come it's over now?

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,120
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]
I'm terribly sorry!

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,160
Prof. Hu, 

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
can we say goodbye to you in the Western manner?

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,680
Of course!

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,440
See you next time, Dr. Hu.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,160
Thanks for coming here.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,240
Come on.

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,480
[Wang Mengzou, Manager of Yadong Library]
Thanks.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,760
Goodbye, Dr. Hu.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,600
Thank you.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,560
See you, Dr. Hu.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,920
Come here.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,920
See you next time.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,360
Goodbye, Dr. Hu.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,520
Brother Mengzou,

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,560
Dr. Hu.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,920
Don't forget to eat more apples!

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,120
For the vitamin.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,400
Sure, thank you!

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,880
See you, Dr. Hu.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,000
See you.

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,240
Take care.

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,320
Brother Mengzou, it's been a while.

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,240
Good to see you!

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,960
Come over here to sit.

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,000
Here...

33
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,720
I'll take it.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,720
Brother Mengzou,

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,600
You must be just arriving.

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,920
So here is the thing,

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,520
now that "New Youth" had 

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
adopted collective editorship,  

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm here to establish the distribution station.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,920
I wasn't able to find Zhongfu, so I decided to come to you.

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Brother Zhongfu went to the Shaoxing Guildhall today.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
I thought there aren't any female 

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,160
faculties or students at Peking University.

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,120
That's true.

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,840
But, 

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,400
just now...

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
You're talking about the ladies in my office earlier?

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,360
They're members of my poetry club in Beijing.

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
And they're here to discuss vernacular poetry with me. 

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,600
No wonder your mother was so worried about you.

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Excuse me?

52
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,960
Your mother had a letter sent to me

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,120
saying that back in your hometown,

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440
there were loads of gossips,

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,880
and rumors about you.

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,680
Dongxiu was rather anxious at home.

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,600
So was your mother.

58
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,600
Therefore, they asked me to persuade you

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
to go back home and marry Dongxiu as soon as possible.

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,640
You see,

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,280
here's the letter.

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
You should think it over.

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
What you said got me really confused here.

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,440
You see?

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,960
What the heck are these?

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
Sheer nonsense! Brother Mengzou.

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
I too thought they were completely unfounded, before I arrived here.

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,120
Right!

69
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
But then, you guys are even talking about "vitamins",

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,440
So it's not all rumor after all.

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,000
Brother Mengzou, please don't get it wrong.

72
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,080
They're indeed the members of my poetry club in Beijing.

73
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,920
How can I put it, you're just...

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,320
But you, you guys were...

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
That's just common etiquette.

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,160
I...

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,360
This lad Ren Guangming is still quite the drinker!

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
[Zhou Shuren, pen name Lu Xun, styled Yucai, Officer at Ministry of Education]
Such a rare opportunity,

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
[Zhou Shuren, pen name Lu Xun, styled Yucai, Officer at Ministry of Education]
for us alumni to gather up in Beijing.

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
[Zhou Shuren, pen name Lu Xun, styled Yucai, Officer at Ministry of Education]
Such a rare gathering.

81
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,640
I forgot to ask Guangming just now

82
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
what's Yang Kaiming up to recently.

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
How come we haven't heard from him in a long time?

84
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,120
[Zhou Zuoren, styled Xingshao, Professor at Peking University]
Ren Guangming said, after Yang Kaiming graduated from the Normal University， 

85
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,800
[Zhou Zuoren, styled Xingshao, Professor at Peking University]
he went back home to teach.

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
He's a kindhearted fellow.

87
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,240
He often gives financial support to a widow,

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
which reproached by her clansmen.

89
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
There was one day,

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,960
Yang Kaiming got drunk,

91
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
and fell asleep next to the table at the widow's.

92
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
The next dawn, somehow her clansmen got informed,

93
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
and then

94
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
they detained her for denouncement.

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,560
The head of the clan held a meeting.

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
According to the rules of their clan,

97
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,760
they decided to drown the widow to punish her.

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
Yang Kaiming was so traumatized hearing what happened that he lost his mind.

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,040
Nowadays,

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
he begs and gibbers on the street all day long.

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
He won't recognize anybody anymore.

102
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
Madness!

103
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,240
People became mad.

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,880
So did the world.

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,280
Don't!

106
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,560
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,680
I don't wanna die!

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,960
I'm begging you!

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm begging you! Please, please don't kill me!

110
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,680
I don't wanna die!

111
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:52,960
I really don't!

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,360
Hey, Jiusun, what on earth...

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,840
What do you want?!

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Cou..cousin...

115
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
Cousin, you got to save me!

116
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,480
Somebody is going to kill me!

117
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:00,800
What?

118
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,160
They're chasing after me to kill me!

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,560
Don't!!

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,920
No, no, no!!! Don't open the door!

121
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,200
Don't! Don't open the door!!

122
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,240
Don't open the door!! Don't!!!

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,120
But, Jiusun, what's...

124
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,240
They...Listen...

125
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,360
Their footsteps!

126
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,640
Listen you two!

127
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,520
Can't you hear them coming close?

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
They're holding a 10-inch knife,

129
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
very sharp - it's bloody!

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,080
It's all bloody outside!!

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
They're going to kill me with that knife!

132
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,360
I...I don't want to die!

133
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
I have to hide.

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,920
I have to hide somewhere!

135
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,800
No, hide somewhere...

136
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,680
Jiusun, come over here, come on.

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,880
Wait a bit...

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,920
No...

139
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,880
I don't wanna die...

140
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't wanna die at all!!

141
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,560
You're just a secretary from Taiyuan

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
coming to visit in Beijing -- nobody knows you here!

143
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,280
Who would kill you?

144
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,800
How come someone wants to kill you?

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,760
Come on,

146
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,880
Get out of that first.

147
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Cousin, if I die,

148
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,720
can you bring this letter to my mum and sister?

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,600
He looks deranged, must have lost his mind.

150
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,080
Jiusun, you just come out first.

151
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,600
We'll talk it over, is that okay?

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,640
I won't go out!

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
I won't!

154
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,040
Please be good and get out first.

155
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
I won't go! Don't drag me!

156
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,440
Just come out please.

157
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Get out!

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,640
Hurry up, be good, get out now!

159
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,840
No, I won't, I won't go!

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,720
Just come here, will you?

161
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,360
I won't!!

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
Come over, be good, come on...

163
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,240
They're here!

164
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,080
Just get out first!

165
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,880
They're here!

166
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,480
I won't go!!!

167
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,440
Jiusun, it's me, Jiusun!

168
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,960
You guys are here.

169
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
What on earth happened to him?

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,920
On our way to Beijing, Jiusun had

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,280
seen many people who were starved to death.

172
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,160
He had a breakdown.

173
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
In these few days when we're staying at the inn,

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
he kept moving into new rooms.

175
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
But still he can't sleep at all,

176
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,800
as he was horrified that somebody would kill him.

177
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,320
This morning,

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,600
he insisted on coming to you

179
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
and that those people are after him again.

180
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
It seems that he's having a psychosis.

181
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
Let's take him to a hospital first.

182
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,840
Jiusun, Jiusun, let's get out of here!

183
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
Come on, Jiusun.

184
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,320
No! Don't touch me!

185
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,360
What are you doing? I won't leave!

186
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,800
Jiusun, it's me!

187
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,600
What are you people doing?

188
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,240
It's me, Jiusun!

189
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,800
What are you doing?

190
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
You tell me now, why do you want me dead?

191
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,440
Why are you trying to kill me?

192
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Why kill me?!

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,760
Why?!

194
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,600
Tell me why!

195
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,720
Why kill me?!

196
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,680
Tell me!

197
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:03,840
"Diary of a Madman”

198
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,240
"Diary of a Madman”

199
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,520
One pair of silver cups,

200
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,760
two pairs of silver chopsticks,

201
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,120
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]
one felt table cloth,

202
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]
one felt table cloth,

203
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,040
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

204
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,080
four handkerchiefs,

205
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,280
Slow down, slow down.

206
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,280
Four handkerchiefs

207
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,480
Four handkerchiefs

208
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,200
to express our best wishes for Mr. Shizhi's wedding.

209
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,000
Shen Yimo,

210
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,080
Liu Wendian, 
[Gao Yihan, Professor at Peking University]

211
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Chen Daqi,
[Gao Yihan, Professor at Peking University]

212
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
Ma Xulun,

213
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,240
Cai Yuanpei,

214
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,960
Slow down.

215
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,080
Cai Yuanpei,

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,600
Zhang Shizhao,

217
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,280
Gao Yihan,

218
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,400
Liu Bannong,

219
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,280
Li Dazhao,

220
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
and you, Chen Duxiu.

221
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,040
Great! Now Shizhi is back to his hometown for his wedding.

222
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,480
As for this list of wedding gifts,

223
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
you guys should make several copies of it 

224
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,680
and post them in our offices, 
[Liu Bannong, Professor at Peking University]

225
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,880
and by the university entrance.

226
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
It's essentially a notice of appeasement.

227
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,400
On one hand, it's a notice to the slanderers

228
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,080
asking them to cut the gossips.

229
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,000
On the other hand,

230
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
it's for the female poetry club members who are hankering after him,

231
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,280
so that they stop fantasizing.

232
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,960
Very well done, Zhongfu!

233
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
I can finally have a moment of peace!

234
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,520
No need to post the notice outside the dormitory of Shizhi and Yihan.

235
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,320
How so?

236
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,960
Why though?

237
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
We should save some opportunities for the female poetry club members.

238
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,560
Even though Shizhi is now married,

239
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,240
Yihan can take over and receive their visits.

240
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
I have nothing like Shizhi's charisma. 

241
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,480
No can do!
