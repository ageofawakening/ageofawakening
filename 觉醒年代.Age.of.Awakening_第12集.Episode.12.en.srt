00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:19,920
Great.

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,400
Here.

188
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,920
Bottoms up.

189
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,960
I wonder if there would be people in the future

190
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
who will remember today's date.

191
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,920
There will be.

192
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
By virtue of our effort.

193
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,920
Have a seat.

194
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,800
Here.

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Having adopted collective editorialship,

196
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,640
"New Youth" from volume four issue one

197
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
will officially rescind its submission policy.

198
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,200
All submitted manuscripts including articles and translations

199
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
will follow the editorial department's

200
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,600
collective decision-making system.

201
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
With every new issue will be an editorial meeting

202
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,920
to discuss manuscripts for the next issue.

203
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
An editorial collective still needs one thing.

204
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,240
And I think the candidate must be none other than brother Zhongfu.

205
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,280
Do we all agree?

206
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,160
I agree.

207
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
Thank you.

208
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm grateful for everyone's trust.

209
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,760
Dear colleagues,

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Our magazine "New Youth" will use Peking University as its base,

211
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,800
have science and democracy for its ensign,

212
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,400
while advocacy of the New Culture movement,

213
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
dissemination of new ideas,

214
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,000
and the nurturing of young people will be its chief objectives.

215
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
The hope is to set off an upsurge that is

216
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
an extensive profound ideological awakening campaign across China

217
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
to seek a scientific path towards national salvation.

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,880
I hope as colleagues we will work together as one

219
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,600
to collectively shoulder the burden of this sacred mission.

220
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,320
Your words have warmed my heart.

221
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:46,117
[Liu Bannong, Professor at Peking University]

222
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
I want to cry.

223
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,800
It's true, brother Zhongfu.

224
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
For more than four months

225
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040
I travelled in the south.

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
Lobbying everywhere, and everywhere a dead end.

227
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,920
All of China is in a state of paralysis.

228
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
So I think

229
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
enlightening the people

230
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
is "New Youth's" most important task.

231
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,320
Enlightment needs focus and direction.

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Advocating for New Culture means criticizing old ways of thinking.

233
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,720
"New Culture"

234
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,600
must target regressive thinking that wants to restore the past.

235
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Unleash an onslaught.

236
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
Deqian, we can't be too aggressive.

237
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
We will only hurt ourselves.

238
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
No construction without destruction.

239
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,920
If these regressive forces

240
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
are not destroyed

241
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
how can there be New Culture?

242
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
The influence and attraction

243
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
of "New Youth" for young people

244
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
is mainly on the basis of its commentary on current events.

245
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,800
I believe manuscripts of this nature need to be enhanced.

246
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
The October Revolution has recently erupted in Russia.

247
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
I feel this is an important event.

248
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,480
The affairs of Russia are still so far away from us.

249
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,760
We should put our focus

250
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,760
on promoting New Culture.

251
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
I feel we still need to persevere with

252
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,520
the objective brother Zhongfu had

253
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
when he started "New Youth."

254
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
No discussion of politics for twenty years.

255
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
The situation of China currently is

256
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
divided along two governments and two armies.

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,920
In these circumstances,

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
the political waters are too murky.

259
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
It would be best not to wade into it rashly.

260
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
It is possible to not discuss politics for twenty years?

261
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Gentlemen,

262
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
from the first time you met

263
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,680
you've been arguing over this question.

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
To date, there has still been no victor.

265
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
This issue can be considered at length.

266
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,680
Take your time discussing it.

267
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
The issue at hand right now

268
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
centres on the New Culture Movement.

269
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
Put out some drafts that carry weight.

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Zuoren,

271
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
what have you been working on recently?

272
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
I'm a newcomer here,

273
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
and still need some time to adjust.

274
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
How has Zhou Shuren been doing recently?

275
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
The students are Peking University

276
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
are wearing the school insignia that he designed.

277
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
He can't drift forever

278
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
outside of the New Culture movement.

279
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:35,920
Exactly.

280
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,040
He is a major asset.

281
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
Deqian, invite him again.

282
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
The only way to get him to

283
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,520
come out from the mountains is if you were to personally

284
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
set out yourself, I'm afraid.

285
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
Alright, I will call on him some time.

286
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
I will learn from Master Cai and Liu Xuande

287
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
and beg three times for him to leave his hermitage.

288
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,360
Alright.

289
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Let's keep our meeting short and effective,

290
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
and stop here.

291
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,120
Shizhi and Shouchang, please stay.

292
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,200
Everyone else is free to leave.

293
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,280
You're really not inviting us over for a meal?

294
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
Did I say earlier? Meals not included.

295
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,280
If you have any complaints, talk to Shizhi.

296
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
Shizhi, you must host next time.

297
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Don't bad-mouth me. It'll definitely be my treat.

298
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,680
Try this.

299
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
This isn't filling.

300
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm off, everyone.

301
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Alright.

302
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Take care.

303
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,640
Thank you.

304
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,120
Shouchang,

305
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,160
sit here.

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,640
Alright.

307
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
Shizhi, sit here.

308
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,360
I asked the two of you to stay

309
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
because I noticed just now

310
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,560
the two of you have very different thoughts

311
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,760
about managing the publication.

312
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I didn't let you continue earlier

313
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
for fear of disrupting everyone else's ideas.

314
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,760
Now you can discuss it separately.

315
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,080
My reasoning is very simple.

316
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,840
The objective of publishing "New Youth"

317
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
is intellectual enlightenment fundamentally as a way

318
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
as a way to transform the nature of our citizenry for national salvation.

319
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
To use cultural ideas to construct

320
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,960
an innovative base for politics in China,

321
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,520
rather than directly solving political problems.

322
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,960
That is wishful thinking, Shizhi.

323
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
We are living in such a

324
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
magnificient sweeping era.

325
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
How can intellectual enlightenment be discussed

326
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,640
while evading

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
the political questions of the country that are a matter of life or death.

328
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,800
Political questions...

329
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Politics are a matter of Machiavellian craft, of transactions.

330
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
It's a dirty kind of game.

331
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,200
It has nothing to do with scholarship.

332
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
That is an intellectual sleight of hand.

333
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,400
Politics is politics. Politicking is politicking.

334
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,120
Two different things.

335
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
If we are interested in intellectual enlightenment

336
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,840
segregated from commentary on current events,

337
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,480
what can it be

338
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,360
besides idle chit-chat?

339
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,160
And what about idle chit-chat?

340
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,000
Idle chit-chat hinders the nation. It has always been so.

341
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
So what is the current situation?

342
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,280
The Beiyang government opposes the government in the south.

343
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,640
Is this not current events?

344
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,160
According to what you're saying

345
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,960
our "New Youth"

346
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,000
ought to pass judgement

347
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,000
on whether the two governments should unite or fight.

348
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,360
If getting mixed with all that

349
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
what you call scholarship?

350
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Big political questions. I'm talking about big political questions.

351
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
The direction of the country, the path to follow.

352
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
Which direction to go.

353
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
This at least must be discussed, no?

354
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Then which direction do you think China ought to follow?

355
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
Recently I've read Chinese and Japanese reports

356
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
about the October Revolution in Russia.

357
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,560
I am deeply inspired.

358
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,840
The Bolshevik Party

359
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,760
seized political power through violent revolution.

360
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
And set off a new revolution in Russia.

361
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
What new revolution?

362
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,120
You just said yourself

363
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
they seized political power through violent revolution.

364
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
It is merely a change in name.

365
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,280
You are too dogmatic, Shizhi.

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Have you read their programme?

367
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,320
I've read it.

368
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,040
I think

369
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
it's very helpful for solving China's actual problems.

370
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,240
I've wanted to look into it in recent days.

371
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,000
I am also very interested in Russia's October Revolution.

372
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,480
Let's look into it together.

373
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,920
In terms of development models,

374
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,720
I still propose

375
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,480
that we should fully follow the lead of the United States.

376
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,520
You see,

377
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,040
we talk and talk and always return to the same topic.

378
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,800
In the past, when I said no political dicussions for twenty years,

379
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,640
it was because I didn't want it to be like before again.

380
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
To engage in these political fights.

381
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,320
I want to put all my effort into intellectual enlightenment.

382
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
But intellectual enlightenment is also within the context of politics.

383
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,680
Right now, the theme of "New Youth"

384
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,880
is New Culture.

385
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,320
To liberate the citizenry

386
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,240
from old regressive ideas of restoring the previous regime.

387
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,840
Alright, daring vanguards. If I put it that way, do you agree?

388
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,400
I agree.

389
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,340
Do you agree?

390
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,280
I agree.

391
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,720
Old Mr. Lin Shu

392
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
sent word to me

393
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
that he wants to do a lecture

394
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:46,885
[Red Building Humanities Teaching and Research Section]

395
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,240
at Peking University.

396
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
He wants to discuss the Tongcheng prose school.

397
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,600
Lin Shu?

398
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,000
He should lecture on the great Western canon.

399
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Why is he talking about the Tongchen school?

400
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
This is a clear challenge.

401
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
This Gu Tangsheng got something started.

402
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
All at once,

403
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,200
he got the students and teachers

404
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
interested in academic scholarship.

405
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm thinking

406
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,480
you gentlemen had better pull yourselves together.

407
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
Otherwise, you'll cede the field.

408
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,840
How could we cede the field?

409
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
We are all soldiers here.

410
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,880
Shizhi,

411
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
why don't you tell the gentleman

412
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
about your thoughts.

413
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm still working on it.

414
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Don't be modest. Go ahead.

415
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
The point of holding lecture

416
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,640
is to disseminate new ideas.

417
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
But where to start?

418
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
It's truly a puzzle.

419
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
The current political situation is very chaotic.

420
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,840
There are many social issues.

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
The focal point of young students' concerns

422
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,720
is the direction of China.

423
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
Therefore, I'm also very conflicted

424
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,600
about the lecture series.

425
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,280
Should it discuss current events?

426
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
Or academic scholarship?

427
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,640
Shizhi, I really would like to

428
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
debate you on this topic.

429
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,520
In my view, current events and academic scholarship -

430
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:49,920
Shouchang.

431
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,240
You -

432
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,800
Now is not the time for debate.

433
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
This thing about "No discussion of politics for twenty years" -

434
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,720
when I first started

435
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,280
"New Youth,"

436
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
it was a tenet of the publication.

437
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
However, what is politics?

438
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320


439
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,680


440
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,200


441
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,040


442
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,880


443
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800


444
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,560


445
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,920


446
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320


447
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,920


448
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080


449
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,520


450
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040


451
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560


452
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,560


453
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040


454
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,280


455
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,320


456
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,520


457
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,600


458
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960


459
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,720


460
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480


461
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,120


462
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,600


463
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,040


464
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,360


465
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360


466
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960


467
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040


468
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,640


469
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240


470
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320


471
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,080


472
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,080


473
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840


474
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,800


475
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,880


476
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,600
