[The Age of Awakening]

00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:06,135
[Episode Twelve]

3
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320
It's hard to define.

4
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,680
In retrospect,

5
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,200
 a lot of what "New Youth" discussed

6
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,040
turned out to be current affairs.

7
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,880
What most of the readers are interested in turned out to be current affairs as well.

8
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
So as far as I can see,

9
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,560
since we are trying to gain more positions,

10
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,920
we've got to have an objective,

11
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
something that the younger generation cares about the most at the moment.

12
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,920
I agree.

13
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080
There's no need to confine ourselves.

14
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,520
We should simply discuss 

15
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040
whatever people are most interested in.

16
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560
Don't be hedged in rules and regulations.

17
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,560
Please come in.

18
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040
Sir,

19
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,280
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for you with urgent matters. 

20
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,320
Shall we...

21
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,520
Just say it here.

22
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,600
There is no need to keep it away from the others.

23
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
Minister Wang said on the phone

24
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,720
the British professor Cartwright, who was dismissed by out university,

25
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
wrote to the British Prime Minister 

26
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,120
and complained about Peking University.

27
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,600
The British embassy presented a note to the Republic government.

28
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,040
It startled Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui.

29
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,360
Minister Wang said that you have caused big trouble this time.

30
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
That's why he wanted to see you immediately.

31
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
Okay, I'm aware of that now.

32
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040
But the matter of dismissing Cartwright 

33
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,640
is supposed to be relevant to the Ministry of Education. 

34
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
Why is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs getting involved now?

35
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
Anyway, go prepare the sedan for me please.

36
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,080
Brother Zhongfu, sit down first.

37
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm leaving for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now.

38
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
As for the lecture series,

39
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,800
I think it's better to call them academic lectures.

40
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,880
Let's try to limit the theme to New Culture.

41
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,600
Specifically, we can focus on topics like writing characters reform,

42
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,440
vernacular essays, vernacular poems,

43
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,000
even funeral affairs or folk customs. 

44
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,840
But for politics,

45
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,920
let's try to avoid that,

46
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
in case the government intervenes.

47
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,120
This include 

48
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
Sun Zhongshan's military government,

49
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
the melee of war lords, and such.

50
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,960
We should refrain from talking about all of these.

51
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
In such an eventful and precarious time,

52
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,640
we can easily get in troubles.

53
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,760
Let's not discuss politics.

54
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,200
Zhongfu,

55
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,520
you're still in charge of the discussions.

56
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,200
Everyone here can participate,

57
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,880
and feel free to pick your own topics,

58
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,520
as long as we form a New Culture-themes lecture series.

59
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,360
I'll also join you.

60
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,160
Sir,

61
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,520
we don't wish to continue the discussion anymore.

62
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,880
I just want to ask

63
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,720
how can the British Government interfere

64
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
with our dismissal of Cartwright?

65
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,320
And how can we simply allow such interference to happen?

66
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm not aware of the details myself.

67
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
This is why I need to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now.

68
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,320
Alright.

69
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,200
Department of Liberal Arts has to be mentally prepared anyway.

70
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,160
I think there's going to be a lawsuit.

71
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,440
I'm leaving.

72
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,200
Shizhi, with regard to the discussion of academics and current affairs 

73
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
this is what I think...

74
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,120
Hang on a moment,

75
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,560
let's not talk about 

76
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,920
that for now.

77
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's talk about Cartwright instead.

78
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,480
Good point.

79
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,720
This is the actual position gaining.

80
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,400
Sit down please.

81
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,760
Preposterous!

82
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,800
It doesn't make any sense.

83
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
How come they're poking their nose

84
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,320
into our internal affairs?

85
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,080
The most ridiculous part is that

86
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,920
we dismissed him for fair reasons.

87
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,520
How can he complain about us?

88
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Brother Jiemin, you're finally here!

89
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
It seems that the chancellor of Peking University 

90
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
is much busier than me!

91
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
How can I compare to you?

92
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,000
Whenever master Wang speaks

93
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
the humble me, Cai Yuanpei, will have to rush down here in a split second.

94
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,400
Alright then,

95
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
please state your instructions.

96
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,720
If it's not for something extremely urgent,

97
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,720
I wouldn't have disturbed Chancellor Cai.

98
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
The dismissal of the foreign professor at Peking University

99
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,240
caused big trouble.

100
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,440
Cartwright turned out to be a descendant of British aristocracy. 

101
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
He wrote to their Prime Minister Lloyd-George

102
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,800
complaining about you Cai Yuanpei overstepping your authority, your breaching of contract

103
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
and discrimination against British citizens.

104
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,040
He's demanding apologies, compensation and resumption of their posts

105
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,360
for both himself and other discharged British personnel 

106
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
from Peking University.

107
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,000
Lloyd-George 

108
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,840
assigned the British Envoy 

109
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,000
John Newell Jordan to handle this complaint.

110
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,600
The British Embassy 

111
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,600
had already presented a note to our government.

112
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,040
Both Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui 

113
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,920
had ordered me to take care of this matter immediately.

114
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,080
Brother Botang, this sounds really interesting to me.

115
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,800
Peking University is a Chinese national university.

116
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,240
The hiring and discharging of teaching personnel 

117
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
are the rights and responsibilities entrusted by the state.

118
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,080
How are these relevant to 

119
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
British Prime Minister and British embassy?

120
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
Furthermore, there were prior cases of

121
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,200
discharging foreign personnel 

122
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beiyang University and other schools.

123
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,200
There has never been any issues before.

124
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
Why is it all of a sudden a big trouble

125
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
when I'm involved? 

126
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,600
Cartwright complaint about you based on two grounds:

127
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,760
one is that his contract at Peking university

128
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
was signed by Ministry of Education.

129
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
Peking University has no authority to terminate his contract.

130
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
The other is that the term of his contract is 4 years.

131
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
What Peking University is doing now is breaching of contract,

132
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,120
which is illegal.

133
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,560
This is simple.

134
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
We can terminate his contract through Ministry of Education.

135
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
As for breach of contract, that is sheer nonsense.

136
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,680
The contract has it written in black and white:

137
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
those who are incompetent at their jobs,

138
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,360
and those who violated the school's regulations

139
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
can be discharged.

140
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
Strictly speaking,

141
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,360
his incompetency at teaching duties 

142
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,880
caused losses to our university.

143
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,320
It was HIM who breached the contract.

144
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
We're supposed to hold HIM accountable.

145
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,800
Brother Jiemin,

146
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
the situation is for more complicated than what you imagined.

147
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,800
The British Embassy presented a note of protest,

148
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,160
and turned the case into a diplomatic event.

149
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
There's no small matter in diplomacy,

150
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,440
not to mention during times of war.

151
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,680
Duan Qirui asked me to tell you

152
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,760
our government had already declared to join the world war.

153
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,400
Both China and Britain are Allies.

154
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,560
We're are on the same boat.

155
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,360
He hopes Peking University would focus on the big picture 

156
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
and wouldn't harm the relationship 

157
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,040
between China and Britain because of this matter.

158
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,960
It seems like this actually caused some troubles.

159
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
Some big troubles.

160
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,120
Otherwise I wouldn't have anxiously urged you to come here.

161
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,920
If you didn't show up,

162
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,520
I would have visited you anyway.

163
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,080
Okay then.

164
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,640
You're the mastermind, you tell me what to do.

165
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,520
The first big step towards Peking University's reform got tripped.

166
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
Can you tell me how can I continue my jobs as the chancellor?

167
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,120
Not to mention 

168
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,160
it concerns the our national dignity and general fairness, 

169
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,760
how am I supposed to explain this to the students and faculties of our university?

170
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,040
Brother Jiemin, I understand your difficulties.

171
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,560
But this is 

172
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,120
indeed a thorny issue

173
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,840
that is not likely to be resolved all by your sole will.

174
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,720
I think it's better not to act on impulse.

175
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
Why don't you go back and discuss the issue with your faculties?

176
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
Once you guys reached a consensus, 

177
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
we can discuss the plans for the next steps.

178
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Brother Botang,

179
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,160
Discharging unqualified foreign personnel 

180
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
like Cartwright 

181
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,360
was a decision collectively made by the appraisal committee of Peking University!

182
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,800
To overthrow this decision,

183
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,360
it has to go through the school appraisal committee,

184
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,640
As far as I can tell,

185
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,680
it is almost impossible to revoked.

186
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
Brother Jieming,

187
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,160
I invited you here

188
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,400
to follow the orders and carry out my duties.

189
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,080
Likewise, your conveying the message to your employees

190
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
can be considered as fulfilling your duties.

191
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,400
Exactly how you're going to do it

192
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,200
is Peking University's liberty.

193
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
We'll talk further after you guys make up your mind.

194
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,960
Is that alright?

195
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
Jiang, we're not going back to Peking University.

196
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,480
Let's go directly to Ministry of Education.

197
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,920
Ya!

198
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,960
Zhongfu, you guys are both here.

199
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,680
Mr. Cai.

200
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,320
It's good that you're both here.

201
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,280
I'm glad you happen to arrive.

202
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,160
We created a program

203
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,840
for the New Culture lecture series.

204
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
All of the topics are substantial. 

205
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,920
Mr. Cai.

206
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
Brother Zhongfu, can I have some water?

207
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,600
Mr. Cai.

208
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
What happened.

209
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,840
Shouchang, 

210
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
please use a large bowl.

211
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
You two can take a look.

212
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,280
Zhongfu, Zhongfu, Brother Zhongfu.

213
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
Gangster logic!

214
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,440
Zhongfu, you cannot do this!

215
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,640
Pushing us too hard!

216
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,080
We can't do this!

217
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,840
This is the copy of démarche.  

218
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,280
We only have this one copy.

219
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
We cannot destroy it!

220
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,400
Let's hurry up and discuss 

221
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,920
how to cope with this.

222
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
Pay no attention to it! Do things in our own ways!

223
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
I knew you'd have this kind of response.

224
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,160
Isn't that your response as well?

225
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
This matter is rather complicated.

226
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
This fellow Cartwright had written a complaint

227
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,560
to his Prime Minister Lloyd-George. 

228
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,680
Lloyd-George gave his orders 

229
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,880
to the British Envoy Jordan. 

230
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,280
And the Envoy Jordan presented a note 

231
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
to our government.

232
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
This whole thing turned into a diplomatic event.

233
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,680
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui of our government 

234
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,680
both gave specific orders.

235
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,240
So did Ministry of Education.

236
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
What about the position Peking University should take?

237
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,160
They only gave us 7 words:

238
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,280
consider the big picture, minimize the problems.

239
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,480
How can we minimize it?

240
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,840
We've already put up the public notice!

241
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,240
The die is cast. Can we simply eat our own words?

242
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,160
This is why I said it's a thorny issue.

243
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,600
I have already inform the school

244
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,360
to have a appraisal committee meeting tomorrow morning,

245
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,240
to discuss this matter.

246
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,360
What is there to be discussed?

247
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
Are we supposed to surrender out sovereignty rights under humiliating terms?

248
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,120
Are we supposed to surrender to the foreigners?

249
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,280
Mr. Cai, we have to take this matter seriously!

250
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
Du Qirui exhorted again and again, saying that 

251
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,040
during this time of war, Britain is our ally.

252
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,280
We save their face, instead of saving a little only to lose a lot

253
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
and harm the interest of the nation.

254
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,640
It is sovereignty that is the biggest interest of a nation.

255
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
Who is right, who is wrong? There's no need to debate.

256
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,720
You're right.

257
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Okay then, now that it is a diplomatic event,

258
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,840
our Peking University and Cartwright 

259
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,440
can be seen as the representatives of the interests of our nations.

260
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Our Peking University holds in her one hand the national honor 

261
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,600
the other had general fairness.

262
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
Losing either one of these

263
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,360
would be a crime to our nation.

264
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
Well-said Zhongfu!

265
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
Let's talk about it right now

266
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
how are we going to hold 

267
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,680
the school appraisal committee meeting tomorrow.

268
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,560
Alright?

269
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,480
Sure!

270
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,880
Everybody, the current situation is not optimistic.

271
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,360
Cartwright had already demanded that

272
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,600
Peking University apologize to him, offer him compensation

273
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,400
and revoke our decision to dismiss him.

274
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,240
At the same time, the British Embassy presented a note to our government.

275
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,640
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui here

276
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,240
gave us direct orders.

277
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,920
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education both

278
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,160
asked us to resolve the issue in a short period of time.

279
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,560
Just now the Minister of Education Fu Zengxiang called

280
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,160
and said the British Embassy

281
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,320
is waiting for our response.

282
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,080
What should Peking University do?

283
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,480
To surrender or to fight?

284
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
Please state your opinions.

285
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,840
Let's start from Zhongfu.

286
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,360
After I learned what happened from Mr. Cai,

287
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,400
I was furious. 

288
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
This suddenly brought my mind 

289
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,680
back to the Opium War happened more than 70 years ago.

290
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,280
How did the Western invaders bully our China?

291
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,680
How did they plunder our nation?

292
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Even back then, 

293
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,440
the British government 

294
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
used the excuse of protecting British citizens in China

295
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
to open the gate of our country 

296
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
with their powerful navy and advanced weaponry.

297
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,840
Our Chinese nation thus started to decline.

298
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Today, they are playing their same old tricks.

299
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,280
Again, using protecting their citizen in China as an excuse, 

300
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,560
they are even trying to interfere with

301
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,480
the internal affairs of our university!

302
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,920
What is this?

303
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,000
Plain robbery!

304
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,160
If this can be tolerated, what cannot?

305
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,160
My view is pretty clear,

306
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Peking University cannot surrender!

307
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,600
If we do, we'll become sinners to our own history.

308
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,680
Dear colleagues,

309
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,560
I came back to my motherland all the way from the United States.

310
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,400
All I wanted is to be

311
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,080
an upright and dignified Chinese. 

312
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,080
What the British is doing is too absurd.

313
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,800
If we have to surrender to 

314
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,240
this type of shameful request,

315
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,560
how can we still talk about sovereignty and national dignity?

316
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
That way we won't even have the most basic human dignity!

317
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,560
Indeed!

318
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,840
This is absurd!

319
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,600
We'll never surrender!

320
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
Everybody, listen to me.

321
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,320
To shoulder our responsibilities to Peking University,

322
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,960
can we come up with a sure card

323
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,160
just in case.

324
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,040
Rest assured!

325
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,240
Last night, Shouchang read through 

326
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,000
all the references related to this case.

327
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,560
I suggest we listen to him.

328
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,920
Shouchang, please.

329
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,720
Alright.

330
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Dear committee members,

331
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,680
I traced back and referred to the Peking University Education Reform Proposal

332
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,440
Mr. Cai had submitted to Ministry of Education when he took office.

333
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,400
One of stipulations specified that

334
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Peking University has the right to independently decide upon

335
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,760
the employing and discharging of teaching personnel. 

336
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,720
This whole proposal was approved by

337
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,840
 the then President of the Republic Li Yuanhong,

338
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
which means it has legal effect.

339
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,440
Besides, I looked through the approval document 

340
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,080
from Ministry of Education with regard to

341
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,000
Peking University forming its appraisal committee.

342
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,360
One of the stipulations stated, 

343
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,440
Peking University Appraisal Committee 

344
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,960
may base on actual circumstances 

345
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,640
dismiss unqualified teaching personnel. 

346
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,480
These two should suffice to prove 

347
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,600
Cartwright's litigation is complete nonsense. 

348
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,800
Shouchang,

349
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,000
I can tell that

350
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
you must have stayed up all night yesterday.

351
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,600
But I can assure you that you won't have stayed up for nothing!
