[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:06,135
[Episode Twelve]

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,080
I don't think our New Culture Movement

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,760
should be limited to

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,160
ideological enlightenment among the elites.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,600
We also need to transform society.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,960
Brother Zhongfu, with all due respect,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,920
I found your earlier statement

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,200
"No mentioning of politics for 20 years"

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
to be too impractical.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
Shouchang, the gathering we have today

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,120
might turn into a debate!

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,720
What do you mean?

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,920
You've met your match.

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
Shizhi came all the way back from the United States

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,800
only because of that statement of mine.

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,880
It's true.
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Peking University Professor]

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,600
I would like to consult Mr. Shou Chang on this question.

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,160
Great. Today the three of us will stay up all night

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,200
and have a long talk.

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,720
Come in.

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,280
The welcome feast has been all laid out.
[Zhou Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Beijing Normal University Middle School student]

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,480
Welcome home.

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,520
"New Youth," I am back.

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,120
In 1918

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
Construction of the Red Building at Peking University was completed.

27
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,520
This red coloured structure

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,320
henceforth became the headquarters of the New Culture Movement,

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,320
the incubator of the May Fourth Movement,

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
as well as a base for spreading Marxism

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
and socialist ideas.
[Peking University Red Building]

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,400
My first task after taking office

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
is to pay you a formal visit at Peking University.

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,480
Fan Yuanlian has gone on a visit to the United States

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,160
so I can only fumble my way through as a stand-in.

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
So please, Master Cai, I must beg for your help.
[Fu Zengxiang, styled Yuanshu, Minister of Education]

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,240
Greetings Mr. Cai.

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,720
Hello.

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,720
Yuanshu, this is the result borne from the collaboration

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
of many colleagues at Peking University.

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,320
I believe

42
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,600
The construction of this new building
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Zhimin, Peking University Principal]

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,400
will make the most of the wind in the sails of the New Culture Movement

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
and education in China as well as at Peking University

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,880
will take a big step forward.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Well said, well said.

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
Please, come this way.

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,520
Alright.

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
Please take a look.

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Once you took office

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,280
the construction of this building at Peking University was completed.

52
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,200
The interiors are still being renovated.

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,200
The work has been pretty much completed.

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,080
We are planning to start using it this year.

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,600
Impressive!

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,320
Master Cai, with this new building

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
conditions at Peking University will be greatly improved!

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
There are a few reading rooms.

59
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,680
Mr. Shouchang. Mister Cai.

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,680
What are you doing?

61
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
Aren't we about to get down to the struggle here?

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
So I'm getting my hands dirty.

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,400
Let me introduce you.

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
This is the Minister of Education, Fu Zengxiang.

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,520
This is the director of the library, Mr. Li Dazhao.

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,880
Greetings Minister Fu.

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
The General of "The Tiger," Li Dazhao!

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
I've heard so much about you.

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
You're too kind.

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
I heard you traveled in the south for several months.

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
Did you find it productive?

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm sorry to say that

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
I set out to travel widely,

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
to investigate the difficulties of the people

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
and better explore how to save the nation.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Unfortunately, I've returned

77
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,280
empty-handed, having only met dead ends.

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,120
No matter what,

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
it was a hard journey you took,

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,080
civic minded and public-spirited.

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,680
And now you're finally back.

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,120
It's good to be back.

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,680
Brother Zhongfu's "New Youth" magazine

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,520
could now be officially inaugurated.

85
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,800
Mr. Cai,

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
it just so happens that we are holding an editorial meeting

87
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,400
at Brother Zhongfu's place for "New Youth."

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,680
Why don't you join us?

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
I won't be coming

90
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,160
as there are still much to do at the university.

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,960
With the your group's good planning

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
I believe that the banner of New Culture

93
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,280
will be held aloft to all this time.

94
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,400
this way, minister, please. 

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,200
Alright.

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,840
This way, this is...

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,480
This is the newspaper room.

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,880
The calligraphy research room.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Editorial office.

100
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
There are newspapers, documents.

101
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,120
Right, yes.

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,440
Books.

103
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,160
Documents.

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,800
You scholar types are most in need of nutrients.

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
Here, peanuts and melon seeds.

106
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,280
This is great.

107
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,400
That's mine. Here.

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Today you are all here.

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
I didn't prepare anything.

110
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
I'll quickly cook something for you.

111
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,040
Junman,

112
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,240
you don't need to make anything today.

113
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,440
The editorial committee is only having a meeting. No meals included.

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,120
Why?

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,320
If anyone is to host,

116
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
it ought to be Shizhi.

117
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Why?

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,480
He got a raise.

119
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
Two hundred and eight silver dollars a month.

120
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,600
First class professor salary.

121
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
His treat. No one better.

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,760
Then in my opinion, never mind a meal,

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
he ought to host a banquet.

124
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
Quickly send for his wife from back home.

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,160
Sis, not again.

126
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
To have the fortune of sharing a tiny compound of Shizhi

127
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,520
is has been wretched for me.
[Gao Yihan, Peking University Professor]

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,760
Every day there is a crowd of young women
[Gao Yihan, Peking University Professor]

129
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,120
lining up for an appointment.

130
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,160
Leaving me without

131
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,840
any peace of mind.

132
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,600
Shizhi, let me ask you,

133
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
is it true that every day at school

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,880
you receive five letters

135
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
and meet with three female visitors?

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
Why don't you also honestly answer a question of mine.

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
Is it true you won't feel at ease

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
unless you criticize me a few times a day?

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
I heard that Huang Kan told his students
[Shen Yinmo, Peking University Professor]

140
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,280
one time while teaching

141
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,200
that Chen Duxiu with his promotion of New Culture

142
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
has brought Peking University three Vs.

143
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,760
Vernacular prose.

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,640
Vernacular poetry.

145
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,920
Very pretty boys.

146
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,400
Causing all those female students

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,920
to chase Hu Shi around every day to flirt with him.

148
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
Corrupting Peking University's family values.

149
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
In my opinion, a grown boy can't be left idle.

150
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
Look at him, a professor with a doctorate.

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
With a salary of two hundred and eight silver dollars a month.

152
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,240
And crucially, still a bachelor.

153
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,920
No wonder he's attracting gossip.

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,840
Sis, do you want me host that banquet or not?

155
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,280
Wife,

156
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,200
you should get going. We still have work to do.

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
Alright. You all attend to your work then.

158
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,920
I'll leave first.

159
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
Come, let us officially begin the meeting.

160
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,080
Come, everyone.

161
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,640
Sit.

162
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,640
Shizhi,

163
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,760
sit, sit.

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
Esteemed colleagues,

165
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
Today would be

166
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
the first meeting of the editorial committee of "New Youth."

167
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,200
In the past, I was always the chief editor of "New Youth"
[Zhou Zuoren, styled Xingbiao, Peking University Professor]

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
in charge of manuscript requests and submissions.

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,040
From today onwards,

170
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,200
"New Youth" will officially change to a publishing collective.

171
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
Everyone here will be a member of the editorial staff.
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Peking University Professor]

172
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
If no one present has any doubts,

173
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
I propose that we use tea to toast

174
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,200
and celebrate the new birth of "New Youth."

175
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:19,920
Great.

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,400
Here.

177
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,920
Bottoms up.

178
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,960
I wonder if there would be people in the future

179
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
who will remember today's date.

180
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,920
There will be.

181
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
By virtue of our effort.

182
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,920
Have a seat.

183
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,800
Here.

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Having adopted collective editorialship,

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,640
"New Youth" from volume four issue one

186
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
will officially rescind its submission policy.

187
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,200
All submitted manuscripts including articles and translations

188
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
will follow the editorial department's

189
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,600
collective decision-making system.

190
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
With every new issue will be an editorial meeting

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,920
to discuss manuscripts for the next issue.

192
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
An editorial collective still needs one thing.

193
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,240
And I think the candidate must be none other than brother Zhongfu.

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,280
Do we all agree?

195
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,160
I agree.

196
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
Thank you.

197
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm grateful for everyone's trust.

198
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,760
Dear colleagues,

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Our magazine "New Youth" will use Peking University as its base,

200
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,800
have science and democracy for its ensign,

201
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,400
while advocacy of the New Culture movement,

202
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
dissemination of new ideas,

203
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,000
and the nurturing of young people will be its chief objectives.

204
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
The hope is to set off an upsurge that is

205
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
an extensive profound ideological awakening campaign across China

206
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
to seek a scientific path towards national salvation.

207
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,880
I hope as colleagues we will work together as one

208
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,600
to collectively shoulder the burden of this sacred mission.

209
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,320
Your words have warmed my heart.
[Liu Bannong, Peking University professor]

210
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
I want to cry.

211
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,800
It's true, brother Zhongfu.

212
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
For more than four months

213
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040
I travelled in the south.

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
Lobbying everywhere, and everywhere a dead end.

215
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,920
All of China is in a state of paralysis.

216
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
So I think

217
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
enlightening the people

218
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
is "New Youth's" most important task.

219
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,320
Enlightment needs focus and direction.

220
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Advocating for new culture means criticizing old ways of thinking.

221
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,720
"New Culture" 

222
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,600
must target regressive thinking that wants to restore the past.

223
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Unleash an onslaught.

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
Deqian, we can't be too aggressive.

225
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
We will only hurt ourselves.

226
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
No construction without destruction.

227
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,920
If these regressive forces

228
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
are not destroyed

229
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
how can there be new culture?

230
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
The influence and attraction

231
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
of "New Youth" for young people

232
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
is mainly on the basis of its commentary on current events.

233
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,800
I believe manuscripts of this nature need to be enhanced.

234
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
The October Revolution has recently erupted in Russia.

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
I feel this is an important event.

236
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,480
The affairs of Russia are still so far away from us.

237
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,760
We should put our focus

238
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,760
on promoting new culture.

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
I feel we still need to persevere with

240
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,520
the objective brother Zhongfu had

241
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
when he started "New Youth."

242
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
No discussion of politics for twenty years.

243
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
The situation of China currently is

244
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
divided along two governments and two armies.

245
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,920
In these circumstances,

246
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
the political waters are too murky.

247
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
It would be best not to wade into it rashly.

248
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
It is possible to not discuss politics for twenty years?

249
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Gentlemen,

250
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
from the first time you met

251
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,680
you've been arguing over this question.

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
To date, there has still been no victor.

253
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
This issue can be considered at length.

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,680
Take your time discussing it.

255
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
The issue at hand right now

256
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
centres on the New Culture Movement.

257
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
Put out some drafts that carry weight.

258
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Zuoren,

259
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
what have you been working on recently?

260
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
I"m a newcomer here,

261
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
and still need some time to adjust.

262
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
How has Zhou Shuren been doing recently?

263
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
The students are Peking University

264
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
are wearing the school insignia that he designed.

265
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
He can't drift forever

266
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
outside of the new culture movement.

267
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:35,920
Exactly.

268
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,040
He is a major asset.

269
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
Deqian, invite him again.

270
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
The only way to get him to

271
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,520
come out from the mountains is if you were to personally

272
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
set out yourself, I'm afraid.

273
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
Alright, I will call on him some time.

274
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
I will learn from Master Cai and Liu Xuande

275
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
and beg three times for him to leave his hermitage.

276
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,360
Alright.

277
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Let's keep our meeting short and effective,

278
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
and stop here.

279
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,120
Shizhi and Shouchang, please stay.

280
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,200
Everyone else is free to leave.

281
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,280
You're really not inviting us over for a meal?

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
Did I say earlier? Meals not included.

283
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,280
If you have any complaints, talk to Shizhi.

284
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
Shizhi, you must host next time.

285
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Don't bad-mouth me. It'll definitely be my treat.

286
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,680
Try this.

287
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
This isn't filling.

288
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm off, everyone.

289
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Alright.

290
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Take care.

291
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,640
Thank you.

292
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,120
Shouchang,

293
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,160
sit here.

294
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,640
Alright.

295
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
Shizhi, sit here.

296
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,360
I asked the two of you to stay

297
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
because I noticed just now

298
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,560
the two of you have very different thoughts

299
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,760
about managing the publication.

300
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I didn't let you continue earlier

301
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
for fear of disrupting everyone else's ideas.

302
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,760
Now you can discuss it separately.

303
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,080
My reasoning is very simple.

304
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,840
The objective of publishing "New Youth"

305
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
is intellectual enlightenment fundamentally as a way

306
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
as a way to transform the nature of our citizenry for national salvation.

307
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
To use cultural ideas to construct

308
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,960
an innovative base for politics in China,

309
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,520
rather than directly solving political problems.

310
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,960
That is wishful thinking, Shizhi.

311
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
We are living in such a

312
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
magnificient sweeping era.

313
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
How can intellectual enlightenment be discussed

314
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,640
while evading

315
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
the political questions of the country that are a matter of life or death.

316
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,800
Political questions...

317
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Politics are a matter of Machiavellian craft, of transactions.

318
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
It's a dirty kind of game.

319
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,200
It has nothing to do with scholarship.

320
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
That is an intellectual sleight of hand.

321
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,400
Politics is politics. Politicking is politicking.

322
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,120
Two different things.

323
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
If we are interested in intellectual enlightenment

324
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,840
segregated from commentary on current events,

325
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,480
what can it be

326
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,360
besides idle chit-chat?

327
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,160
And what about idle chit-chat?

328
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,000
Idle chit-chat hinders the nation. It has always been so.

329
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
So what is the current situation?

330
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,280
The Beiyang government opposes the government in the south.

331
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,640
Is this not current events?

332
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,160
According to what you're saying

333
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,960
our "New Youth"

334
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,000
ought to pass judgement

335
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,000
on whether the two governments should unite or fight.

336
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,360
If getting mixed with all that

337
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
what you call scholarship?

338
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Big political questions. I'm talking about big political questions.

339
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
The direction of the country, the path to follow.

340
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
Which direction to go.

341
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
This at least must be discussed, no?

342
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Then which direction do you think China ought to follow?

343
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
Recently I've read Chinese and Japanese reports

344
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
about the October Revolution in Russia.

345
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,560
I am deeply inspired.

346
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,840
The Bolshevik Party

347
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,760
seized political power through violent revolution.

348
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
And set off a new revolution in Russia.

349
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
What new revolution?

350
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,120
You just said yourself

351
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
they seized political power through violent revolution.

352
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
It is merely a change in name.

353
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,280
You are too dogmatic, Shizhi.

354
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Have you read their programme?

355
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,320
I've read it.

356
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,040
I think

357
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
it's very helpful for solving China's actual problems.

358
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,240
I've wanted to look into it in recent days.

359
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,000
I am also very interested in Russia's October Revolution.

360
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,480
Let's look into it together.

361
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,920
In terms of development models,

362
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,720
I still propose

363
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,480
that we should fully follow the lead of the United States.

364
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,520
You see,

365
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,040
we talk and talk and always return to the same topic.

366
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,800
In the past, when I said no political dicussions for twenty years,

367
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,640
it was because I didn't want it to be like before again.

368
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
To engage in these political fights.

369
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,320
I want to put all my effort into intellectual enlightenment.

370
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
But intellectual enlightenment is also within the context of politics.

371
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,680
Right now, the theme of "New Youth"

372
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,880
is new culture.

373
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,320
To liberate the citizenry

374
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,240
from old regressive ideas of restoring the previous regime.

375
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,840
Alright, daring vanguards. If I put it that way, do you agree?

376
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,400
I agree.

377
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,340
Do you agree?

378
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,280
I agree.

379
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,720
Old Mr. Lin Shu

380
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
sent word to me

381
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
that he wants to do a lecture
[Reading Building Humanities teaching and research section]

382
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,240
at Peking University.

383
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
He wants to discuss the Tongcheng prose school.

384
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,600
Lin Shu?

385
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,000
He should lecture on the great Western canon.

386
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Why is he talking about the Tongchen school?

387
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
This is a clear challenge.

388
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
This Gu Tangsheng* got something started.
[Gu Hongming's birth name]

389
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
All at once,

390
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,200
he got the students and teachers

391
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
interested in academic scholarship.

392
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm thinking

393
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,480
you gentlemen had better pull yourselves together.

394
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
Otherwise, you'll cede the field.

395
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,840
How could we cede the field?

396
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
We are all soldiers here.

397
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,880
Shizhi,

398
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
why don't you tell the gentleman

399
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
about your thoughts.

400
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm still working on it.

401
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Don't be modest. Go ahead.

402
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
The point of holding lecture

403
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,640
is to disseminate new ideas.

404
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
But where to start?

405
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
It's truly a puzzle.

406
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
The current political situation is very chaotic.

407
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,840
There are many social issues.

408
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
The focal point of young students' concerns

409
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,720
is the direction of China.

410
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
Therefore, I'm also very conflicted

411
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,600
about the lecture series.

412
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,280
Should it discuss current events?

413
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
Or academic scholarship?

414
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,640
Shizhi, I really would like to

415
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
debate you on this topic.

416
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,520
In my view, current events and academic scholarship -

417
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:49,920
Shouchang.

418
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,240
You -

419
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,800
Now is not the time for debate.

420
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
This thing about "No discussion of politics for twenty years" -

421
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,720
when I first started

422
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,280
"New Youth,"

423
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
it was a tenet of the publication.

424
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
However, what is politics?

425
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320


426
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,680


427
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,200


428
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,040


429
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,880


430
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800


431
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,560


432
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,920


433
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320


434
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,920


435
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080


436
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,520


437
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040


438
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560


439
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,560


440
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040


441
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,280


442
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,320


443
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,520


444
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,600


445
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960


446
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,720


447
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,120
