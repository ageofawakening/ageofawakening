00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:19,920
Great.

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,400
Here.

188
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,920
Bottoms up.

189
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,960
I wonder if there would be people in the future

190
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
who will remember today's date.

191
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,920
There will be.

192
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
By virtue of our effort.

193
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,920
Have a seat.

194
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,800
Here.

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Having adopted collective editorialship,

196
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,640
"New Youth" from volume four issue one

197
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
will officially rescind its submission policy.

198
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,200
All submitted manuscripts including articles and translations

199
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
will follow the editorial department's

200
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,600
collective decision-making system.

201
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
With every new issue will be an editorial meeting

202
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,920
to discuss manuscripts for the next issue.

203
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
An editorial collective still needs one thing.

204
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,240
And I think the candidate must be none other than brother Zhongfu.

205
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,280
Do we all agree?

206
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,160
I agree.

207
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
Thank you.

208
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm grateful for everyone's trust.

209
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,760
Dear colleagues,

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Our magazine "New Youth" will use Peking University as its base,

211
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,800
have science and democracy for its ensign,

212
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,400
while advocacy of the New Culture movement,

213
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
dissemination of new ideas,

214
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,000
and the nurturing of young people will be its chief objectives.

215
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
The hope is to set off an upsurge that is

216
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
an extensive profound ideological awakening campaign across China

217
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
to seek a scientific path towards national salvation.

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,880
I hope as colleagues we will work together as one

219
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,600
to collectively shoulder the burden of this sacred mission.

220
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,320
Your words have warmed my heart.

221
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:46,117
[Liu Bannong, Professor at Peking University]

222
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
I want to cry.

223
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,800
It's true, brother Zhongfu.

224
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
For more than four months

225
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040
I travelled in the south.

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
Lobbying everywhere, and everywhere a dead end.

227
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,920
All of China is in a state of paralysis.

228
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
So I think

229
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
enlightening the people

230
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
is "New Youth's" most important task.

231
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,320
Enlightment needs focus and direction.

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Advocating for New Culture means criticizing old ways of thinking.

233
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,720
"New Culture"

234
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,600
must target regressive thinking that wants to restore the past.

235
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Unleash an onslaught.

236
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
Deqian, we can't be too aggressive.

237
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
We will only hurt ourselves.

238
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
No construction without destruction.

239
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,920
If these regressive forces

240
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
are not destroyed

241
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
how can there be New Culture?

242
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
The influence and attraction

243
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
of "New Youth" for young people

244
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
is mainly on the basis of its commentary on current events.

245
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,800
I believe manuscripts of this nature need to be enhanced.

246
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
The October Revolution has recently erupted in Russia.

247
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
I feel this is an important event.

248
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,480
The affairs of Russia are still so far away from us.

249
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,760
We should put our focus

250
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,760
on promoting New Culture.

251
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
I feel we still need to persevere with

252
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,520
the objective brother Zhongfu had

253
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
when he started "New Youth."

254
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
No discussion of politics for twenty years.

255
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
The situation of China currently is

256
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
divided along two governments and two armies.

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,920
In these circumstances,

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
the political waters are too murky.

259
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
It would be best not to wade into it rashly.

260
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
It is possible to not discuss politics for twenty years?

261
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Gentlemen,

262
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
from the first time you met

263
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,680
you've been arguing over this question.

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
To date, there has still been no victor.

265
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
This issue can be considered at length.

266
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,680
Take your time discussing it.

267
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
The issue at hand right now

268
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
centres on the New Culture Movement.

269
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
Put out some drafts that carry weight.

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Zuoren,

271
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
what have you been working on recently?

272
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
I'm a newcomer here,

273
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
and still need some time to adjust.

274
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
How has Zhou Shuren been doing recently?

275
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
The students are Peking University

276
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
are wearing the school insignia that he designed.

277
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
He can't drift forever

278
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
outside of the New Culture movement.

279
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:35,920
Exactly.

280
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,040
He is a major asset.

281
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
Deqian, invite him again.

282
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
The only way to get him to

283
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,520
come out from the mountains is if you were to personally

284
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
set out yourself, I'm afraid.

285
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
Alright, I will call on him some time.

286
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
I will learn from Master Cai and Liu Xuande

287
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
and beg three times for him to leave his hermitage.

288
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,360
Alright.

289
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Let's keep our meeting short and effective,

290
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
and stop here.

291
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,120
Shizhi and Shouchang, please stay.

292
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,200
Everyone else is free to leave.

293
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,280
You're really not inviting us over for a meal?

294
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
Did I say earlier? Meals not included.

295
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,280
If you have any complaints, talk to Shizhi.

296
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
Shizhi, you must host next time.

297
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Don't bad-mouth me. It'll definitely be my treat.

298
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,680
Try this.

299
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
This isn't filling.

300
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm off, everyone.

301
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Alright.

302
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Take care.

303
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,640
Thank you.

304
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,120
Shouchang,

305
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,160
sit here.

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,640
Alright.

307
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
Shizhi, sit here.

308
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,360
I asked the two of you to stay

309
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
because I noticed just now

310
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,560
the two of you have very different thoughts

311
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,760
about managing the publication.

312
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I didn't let you continue earlier

313
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
for fear of disrupting everyone else's ideas.

314
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,760
Now you can discuss it separately.

315
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,080
My reasoning is very simple.

316
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,840
The objective of publishing "New Youth"

317
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
is intellectual enlightenment fundamentally as a way

318
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
as a way to transform the nature of our citizenry for national salvation.

319
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
To use cultural ideas to construct

320
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,960
an innovative base for politics in China,

321
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,520
rather than directly solving political problems.

322
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,960
That is wishful thinking, Shizhi.

323
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
We are living in such a

324
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
magnificient sweeping era.

325
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
How can intellectual enlightenment be discussed

326
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,640
while evading

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
the political questions of the country that are a matter of life or death.

328
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,800
Political questions...

329
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Politics are a matter of Machiavellian craft, of transactions.

330
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
It's a dirty kind of game.

331
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,200
It has nothing to do with scholarship.

332
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
That is an intellectual sleight of hand.

333
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,400
Politics is politics. Politicking is politicking.

334
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,120
Two different things.

335
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
If we are interested in intellectual enlightenment

336
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,840
segregated from commentary on current events,

337
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,480
what can it be

338
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,360
besides idle chit-chat?

339
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,160
And what about idle chit-chat?

340
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,000
Idle chit-chat hinders the nation. It has always been so.

341
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
So what is the current situation?

342
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,280
The Beiyang government opposes the government in the south.

343
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,640
Is this not current events?

344
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,160
According to what you're saying

345
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,960
our "New Youth"

346
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,000
ought to pass judgement

347
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,000
on whether the two governments should unite or fight.

348
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,360
If getting mixed with all that

349
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
what you call scholarship?

350
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Big political questions. I'm talking about big political questions.

351
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
The direction of the country, the path to follow.

352
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
Which direction to go.

353
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
This at least must be discussed, no?

354
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Then which direction do you think China ought to follow?

355
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
Recently I've read Chinese and Japanese reports

356
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
about the October Revolution in Russia.

357
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,560
I am deeply inspired.

358
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,840
The Bolshevik Party

359
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,760
seized political power through violent revolution.

360
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
And set off a new revolution in Russia.

361
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
What new revolution?

362
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,120
You just said yourself

363
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
they seized political power through violent revolution.

364
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
It is merely a change in name.

365
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,280
You are too dogmatic, Shizhi.

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Have you read their programme?

367
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,320
I've read it.

368
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,040
I think

369
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
it's very helpful for solving China's actual problems.

370
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,240
I've wanted to look into it in recent days.

371
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,000
I am also very interested in Russia's October Revolution.

372
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,480
Let's look into it together.

373
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,920
In terms of development models,

374
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,720
I still propose

375
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,480
that we should fully follow the lead of the United States.

376
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,520
You see,

377
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,040
we talk and talk and always return to the same topic.

378
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,800
In the past, when I said no political dicussions for twenty years,

379
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,640
it was because I didn't want it to be like before again.

380
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
To engage in these political fights.

381
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,320
I want to put all my effort into intellectual enlightenment.

382
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
But intellectual enlightenment is also within the context of politics.

383
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,680
Right now, the theme of "New Youth"

384
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,880
is New Culture.

385
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,320
To liberate the citizenry

386
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,240
from old regressive ideas of restoring the previous regime.

387
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,840
Alright, daring vanguards. If I put it that way, do you agree?

388
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,400
I agree.

389
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,340
Do you agree?

390
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,280
I agree.

391
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,720
Old Mr. Lin Shu

392
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
sent word to me

393
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
that he wants to do a lecture

394
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:46,885
[Red Building Humanities Teaching and Research Section]

395
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,240
at Peking University.

396
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
He wants to discuss the Tongcheng prose school.

397
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,600
Lin Shu?

398
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,000
He should lecture on the great Western canon.

399
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Why is he talking about the Tongchen school?

400
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
This is a clear challenge.

401
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
This Gu Tangsheng got something started.

402
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
All at once,

403
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,200
he got the students and teachers

404
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
interested in academic scholarship.

405
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm thinking

406
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,480
you gentlemen had better pull yourselves together.

407
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
Otherwise, you'll cede the field.

408
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,840
How could we cede the field?

409
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
We are all soldiers here.

410
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,880
Shizhi,

411
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
why don't you tell the gentleman

412
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
about your thoughts.

413
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm still working on it.

414
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Don't be modest. Go ahead.

415
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
The point of holding lecture

416
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,640
is to disseminate new ideas.

417
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
But where to start?

418
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
It's truly a puzzle.

419
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
The current political situation is very chaotic.

420
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,840
There are many social issues.

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
The focal point of young students' concerns

422
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,720
is the direction of China.

423
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
Therefore, I'm also very conflicted

424
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,600
about the lecture series.

425
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,280
Should it discuss current events?

426
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
Or academic scholarship?

427
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,640
Shizhi, I really would like to

428
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
debate you on this topic.

429
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,520
In my view, current events and academic scholarship -

430
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:49,920
Shouchang.

431
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,240
You -

432
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,800
Now is not the time for debate.

433
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
This thing about "No discussion of politics for twenty years" -

434
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,720
when I first started

435
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,280
"New Youth,"

436
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
it was a tenet of the publication.

437
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
However, what is politics?

438
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320
It's hard to define.

439
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,680
In retrospect,

440
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,200
a lot of what "New Youth" discussed

441
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,040
turned out to be current affairs.

442
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,880
What most of the readers are interested in turned out to be current affairs as well.

443
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
So as far as I can see,

444
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,560
since we are trying to gain more positions,

445
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,920
we've got to have an objective,

446
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
something that the younger generation cares about the most at the moment.

447
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,920
I agree.

448
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080
There's no need to confine ourselves.

449
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,520
We should simply discuss 

450
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040
whatever people are most interested in.

451
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560
Don't be hedged in rules and regulations.

452
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,560
Please come in.

453
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040
Sir,

454
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,280
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for you with urgent matters. 

455
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,320
Shall we...

456
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,520
Just say it here.

457
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,600
There is no need to keep it away from the others.

458
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
Minister Wang said on the phone

459
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,720
the British professor Cartwright, who was dismissed by our university,

460
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
wrote to the British Prime Minister 

461
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,120
and complained about Peking University.

462
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,600
The British embassy presented a note to the Republican government.

463
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,040
It startled Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui.

464
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,360
Minister Wang said that you have caused big trouble this time.

465
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
That's why he wanted to see you immediately.

466
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
Okay, I'm aware of that now.

467
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040
But the matter of dismissing Cartwright 

468
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,640
is supposed to be relevant to the Ministry of Education. 

469
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
Why is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs getting involved now?

470
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
Anyway, go prepare the sedan for me please.

471
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,080
Brother Zhongfu, sit down first.

472
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm leaving for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now.

473
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
As for the lecture series,

474
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,800
I think it's better to call them academic lectures.

475
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,880
Let's try to limit the theme to New Culture.

476
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,600
Specifically, we can focus on topics like writing characters reform,

477
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,440
vernacular essays, vernacular poems,

478
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,000
even funeral affairs or folk customs. 

479
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,840
But for politics,

480
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,920
let's try to avoid that,

481
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
in case the government intervenes.

482
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,120
This include 

483
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
Sun Yat-sen's military government,

484
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
the melee of war lords, and such.

485
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,960
We should refrain from talking about all of these.

486
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
In such an eventful and precarious time,

487
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,640
we can easily get in troubles.

488
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,760
Let's not discuss politics.

489
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,200
Zhongfu,

490
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,520
you're still in charge of the discussions.

491
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,200
Everyone here can participate,

492
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,880
and feel free to pick your own topics,

493
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,520
as long as we form a New Culture-themes lecture series.

494
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,360
I'll also join you.

495
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,160
Sir,

496
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,520
we don't wish to continue the discussion anymore.

497
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,880
I just want to ask

498
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,720
how can the British Government interfere

499
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
with our dismissal of Cartwright?

500
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,320
And how can we simply allow such interference to happen?

501
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm not aware of the details myself.

502
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
This is why I need to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now.

503
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,320
Alright.

504
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,200
Department of Liberal Arts has to be mentally prepared anyway.

505
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,160
I think there's going to be a lawsuit.

506
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,440
I'm leaving.

507
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,200
Shizhi, with regard to the discussion of academics and current affairs 

508
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
this is what I think...

509
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,120
Hang on a moment,

510
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,560
let's not talk about 

511
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,920
that for now.

512
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's talk about Cartwright instead.

513
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,480
Good point.

514
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,720
This is the actual position gaining.

515
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,400
Sit down please.

516
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,760
Preposterous!

517
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,800
It doesn't make any sense.

518
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
How come they're poking their nose

519
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,320
into our internal affairs?

520
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,080
The most ridiculous part is that

521
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,920
we dismissed him for fair reasons.

522
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,520
How can he complain about us?

523
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Brother Jiemin, you're finally here!

524
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
It seems that the chancellor of Peking University 

525
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
is much busier than me!

526
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
How can I compare to you?

527
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,000
Whenever master Wang speaks

528
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
the humble me, Cai Yuanpei, will have to rush down here in a split second.

529
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,400
Alright then,

530
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
please state your instructions.

531
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,720
If it's not for something extremely urgent,

532
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,720
I wouldn't have disturbed Chancellor Cai.

533
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
The dismissal of the foreign professor at Peking University

534
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,240
caused big trouble.

535
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,440
Cartwright turned out to be a descendant of British aristocracy. 

536
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
He wrote to their Prime Minister Lloyd-George

537
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,800
complaining about you Cai Yuanpei overstepping your authority, your breaching of contract

538
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
and discrimination against British citizens.

539
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,040
He's demanding apologies, compensation and resumption of their posts

540
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,360
for both himself and other discharged British personnel 

541
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
from Peking University.

542
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,000
Lloyd-George 

543
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,840
assigned the British Envoy 

544
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,000
John Newell Jordan to handle this complaint.

545
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,600
The British Embassy 

546
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,600
had already presented a note to our government.

547
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,040
Both Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui 

548
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,920
had ordered me to take care of this matter immediately.

549
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,080
Brother Botang, this sounds really interesting to me.

550
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,800
Peking University is a Chinese national university.

551
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,240
The hiring and discharging of teaching personnel 

552
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
are the rights and responsibilities entrusted by the state.

553
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,080
How are these relevant to 

554
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
British Prime Minister and British embassy?

555
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
Furthermore, there were prior cases of

556
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,200
discharging foreign personnel 

557
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beiyang University and other schools.

558
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,200
There has never been any issues before.

559
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
Why is it all of a sudden a big trouble

560
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
when I'm involved? 

561
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,600
Cartwright complaint about you based on two grounds:

562
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,760
one is that his contract at Peking university

563
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
was signed by Ministry of Education.

564
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
Peking University has no authority to terminate his contract.

565
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
The other is that the term of his contract is 4 years.

566
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
What Peking University is doing now is breaching of contract,

567
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,120
which is illegal.

568
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,560
This is simple.

569
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
We can terminate his contract through Ministry of Education.

570
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
As for breach of contract, that is sheer nonsense.

571
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,680
The contract has it written in black and white:

572
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
those who are incompetent at their jobs,

573
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,360
and those who violated the school's regulations

574
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
can be discharged.

575
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
Strictly speaking,

576
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,360
his incompetency at teaching duties 

577
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,880
caused losses to our university.

578
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,320
It was HIM who breached the contract.

579
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
We're supposed to hold HIM accountable.

580
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,800
Brother Jiemin,

581
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
the situation is for more complicated than what you imagined.

582
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,800
The British Embassy presented a note of protest,

583
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,160
and turned the case into a diplomatic event.

584
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
There's no small matter in diplomacy,

585
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,440
not to mention during times of war.

586
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,680
Duan Qirui asked me to tell you

587
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,760
our government had already declared to join the world war.

588
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,400
Both China and Britain are Allies.

589
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,560
We're are on the same boat.

590
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,360
He hopes Peking University would focus on the big picture 

591
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
and wouldn't harm the relationship 

592
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,040
between China and Britain because of this matter.

593
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,960
It seems like this actually caused some troubles.

594
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
Some big troubles.

595
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,120
Otherwise I wouldn't have anxiously urged you to come here.

596
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,920
If you didn't show up,

597
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,520
I would have visited you anyway.

598
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,080
Okay then.

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,640
You're the mastermind, you tell me what to do.

600
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,520
The first big step towards Peking University's reform got tripped.

601
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
Can you tell me how can I continue my jobs as the chancellor?

602
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,120
Not to mention 

603
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,160
it concerns the our national dignity and general fairness, 

604
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,760
how am I supposed to explain this to the students and faculties of our university?

605
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,040
Brother Jiemin, I understand your difficulties.

606
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,560
But this is 

607
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,120
indeed a thorny issue

608
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,840
that is not likely to be resolved all by your sole will.

609
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,720
I think it's better not to act on impulse.

610
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
Why don't you go back and discuss the issue with your faculties?

611
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
Once you guys reached a consensus, 

612
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
we can discuss the plans for the next steps.

613
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Brother Botang,

614
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,160
Discharging unqualified foreign personnel 

615
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
like Cartwright 

616
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,360
was a decision collectively made by the appraisal committee of Peking University!

617
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,800
To overthrow this decision,

618
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,360
it has to go through the school appraisal committee,

619
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,640
As far as I can tell,

620
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,680
it is almost impossible to revoked.

621
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
Brother Jiemin,

622
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,160
I invited you here

623
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,400
to follow the orders and carry out my duties.

624
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,080
Likewise, your conveying the message to your employees

625
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
can be considered as fulfilling your duties.

626
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,400
Exactly how you're going to do it

627
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,200
is Peking University's liberty.

628
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
We'll talk further after you guys make up your mind.

629
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,960
Is that alright?

630
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
Jiang, we're not going back to Peking University.

631
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,480
Let's go directly to Ministry of Education.

632
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,920
Ya!

633
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,960
Zhongfu, you guys are both here.

634
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,680
Mr. Cai.

635
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,320
It's good that you're both here.

636
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,280
I'm glad you happen to arrive.

637
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,160
We created a program

638
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,840
for the New Culture lecture series.

639
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
All of the topics are substantial. 

640
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,920
Mr. Cai.

641
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
Brother Zhongfu, can I have some water?

642
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,600
Mr. Cai.

643
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
What happened.

644
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,840
Shouchang, 

645
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
please use a large bowl.

646
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
You two can take a look.

647
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,280
Zhongfu, Zhongfu, Brother Zhongfu.

648
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
Gangster logic!

649
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,440
Zhongfu, you cannot do this!

650
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,640
Pushing us too hard!

651
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,080
We can't do this!

652
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,840
This is the copy of démarche.  

653
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,280
We only have this one copy.

654
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
We cannot destroy it!

655
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,400
Let's hurry up and discuss 

656
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,920
how to cope with this.

657
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
Pay no attention to it! Do things in our own ways!

658
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
I knew you'd have this kind of response.

659
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,160
Isn't that your response as well?

660
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
This matter is rather complicated.

661
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
This fellow Cartwright had written a complaint

662
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,560
to his Prime Minister Lloyd-George. 

663
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,680
Lloyd-George gave his orders 

664
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,880
to the British Envoy Jordan. 

665
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,280
And the Envoy Jordan presented a note 

666
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
to our government.

667
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
This whole thing turned into a diplomatic event.

668
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,680
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui of our government 

669
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,680
both gave specific orders.

670
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,240
So did Ministry of Education.

671
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
What about the position Peking University should take?

672
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,160
They only gave us 7 words:

673
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,280
consider the big picture, minimize the problems.

674
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,480
How can we minimize it?

675
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,840
We've already put up the public notice!

676
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,240
The die is cast. Can we simply eat our own words?

677
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,160
This is why I said it's a thorny issue.

678
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,600
I have already inform the school

679
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,360
to have a appraisal committee meeting tomorrow morning,

680
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,240
to discuss this matter.

681
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,360
What is there to be discussed?

682
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
Are we supposed to surrender out sovereignty rights under humiliating terms?

683
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,120
Are we supposed to surrender to the foreigners?

684
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,280
Mr. Cai, we have to take this matter seriously!

685
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:33,775
Du Qirui exhorted again and again,

686
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
saying that 

687
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,040
during this time of war, Britain is our ally.

688
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,280
We save their face, instead of saving a little only to lose a lot

689
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
and harm the interest of the nation.

690
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,640
It is sovereignty that is the biggest interest of a nation.

691
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
Who is right, who is wrong? There's no need to debate.

692
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,720
You're right.

693
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Okay then, now that it is a diplomatic event,

694
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,840
our Peking University and Cartwright 

695
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,440
can be seen as the representatives of the interests of our nations.

696
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Our Peking University holds in her one hand the national honor 

697
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,600
the other had general fairness.

698
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
Losing either one of these

699
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,360
would be a crime to our nation.

700
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
Well-said Zhongfu!

701
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
Let's talk about it right now

702
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
how are we going to hold 

703
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,680
the school appraisal committee meeting tomorrow.

704
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,560
Alright?

705
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,480
Sure!

706
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,880
Everybody, the current situation is not optimistic.

707
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,360
Cartwright had already demanded that

708
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,600
Peking University apologize to him, offer him compensation

709
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,400
and revoke our decision to dismiss him.

710
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,240
At the same time, the British Embassy presented a note to our government.

711
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,640
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui here

712
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,240
gave us direct orders.

713
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,920
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education both

714
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,160
asked us to resolve the issue in a short period of time.

715
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,560
Just now the Minister of Education Fu Zengxiang called

716
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,160
and said the British Embassy

717
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,320
is waiting for our response.

718
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,080
What should Peking University do?

719
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,480
To surrender or to fight?

720
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
Please state your opinions.

721
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,840
Let's start from Zhongfu.

722
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,360
After I learned what happened from Mr. Cai,

723
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,400
I was furious. 

724
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
This suddenly brought my mind 

725
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,680
back to the Opium War happened more than 70 years ago.

726
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,280
How did the Western invaders bully our China?

727
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,680
How did they plunder our nation?

728
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Even back then, 

729
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,440
the British government 

730
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
used the excuse of protecting British citizens in China

731
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
to open the gate of our country 

732
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
with their powerful navy and advanced weaponry.

733
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,840
Our Chinese nation thus started to decline.

734
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Today, they are playing their same old tricks.

735
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,280
Again, using protecting their citizen in China as an excuse, 

736
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,560
they are even trying to interfere with

737
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,480
the internal affairs of our university!

738
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,920
What is this?

739
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,000
Plain robbery!

740
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,160
If this can be tolerated, what cannot?

741
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,160
My view is pretty clear,

742
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Peking University cannot surrender!

743
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,600
If we do, we'll become sinners to our own history.

744
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,680
Dear colleagues,

745
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,560
I came back to my motherland all the way from the United States.

746
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,400
All I wanted is to be

747
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,080
an upright and dignified Chinese. 

748
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,080
What the British is doing is too absurd.

749
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,800
If we have to surrender to 

750
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,240
this type of shameful request,

751
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,560
how can we still talk about sovereignty and national dignity?

752
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
That way we won't even have the most basic human dignity!

753
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,560
Indeed!

754
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,840
This is absurd!

755
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,600
We'll never surrender!

756
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
Everybody, listen to me.

757
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,320
To shoulder our responsibilities to Peking University,

758
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,960
can we come up with a sure card

759
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,160
just in case.

760
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,040
Rest assured!

761
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,240
Last night, Shouchang read through 

762
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,000
all the references related to this case.

763
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,560
I suggest we listen to him.

764
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,920
Shouchang, please.

765
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,720
Alright.

766
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Dear committee members,

767
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,680
I traced back and referred to the Peking University Education Reform Proposal

768
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,440
Mr. Cai had submitted to Ministry of Education when he took office.

769
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,400
One of stipulations specified that

770
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Peking University has the right to independently decide upon

771
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,760
the employing and discharging of teaching personnel. 

772
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,720
This whole proposal was approved by

773
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,840
the then President of the Republic Li Yuanhong,

774
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
which means it has legal effect.

775
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,440
Besides, I looked through the approval document 

776
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,080
from Ministry of Education with regard to

777
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,000
Peking University forming its appraisal committee.

778
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,360
One of the stipulations stated, 

779
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,440
Peking University Appraisal Committee 

780
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,960
may base on actual circumstances 

781
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,640
dismiss unqualified teaching personnel. 

782
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,480
These two should suffice to prove 

783
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,600
Cartwright's litigation is complete nonsense. 

784
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,800
Shouchang,

785
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,000
I can tell that

786
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
you must have stayed up all night yesterday.

787
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,600
But I can assure you that you won't have stayed up for nothing!

788
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,200
Mr. Cai, it's my responsibility.

789
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,720
Mr. Cai.

790
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,160
Please speak.

791
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,560
I have researched on some similar cases from overseas.

792
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,160
For cases like these,

793
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,480
we can get the school to organise a professors' union

794
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
to have a disucssion with the related parties' embassy.

795
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,320
We will utilize diplomatic relations to mediate.

796
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,440
If mediation fails,

797
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,560
we will then go to the courts to file a lawsuit.

798
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,320
Zhongfu,

799
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,680
it seems like these people

800
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,840
did not sleep a wink last night.

801
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,200
Mr. Cai

802
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,920
Those who could not sleep last night

803
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,280
were not just us.

804
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,840
Deqian, Bannong, Yihan,

805
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,160
and students Guo Xingang, Deng Zhongxia.

806
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,800
Many students spent the whole night

807
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,920
at the liberal arts office doing research.

808
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,600
Deng Zhongxia and the students still did drafting.

809
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,440
Students of Peking University

810
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,840
drafted a a letter of resistance to the British Embassy

811
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,320
and an open letter to the Beiyang Government

812
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,920
in case of need.

813
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,160
I, Cai Yuanpei, have done a good job as President of Peking University.

814
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,680
I thank everyone for their support.

815
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,960
Alright.

816
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,280
Since everyone is on the same page,

817
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,280
there is no need to continue debating.

818
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
I will call Fu Zengxiang immediately

819
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,000
to tell him Peking University's stance.

820
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,560
Also, everyone should prepare

821
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,840
to quickly organise the professors and student unions

822
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,280
and get ready.

823
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,680
Mr. Zhongfu will be in charge of this matter.

824
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,360
Does anyone have any objections?

825
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,240
No!

826
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
Brother Botang, I am reporting that

827
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,920
Peking University Committee members

828
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,640
strongly disagree with Cartwright's

829
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,560
and the British Embassy's appeal.

830
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,720
We must protect our country's sovereignty

831
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,480
and Peking University's rights.

832
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,600
Alright.

833
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,480
So, you are clear about

834
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,280
the consequences of your actions

835
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,560
and have a plan of action?

836
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,720
Aren't I here to ask for your help?

837
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,160
Tell me.

838
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,360
What should we do?

839
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
First you will have to obtain

840
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,560
Fu Zengxiang's empathy and support.

841
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,920
I have already spoken with him.

842
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,280
What did he say?

843
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,520
He just said he would resign.

844
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,840
He is trying to shirk responsibility.

845
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,200
Regardless,

846
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,880
I am still thankful to the both of you.

847
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,320
Look,

848
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,960
I'll treat you to lunch this afternoon,

849
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,680
alright?

850
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,440
Sure, you.

851
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,560
Openly trying to woo key government officials.

852
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,000
Please just do me this favour.

853
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,120
Alright.

854
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,680
Come!

855
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,440
Please come in!

856
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,080
How are the both of you?

857
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
You just sampled our Shaoxing cuisine.

858
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,920
Does it suit your palate?

859
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,400
We are obliged to help you since you have treated us.

860
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,920
What schemes do you have?

861
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,880
Duan Qirui is going to listen to the reports this afternoon.

862
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,640
If we can't get through this obstacle,

863
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,800
both of us will have to resign.

864
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,760
That's right.

865
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,920
This issue is urgent and serious.

866
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,440
This morning, Jordan

867
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,280
called three times to ask about the outcome.

868
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,880
Alright.

869
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,360
Please drink some tea.

870
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,480
If that's the case,

871
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,720
let me explain the situation to the both of you.

872
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,720
I will be honest,

873
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
Peking University Committee members,

874
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,600
none of them are cowards.

875
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,440
The meeting this morning,

876
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,040
before I finished speaking,

877
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,320
the whole atmosphere was tense.

878
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,160
Everyone decided

879
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,480
to fight till the end.

880
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,120
We will never embarrass this country and Peking University.

881
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,400
So how do you plan to fight?

882
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,560
We will form a professor's union and have discussions with the British Embassy.

883
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,760
What if you don't come to a conclusion?

884
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,560
We will then go to court.

885
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,480
What about Duan Qirui?

886
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,240
He is a temperamental warlord.

887
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,440
Yuanshu, Duan Qirui is still Chinese after all.

888
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
He can't possibly betray his ancestors

889
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:08,723
when he asks for it.

890
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,480
We will reason with him.

891
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,560
I don't think he will be receptive to

892
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,120
those pathetic idelogies of yours.

893
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,080
What are you saying?

894
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,240
How are they pathetic?

895
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,400
Firstly, we have documents about the two governments.

896
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,160
It is enough to prove that

897
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,880
Cartwright's dismissal is legal.

898
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
Secondly, we have strong evidence

899
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,280
to prove that Cartwright's dismissal is logical.

900
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,280
As a government official,

901
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,200
Duan Qirui will be

902
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
the one who protects our rights.

903
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,240
He will not betray us, right?

904
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,080
I can say this very confidently,

905
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,480
Duan Qirui will never pay heed to

906
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,400
whatever you are suggesting.

907
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,120
Cai Jiemin, don't try to fool us.

908
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Please reveal what you have up your sleeve.

909
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
You know me so well, Brother Botang.

910
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,760
Apart from the evidence I mentioned,

911
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,240
we will give Premier Duan

912
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,080
two things.

913
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,640
The first is a letter written by Peking University staff and students

914
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,880
to the government.

915
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,680
The other item is a letter of resistance

916
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,480
written by Peking University students to the British Embassy.

917
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
Are you sure these items are useful?

918
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,640
Of course.

919
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,280
Cai Jiemin, you are good.

920
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,280
This is sly of you.

921
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,480
You have targeted Duan Qirui's weak spot.

922
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,000
Minister Fu,

923
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,080
take these items with you

924
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,280
when you meet Duan Qirui in the afternoon.

925
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
I guarantee you he will not only be able control his anger,

926
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,600
he will also beg for your help.

927
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
At that time, tell him to look for me.

928
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,280
Both of you are making me confused.

929
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,480
This matter cannot be clear enough.

930
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,640
Duan Qirui knows how important this matter is.

931
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,240
I never thought

932
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,240
Brother Jiemin could be so cunning.

933
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,720
I'm in awe of you.

934
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,160
Please don't.

935
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,320
I learned it all from him.

936
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,360
You take on the characteristics of those closest to you.

937
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,880
Both of you are sly as foxes.

938
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,040
Zhongfu.

939
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,000
Master Cai.

940
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,040
Mr. Cai.

941
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,160
Quickly.

942
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,200
Inside.

943
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,520
Brother Zhongfu.

944
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,800
Good news.

945
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,160
Shouchang.

946
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,320
Shouchang, you still remember me.

947
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,880
Mr. Cai, what good news do you bring?

948
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,720
Duan Qirui approved of our idea.

949
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
He wants Peking University's professor's union

950
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,200
to quickly hold talks with the British embassy

951
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,880
to resolve Cartwright's issue.

952
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,520
Alright.

953
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,200
Also, Fu Zengxiang mentioned

954
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,850
Duan Qirui emphasised that

955
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
he does not want Peking University students

956
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,520
to protest in the streets,

957
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,200
or to attack the embassy,

958
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,880
and to avoid confrontations with the foreigners.

959
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,760
Wang Daxie also mentioned just now,

960
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,240
he wants us to quickly prepare the materials for the talks,

961
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
he has arranged to meet with Jordan.

962
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,080
Now the materials and evidence have been prepared

963
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,080
The backup team will be led by Deng Zhongxia

964
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
together with Fu Sinian.

965
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,440
The students are very enthusiastic.

966
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,840
Just that regarding those involved in the talks,

967
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,960
I am still thinking of who should go.

968
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
At first I was thinking that Shizhi,

969
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
Shouchang and I will be a group.

970
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,600
Shizhi will be the main speaker,

971
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
Shouchang will be in charge of the materials.

972
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,120
Wonderful.

973
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,600
Brother Zhongfu.

974
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
I have a small suggestion.

975
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:07,920
Please share.

976
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
See if you can get Gu Hongming to join.

977
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
His English is good.

978
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,440
and another reason

979
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,240
Gu Hongming has influence overseas,

980
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,640
especially those foreigners in China.

981
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,480
They respect him a lot.

982
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,160
We did think about that,

983
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,680
but we thought he was too eccentric.

984
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,800
He has many idiosyncrasies.

985
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
We are afraid he will not agree to come

986
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,640
and also that he will come and make a scene.

987
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,960
It seems that you don't know Gu Hongming

988
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,400
He really

989
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,040
detests those arrogant foreigners.

990
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
If he gets wind of this matter,

991
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,600
ask him to fight

992
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,360
against foreigners with ulterior motives.

993
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,640
One is that he is experienced,

994
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
and the other is that he will definitely be enthusiastic.

995
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,280
Of course Gu Hongming has his quirks.

996
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,640
He likes to keep score.

997
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,120
When you go to invite him,

998
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,960
please humble yourself and say some flattering words.

999
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,760
Zhongfu, if you treat him to a meal,

1000
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,000
if he has any requests,

1001
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,000
try your best to fulfill them.

1002
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,920
Alright, I will try.

1003
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,920
To be, or not to be,

1004
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:24,447
[Gu Hongming, born Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

1005
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,000
that is the question:

1006
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,920
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

1007
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,280
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,

1008
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
And by

1009
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
opposing end them.

1010
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,400
This is what the great British writer

1011
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,240
Shakespeare wrote in "Hamlet".

1012
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,720
A famous monologue

1013
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,960
and the Danish Prince Hamlet's

1014
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,520
reflection on his life and destiny.

1015
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
I want to ask all the students seated,

1016
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,400
who has thought about such issues.

1017
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,920
You should seriously reflect on this question

1018
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,960
because the answer to this will be your life's purpose.

1019
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,200
With the correct life purpose,

1020
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,760
your life will have a direction,

1021
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,400
you will have a bright future.

1022
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,800
We study English poems

1023
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,240
and the English language

1024
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,600
to be able to expouse Chinese values

1025
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,880
and our gentle yet meaningful poems

1026
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,040
to far flung lands.

1027
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Those who cannot remember will continue to stand.

1028
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,360
Thank you Professor.

1029
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,920
That's all for today.

1030
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Goodbye teacher.

1031
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
Sir.

1032
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,840
Guests?

1033
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,240
Professor Gu.

1034
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,200
Are you here to learn English?

1035
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,320
Or?

1036
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,280
Professor Gu, we are here to seek you as a master.

1037
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,520
How interesting.

1038
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,760
You speak in the vernacular,

1039
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,400
yet come here to learn English poems.

1040
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,360
Doesn't make sense.
