00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,336
[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:01,336 --> 00:00:04,283
[Episode Seventeen]

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,640
If you, Sir, could wait for ten more years

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,080
till New Youth reaches

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,200
its Issue 24,

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,640
to discuss it with me. 

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,080
Otherwise, I will offer you these 8 words:

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
neither learned nor skilled, a incorrigibly obstinate trouble-maker

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,520
as the caption of your life

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,840
and the epitaph 

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,160
of your death.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:34,400
Caption of life, epitaph of death!

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,560
Bravo!

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,160
This is the end of our performance.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
Dear teachers, what do you think?

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,960
How was our performance?

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
Alright,

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
let's quiet down first.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,840
We'll take turns to share our comments.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,200
Mrs. Chen,

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm aware that you're a respected commentator on “living newspapers"

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
from Female Higher Normal College.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,920
Would you mind offering our students some feedback?

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,360
Each age bring forth new genius on this noble land,

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,120
each will rule its own domain for years to come.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,720
The younger generation nowadays

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,800
are much more competent than my generation. 

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,640
Say for example, 

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,320
the interactions they presented between the stage and the wings,

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
were so creative and lively.

31
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,840
Such a wonderful performance, which

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
leaves me with no room to make suggestions.

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
Great!

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
These are indeed words from an expert.

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Mrs. Hu, would you care to say something?

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
I'll just skip this part...

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
Just say something,

38
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,320
 anything.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920
Even a fair lady like you...

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
has the courage to perform on stage...

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
Dear teachers, 

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
Our students are thinking about taking their performance

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
to the University and onto the streets.

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
What do you guys think about that?

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,120
I think they did such a terrific job that also 

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
elevated our publications on New Youth.

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
If the performance becomes public,

48
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,760
it's definitely going to be a hit!

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,880
Congratulations!

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,440
Awesome!

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,600
Chancellor Cai, do you have anything to add?

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Your performance

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,760
is extraordinary!

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,760
Great!

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
I feel so delighted seeing this.

56
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
With these many talented youths,

57
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,280
we have no reason to worry about 

58
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
the future of New Culture Movement.

59
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,400
Although this "living newspaper" is not 

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,360
as exquisite as the Western operas,

61
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,800
nor is it as extravagant.

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
It's nonetheless very practical,

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,760
and carries a huge artistic appeal.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
It can definitely inspire other people.

65
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,120
Specially your disguise as a male,

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
I've seen similar actings when I was studying in Germany.

67
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,920
Good job!

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
Now that you want to take it outside of campus

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
promoting such performances 

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
to the society at large,

71
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,480
and  to the general public,

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
you have my full support!

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
Hurray!

74
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,600
Hurray!

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
Jinnuan, hurry up, the Master is here.

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,440
Laoliu,

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
Master, it's been a while.

78
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
Here I am.

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
Jinnuan was waiting for so long and getting impatient.

80
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Master,

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
you're finally here!

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,520
The nutritious paste is already prepared for you.

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,640
Jinnuan,

84
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,280
go ahead to the west chamber and play Mah-jong with Laoliu first,

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
I have something to discuss with my nephew in your room.

86
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,040
What is it that you have to keep away from me?

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
If you win, you keep the money, otherwise, I'll cover the amount you lost.

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,720
Just go ahead.

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,400
Go.

90
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,920
Let's go.

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
Second Uncle, what happened exactly?

92
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,120
You remained silent this entire way here.

93
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,240
Master Lin is furious.

94
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,000
He insisted on barging into the Presidential Palace

95
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
to sue Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei.

96
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,480
I managed to stop him.

97
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Second uncle, I really don't get it,

98
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
why are you risking everything to lick the boots of this Lin Shu guy.

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
He's just a pedantic scholar, what's the use of him?

100
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
You're clueless!

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,240
He is a facade.

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
With the halo over us

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,640
from this Clear Stream leader,

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
we can easily get things done.

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,000
In that case,

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
what shall we do now.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
Our urgent priority now

108
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
is to stop the kids

109
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,120
from continuing their living newspaper performances.

110
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,720
Their influence is detrimental.

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,760
They're basically targeting Lin Shu.

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
The old man cannot take it anymore.

113
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,480
But... how can we stop them?

114
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,720
Unless the government steps in.

115
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
Both Lin Shu and I respectively called the 

116
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Chief Police Inspector Wu Bingxiang,

117
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,320
demanding the banning of public living newspaper plays.

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
I complained about them inciting the masses to disturb public order.

119
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
Wu Bingxiang had agreed to intervene,

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,760
instructing the Qianmen Polica Station to deal with this matter.

121
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,720
He advised that I contact Commissioner Wei directly.

122
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
But it's not appropriate for me to meet with him in person. You have to go.

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,960
Me?

124
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,480
What should I say to him?

125
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Use this to talk to him.

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
Go find some people to work with the police,

127
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
try to cause as much of a scene as you can.

128
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
Better yet, cause some fights and the students arrested.

129
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,760
Make it ugly!

130
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm good at this.

131
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Also, use your identity as a reporter

132
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
to get people to write and publish something

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,040
explicitly targeting Chen Du Xiu and Cai Yuanpei,

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
especially Chen Duxiu.

135
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
Fabricate public opinion to sully his reputation.

136
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
At the same time, set up more enemies for him

137
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,520
inside of Peking University.

138
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,960
Right,

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,480
Wasn't it the case that your teacher Huang Kan

140
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,040
was to start a journal at Peking University

141
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
to challenge New Youth?

142
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
Hurry up and get it going.

143
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,520
Stop being so sluggish.

144
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,240
 Your nephew understand.

145
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,760
Remember, any fortresses would be easiest to conquer from the inside.

146
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,320
You people are departing from the classics and rebelling against orthodoxy.

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
How dare you use vernacular writings to replace classical Chinese?

148
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
Our Classical Chinese differentiates between parallel prose and common prose,

149
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,080
as they each have their own beauties. 

150
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,880
The writings following the Wen Xuan style are suitable for expressing one's emotions.

151
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,200
The writings in Tong Cheng style are best for expositions.

152
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
For those who devoted learners, they may benefit from classical Chinese all their lives.

153
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,200
How can western vernacular poetry and classical Chinese be mentioned in the same breath?

154
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,280
Our journal encourages vernacular writings

155
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
and opposes degenerated and outdated literature. 

156
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
We have already exposed 

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
their very sickness.

158
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,920
Outdated literature has

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
no grandeur nor elegance.

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
Much like a prettifying 

161
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
coquettish strumpet,

162
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
Outdated Chinese can no longer enter

163
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
the hall of fame of modern China.

164
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,840
The vernacular writings we're trying to promote are

165
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
concise and accessible, straightforward and effective,

166
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
which appeal to both refined and popular tastes, thus are efficient and practical.

167
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,000
Unlike certain writings in classical Chinese,

168
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
which always start with paragraphs of cliche, 

169
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
cumbersome, humming and hawing，

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
"still holding the lute with half hidden face". 
(referring to the affected and obscure style of writing)

171
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
New Culture my foot!

172
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,920
A chick on stage... pathetic!

173
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,800
What did you say?

174
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,080
Say that again?!

175
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
I was just talking about the people on stage, thank you.

176
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,280
Follow me!

177
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,240
Come on.

178
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,040
What's going on here?

179
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,760
You're having illegal performance

180
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,400
inciting the crowd to make trouble,

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
disturbing public safety and blocking traffic.

182
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm under orders to ban your performance.

183
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
We're students from Peking University.

184
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,720
We're just here to promote new ideologies and new culture.

185
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,680
What's wrong with that?

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
I know you're all college students,

187
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,800
but not all from Peking University.

188
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,160
Which ones of you are Deng Zhongxia, Zhao Shiyan,

189
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
Chen Yannian and Liu Mei?

190
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,160
Step out.

191
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
-I am, what to you want?
- I am.

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
You four are the culprits.

193
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
You must come with me to the police station right away.

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
The others are to be escorted back to campus

195
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,320
so that they can be disciplined by the school.

196
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Take them.

197
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,000
Move along.

198
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,560
What are you doing?

199
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,160
Don't touch us!

200
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,680
Let's calm down, fellow classmates.

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
Let's not have any conflict with the police.

202
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,680
Listen to me!

203
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,480
Now that this is happening,

204
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
let's just follow the orders of the police.

205
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,360
Classmates,

206
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
please take our stage settings and props

207
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,760
and return safely to campus.

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,280
We four are willing to go with you,

209
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,320
but, don't start a fight.

210
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
Move!

211
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,680
Grab them!

212
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,800
Come on.

213
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,320
What are you doing?

214
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,440
Don't drag us.

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
Don't move.

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
You people are so unreasonable!

217
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,640
Yannian, you guys watch yourselves!

218
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,440
Don't worry.

219
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,080
Walking around the street with this doggerel:

220
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
Fair maiden pretends to be an old codger, 

221
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
who knows whom had offended whom?

222
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,760
All got taken away and no explanation allowed.

223
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Get lost!

224
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,920
Even though you have intimidating stiff neck glaring eyes, 

225
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
you're at best a dog let out by your master.

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,520
Move!

227
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,240
Shut up!

228
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,560
Brother Botang, although you're the acting premier, 

229
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
you're still the premier of state affairs.

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
You have to be accountable for Peking University!

231
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,800
Chancellor Cai, please be at rest.

232
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
I have already sent my men to the police bureau to investigate the matter.

233
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
They said among the people arrested 

234
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
only one was from Peking University.

235
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
They arrested four of our students,

236
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
the other three are from the French continuing education class.

237
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
They are my students as well!

238
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
It was Peking University's plan to 

239
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,040
have the students go on the street to perform living newspaper.

240
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
As the chancellor of Peking University,

241
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm naturally overseeing and endorsing the events.

242
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,160
How can they say that this has nothing to do with Peking University?

243
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,440
I understand,

244
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,360
I have already issued instructions to have them be released.

245
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,280
It's just that I cannot get hold of Wu Bingxiang at the moment.

246
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
I'll keep looking for him.

247
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,000
You have to keep Peking University under control there.

248
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
Try not to escalate things.

249
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll be honest with you,

250
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,040
right now, my office 

251
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,520
is packed with our students.

252
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
So please urge Wu Bingxiang

253
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,840
to release our students immediately,

254
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,400
otherwise, the consequences would be beyond his control.

255
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,640
Please have him found right away,

256
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,240
I'll just be here waiting for your call back.

257
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,440
Alright.

258
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,480
How's the situation now, Chancellor?

259
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,280
As for now, they are

260
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,960
negotiating with the police bureau

261
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
demanding the students to be released immediately.

262
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,280
But the thing is, they couldn't find Wu Bingxiang.

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
He's the chief inspector of the bureau.

264
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,680
Without his approval, the students won't be released.

265
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
So I was told to wait for further updates.

266
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,760
The phone is ringing!

267
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
This is Cai Yuanpei.

268
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
Oh, wow, our chief inspector 

269
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,760
is finally here.

270
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,600
Alright, you go ahead.

271
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,640
Go on.

272
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,840
Excuse me?

273
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,280
You want me to go to the police bureau in person?

274
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,600
The circumstance is rather complicated?

275
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,680
You have to follow given procedures?

276
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
But you didn't follow any procedures when you arrested our students.

277
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,280
Now you are observing the procedures when it comes releasing them?

278
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
Alright then, I can pay you a visit

279
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
but only under one condition:

280
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
you have to let the students go right away.

281
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,360
This is my only requirement and condition.

282
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
No, no need for your car.

283
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
I'll be there myself.

284
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
They have already agreed to release the students.

285
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,320
As for now, 

286
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,680
they need some sort guarantor procedure to be fulfilled.

287
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,800
What guarantor?

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
Did our students violate any laws?

289
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,800
It's probably some legal protocol. 

290
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
I couldn't tell either.

291
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
And they requested Zhongfu's attendance as well.

292
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,600
Why is that?

293
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,080
I couldn't figure out exactly from the phone call.

294
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
The thing is Zhongfu and I have to go to the bureau right now.

295
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,440
Having the students released is our topmost priority.

296
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,040
Chancellor Cai, I'll go with you.

297
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
After all the performance of living newspaper was based on my proposal.

298
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,120
Shiyan, you're quite strong!

299
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:08,960
Come on.

300
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,760
Keep on going.

301
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
Shiyan, defeat him!

302
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,520
Come again.

303
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
Switch to the other leg.

304
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,680
Come on.

305
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
Watch me.

306
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,280
All stand up!

307
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,680
Stand up!

308
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,040
I AM standing.

309
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,240
Who asked you to stand upside down? Get down here.

310
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
I don't care about who you are.

311
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
As long as you're here, you have to obey our rules.

312
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,600
Don't seek troubles for yourselves?

313
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,040
Clear?

314
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,400
Clear!

315
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
There's orders from the top: treat them nicely.

316
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,320
Our chief asked us to give you guys preferential treatment.

317
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,240
You can make one demand.

318
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,800
Sir, we demand to 

319
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,560
be released!

320
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,280
Nonsense!

321
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,640
Why would we keep you here if we can release you?

322
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,760
Sir, in that case,

323
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
please take some books for us to read.

324
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,960
How about I get you some copies of the almanac?

325
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
You're the one who just said we can make a demand.

326
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,840
What kind of books then?

327
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,800
Any kind of books,

328
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
but preferably ones translated from foreign languages.

329
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
You're picky one...

330
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,800
you're demanding books with letters.

331
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,080
Just wait here.

332
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,080
Sir,

333
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,520
we also demand some water.

334
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,800
Sir,

335
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,920
four towels please.

336
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,720
Sir,

337
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,760
a bar of soap as well.

338
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
Sir, toothpaste too.

339
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
How about some crudités paired with wine?

340
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
Sir, we wouldn't say no to that!

341
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,560
Wait for me to slap your face!

342
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,520
Take it easy!

343
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,960
They asked us not to beat them.

344
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,240
Come on.

345
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,800
Thank you!

346
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
Don't worry,

347
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,680
I've been imprisoned before.

348
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,040
It's actually much nicer here than outside.

349
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
They won't harm us.

350
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
I'm not scared at all, 

351
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,120
rather it's a lot fun here!

352
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,400
I feel the same.

353
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,400
As long as I have books to read, it's a holiday anywhere I am.

354
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
No wonder they call you the "dusk thief"!
(seizing the last sunlight to read)

355
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,840
I was just about to comfort you folks.

356
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
But now it seems

357
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
we all have the spirit to seek joy amidst sorrow!

358
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,800
We'll just put our minds at ease

359
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
and make it home here.

360
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,400
Let's see how they're going to ask us to leave later.

361
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,080
Hang in there, fellow classmates!

362
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Hang in there!

363
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Hang in there!

364
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,600
Hang in there!
