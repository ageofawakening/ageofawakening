00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,080

7
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,640
come have a chat with me again.

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,080
If not, I shall have to gift you the following eight words:

[Chen Yannian, Eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,520
as the caption of your life

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,840
and the epitaph

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,160
of your death.

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:34,400
Caption of life, epitaph of death!

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,560
Bravo!

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,160
This is the end of our performance.

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
Dear teachers, what do you think?

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,960
How was our performance?

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
Alright,

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
let's quiet down first.

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,840
We'll take turns to share our comments.

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,200
Mrs. Chen,

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm aware that you're a respected commentator on â€œliving newspapers"

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
from Female Higher Normal College.

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,920
Would you mind offering our students some feedback?

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,360
Each age bring forth new genius on this noble land,

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,120
each will rule its own domain for years to come.

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,720
The younger generation nowadays

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,800
are much more competent than my generation.

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,640
Say for example,

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,320
the interactions they presented between the stage and the wings,

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
were so creative and lively.

34
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,840
Such a wonderful performance, which

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
leaves me with no room to make suggestions.

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
Great!

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
These are indeed words from an expert.

38
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Mrs. Hu, would you care to say something?

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
I'll just skip this part...

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
Just say something,

41
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,320
anything.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920
Even a fair lady like you...

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
has the courage to perform on stage...

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
Dear teachers,

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
Our students are thinking about taking their performance

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
to the University and onto the streets.

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
What do you guys think about that?

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,120
I think they did such a terrific job that also

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
elevated our publications on New Youth.

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
If the performance becomes public,

51
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,760
it's definitely going to be a hit!

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,880
Congratulations!

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,440
Awesome!

54
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,600
Mr. Cai, do you have anything to add?

55
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Your performance

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,760
is extraordinary!

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,760
Great!

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
I feel so delighted seeing this.

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
With these many talented youths,

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,280
we have no reason to worry about

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
the future of New Culture Movement.

62
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,400
Although this "living newspaper" is not

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,360
as exquisite as the Western operas,

64
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,800
nor is it as extravagant.

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
It's nonetheless very practical,

66
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,760
and carries a huge artistic appeal.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
It can definitely inspire other people.

68
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,120
Specially your disguise as a male,

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
I've seen similar actings when I was studying in Germany.

70
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,920
Good job!

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
Now that you want to take it outside of campus

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
promoting such performances

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
to the society at large,

74
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,480
and to the general public,

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
you have my full support!

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
Hurray!

77
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,600
Hurray!

78
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
Jinnuan, hurry up, the Master is here.

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,440
Laoliu,

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
Master, it's been a while.

81
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
Here I am.

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
Jinnuan was waiting for so long and getting impatient.

83
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Master,

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
you're finally here!

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,520
The nutritious paste is already prepared for you.

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,640
Jinnuan,

87
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,280
go ahead to the west chamber and play Mah-jong with Laoliu first,

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
I have something to discuss with my nephew in your room.

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,040
What is it that you have to keep away from me?

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
If you win, you keep the money, otherwise, I'll cover the amount you lost.

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,720
Just go ahead.

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,400
Go.

93
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,920
Let's go.

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
Second uncle, what happened exactly?

95
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,120
You remained silent this entire way here.

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,240
Master Lin is furious.

97
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,000
He insisted on barging into the Presidential Palace

98
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
to sue Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei.

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,480
I managed to stop him.

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Second uncle, I really don't get it,

101
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
why are you risking everything to lick the boots of this Lin Shu guy.

102
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
He's just a pedantic scholar, what's the use of him?

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
You're clueless!

104
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,240
He is a facade.

105
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
With the halo over us

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,640
from this Clear Stream leader,

107
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
we can easily get things done.

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,000
In that case,

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
what shall we do now?

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
Our urgent priority now

111
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
is to stop those kids

112
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,120
from continuing their living newspaper performances.

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,720
Their influence is detrimental.

114
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,760
They're basically targeting Lin Shu.

115
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
The old man cannot take it anymore.

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,480
But... how can we stop them?

117
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,720
Unless the government steps in.

118
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
Both Lin Shu and I respectively called the

119
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Chief Police Inspector Wu Bingxiang,

120
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,320
demanding the banning of public living newspaper plays.

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
I complained about them inciting the masses to disturb public order.

122
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
Wu Bingxiang had agreed to intervene,

123
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,760
instructing the Qianmen Police Station to deal with this matter.

124
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,720
He advised that I contact Commissioner Wei directly.

125
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
But it's not appropriate for me to meet with him in person. You have to go.

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,960
Me?

127
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,480
What should I say to him?

128
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Use this to talk to him.

129
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
Go find some people to work with the police,

130
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
try to cause as much of a scene as you can.

131
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
Better yet, cause some fights and the students arrested.

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,760
Make it ugly!

133
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm good at this.

134
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Also, use your identity as a reporter

135
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
to get people to write and publish something

136
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,040
explicitly targeting Chen Du Xiu and Cai Yuanpei,

137
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
especially Chen Duxiu.

138
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
Fabricate public opinion to sully his reputation.

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
At the same time, set up more enemies for him

140
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,520
inside of Peking University.

141
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,960
Right.

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,480
Wasn't it the case that your teacher Huang Kan

143
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,040
was to start a journal at Peking University

144
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
to challenge New Youth?

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
Hurry up and get it going.

146
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,520
Stop being so sluggish.

147
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,240
I understand.

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,760
Remember, any fortresses would be easiest to conquer from the inside.

149
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,320
You people are departing from the classics and rebelling against orthodoxy.

150
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
How dare you use vernacular writings to replace classical Chinese?

151
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
Our Classical Chinese differentiates between parallel prose and common prose,

152
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,080
as they each have their own beauties.

153
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,880
Writings in Wen Xuan style are best for expressing emotions.

154
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,200
Writings in Tong Cheng style are best for expositions.

155
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
For those devoted learners, they may benefit from classical Chinese all their lives.

156
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,200
How can Western vernacular poetry and Classical Chinese be mentioned in the same breath?

157
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,280
Our journal encourages vernacular writings

158
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
and opposes degenerated and outdated literature.

159
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
We have already exposed

160
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
their very sickness.

161
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,920
Outdated literature has

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
no grandeur nor elegance.

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
Much like a prettifying

164
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
coquettish strumpet,

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
outdated Chinese can no longer enter

166
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
the hall of fame of modern China.

167
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,840
The vernacular writings we're trying to promote are

168
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
concise and accessible, straightforward and effective,

169
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
which appeal to both refined and popular tastes, thus are efficient and practical.

170
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,000
Unlike certain writings in classical Chinese,

171
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
which always start with paragraphs of cliche,

172
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
cumbersome, humming and hawingï¼Œ

173
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
"still holding the lute with half hidden face".
(referring to the affected and obscure style of writing)

174
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
New Culture my foot!

175
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,920
A chick on stage... pathetic!

176
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,800
What did you say?

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,080
Say that again?!

178
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
I was just talking about the people on stage, thank you.

179
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,280
Follow me!

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,240
Let's go!

181
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,040
What's going on here?

182
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,760
You're holding an illegal performance,

183
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,400
inciting the crowd to make trouble,

184
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
disturbing public safety and blocking traffic.

185
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm under orders to ban your performance.

186
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
We're students from Peking University.

187
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,720
We're just here to promote new ideologies and new culture.

188
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,680
What's wrong with that?

189
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
I know you're all college students,

190
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,800
but not all from Peking University.

191
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,160
Which ones of you are Deng Zhongxia, Zhao Shiyan,

192
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
Chen Yannian and Liu Mei?

193
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,160
Step out.

194
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
- I am, what to you want?
- I am.

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
You four are the culprits.

196
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
You must come with me to the police station right away.

197
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
The others are to be escorted back to campus

198
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,320
so that they can be disciplined by the school.

199
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Take them!

200
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,000
Move!

201
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,560
What are you doing?

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,160
Don't touch us!

203
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,680
Let's calm down, fellow classmates.

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
Let's not have any conflict with the police.

205
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,680
Listen to me!

206
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,480
Now that this is happening,

207
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
let's just follow the orders of the police.

208
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,360
Classmates,

209
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
please take our stage settings and props

210
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:13,918
[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

211
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,760
and return safely to campus.

212
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,280
We four are willing to go with you,

213
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,320
but, don't start a fight.

214
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
Move!

215
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,680
Grab them!

216
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,800
Come on.

217
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,320
What are you doing?

218
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,440
Don't drag us!

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
Don't move!

220
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
You people are so unreasonable!

221
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,640
Yannian, you guys watch yourselves!

222
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,440
Don't worry!

223
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,080
Walking around the street with this doggerel:

224
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
Fair maiden pretends to be an old codger,

225
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
who knows whom had offended whom?

226
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,760
All got taken away and no explanation allowed.

227
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Get lost!

228
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,920
Even though you have intimidating stiff neck glaring eyes,

229
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
you're at best a dog let out by your master.

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,520
Move!

231
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,240
Shut up!

232
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,560
Brother Botang, although you're the acting Premier,

233
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
you're still the Premier of the State Council.

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
You have to be accountable for Peking University!

235
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,800
Chancellor Cai, please be at rest.

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
I have already sent my men to the police bureau to investigate the matter.

237
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
They said among the people arrested

238
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
only one was from Peking University.

239
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
They arrested four of our students,

240
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
the other three are from the French continuing education class.

241
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
They are my students as well!

242
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
It was Peking University's plan to

243
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,040
have the students go on the street to perform living newspaper.

244
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
As the President of Peking University,

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm naturally overseeing and endorsing the events.

246
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,160
How can they say that this has nothing to do with Peking University?

247
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,440
I understand,

248
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,032
[Wang Daxie, styled Botang, Acting Premier of the State Council]

249
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,360
I have already issued instructions to have them be released.

250
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,280
It's just that I cannot get hold of Wu Bingxiang at the moment.

251
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
I'll keep looking for him.

252
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,000
You have to keep Peking University under control there.

253
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
Try not to escalate things.

254
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll be honest with you,

255
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,040
right now, my office

256
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,520
is packed with our students.

257
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
So please urge Wu Bingxiang

258
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,840
to release our students immediately,

259
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,400
otherwise, the consequences would be beyond his control.

260
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,640
Please have him found right away,

261
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,240
I'll just be here waiting for your call back.

262
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,440
Alright.

263
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,480
How's the situation now, Mr. Cai?

264
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,280
As for now, they are

265
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,960
negotiating with the police bureau

266
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
demanding the students to be released immediately.

267
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,280
But the thing is, they couldn't find Wu Bingxiang.

268
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
He's the chief inspector of the bureau.

269
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,680
Without his approval, the students won't be released.

270
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
So I was told to wait for further updates.

271
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,760
The phone is ringing!

272
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
This is Cai Yuanpei.

273
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
Oh, wow, our chief inspector

274
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,760
is finally here.

275
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,600
Alright, you go ahead.

276
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,640
Go on.

277
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,840
Excuse me?

278
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,280
You want me to go to the police bureau in person?

279
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,600
The circumstance is rather complicated?

280
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,680
You have to follow given procedures?

281
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
But you didn't follow any procedures when you arrested our students.

282
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,280
Now you are observing the procedures when it comes releasing them?

283
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
Alright then, I can pay you a visit

284
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
but only under one condition:

285
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
you have to let the students go right away.

286
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,360
This is my only requirement and condition.

287
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
No, no need for your car.

288
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
I'll be there myself.

289
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
They have already agreed to release the students.

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,320
As for now,

291
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,680
they need some sort guarantor procedure to be fulfilled.

292
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,800
What guarantor?

293
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
Did our students violate any laws?

294
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,800
It's probably some legal protocol.

295
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
I couldn't tell either.

296
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
And they requested Zhongfu's attendance as well.

297
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,600
Why is that?

298
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,080
I couldn't figure out exactly from the phone call.

299
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
The thing is Zhongfu and I have to go to the bureau right now.

300
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,440
Having the students released is our topmost priority.

301
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,040
Mr. Cai, I'll go with you.

302
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
After all the performance of living newspaper was based on my proposal.

303
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,120
Shiyan, you're quite strong!

304
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:08,960
Come on.

305
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,760
Keep on going.

306
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
Shiyan, defeat him!

307
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,520
Come again.

308
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
Switch to the other leg.

309
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,680
Come on.

310
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
Watch me.

311
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,280
All stand up!

312
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,680
Stand up!

313
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,040
I AM standing.

314
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,240
Who asked you to stand upside down? Get down here.

315
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
I don't care about who you are.

316
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
As long as you're here, you have to obey our rules.

317
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,600
Don't seek troubles for yourselves?

318
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,040
Clear?

319
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,400
Clear!

320
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
There's orders from the top: treat them nicely.

321
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,320
Our chief asked us to give you guys preferential treatment.

322
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,240
You can make one demand.

323
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,800
Sir, we demand to

324
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,560
be released!

325
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,280
Nonsense!

326
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,640
Why would we keep you here if we can release you?

327
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,760
Sir, in that case,

328
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:07,356
[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

329
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
please take some books for us to read.

330
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,960
How about I get you some copies of the almanac?

331
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
You're the one who just said we can make a demand.

332
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,840
What kind of books then?

333
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,800
Any kind of books,

334
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
but preferably ones translated from foreign languages.

335
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
You're picky one...

336
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,800
you're demanding books with letters.

337
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,080
Just wait here.

338
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,080
Sir,

339
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,520
we also demand some water.

340
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,800
Sir,

341
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,920
four towels please.

342
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,720
Sir,

343
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,760
a bar of soap as well.

344
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
Sir, toothpaste too.

345
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
How about some cruditÃ©s paired with wine?

346
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
Sir, we wouldn't say no to that!

347
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,560
Wait for me to slap your face!

348
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,520
Take it easy!

349
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,960
They asked us not to beat them.

350
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,240
Come on.

351
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,800
Thank you!

352
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
Don't worry,

353
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,680
I've been imprisoned before.

354
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,040
It's actually much nicer here than outside.

355
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
They won't harm us.

356
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
I'm not scared at all,

357
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,120
rather it's a lot fun here!

358
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,400
I feel the same.

359
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,400
As long as I have books to read, it's a holiday anywhere I am.

360
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
No wonder they call you the "dusk thief"!
(seizing the last sunlight to read)

361
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,840
I was just about to comfort you folks.

362
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
But now it seems

363
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
we all have the spirit to seek joy amidst sorrow!

364
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,800
We'll just put our minds at ease

365
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
and make it home here.

366
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,400
Let's see how they're going to ask us to leave later.

367
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,080
Hang in there, fellow classmates!

368
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Hang in there!

369
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Hang in there!

370
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,600
Hang in there!

371
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,077
[Wu Bingxiang, Capital Police Chief Inspector]

372
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,280
After you.

373
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,600
Salute!

374
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,280
Principal Cai

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
has invited all the great sages to meet here.

376
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,240
It's really unexpected.

377
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,400
However, these are the regulations,

378
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
and I have no choice but to carry them out.

379
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,280
I hope you can understand.

380
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,840
Chief Inspector Wu is very kind.

381
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,720
I resent being a little abrupt.

382
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,640
I also don't know what regulation

383
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,480
states that you, Chief Inspector Wu,

384
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,920
have to attack and imprison

385
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
my students for no reason.

386
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,400
Principal Cai, you misunderstand.

387
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Salute!

388
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
You make me more courageous.

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
I dare not offend you.

390
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
Principal Cai's majesty.

391
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
Please, please.

392
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,800
Please.

393
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,240
Please have a seat.

394
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,440
Mr. Cai does not know,

395
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,800
that in the past month,

396
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,640
the Capital Police has received all kinds of reports

397
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,680
accusing Peking University's Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei

398
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
of advocating falsehoods, slandering the sages,

399
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,480
spreading wickedness to deceive people, and violating rights.

400
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
At the same time, they are still worried about advocating students

401
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
to perform illegal performances to disturb the peace,

402
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,040
and asking the police to crack down on them.

403
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,640
Excuse me, Chief Inspector Wu,

404
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,080
what you just said

405
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,240
is an accusation against both of us.

406
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,360
Then why don't the police arrest me?

407
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,640
Why do you want to arrest

408
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,640
and attack my students?

409
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,640
That accent sounds like it's from my hometown.

410
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,840
I have an accent?

411
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,120
No, no, no.

412
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,000
This must be the famous

413
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,120
New Culture leader, Professor Chen Duxiu.

414
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,360
Good question, fellow countryman.

415
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Why don't I arrest you?

416
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
Honestly, it's not that I dare not.

417
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
I haven't found

418
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,640
any direct evidence that you broke the law.

419
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
Similarly,

420
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
I took in four of your classmates,

421
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,120
but they did break the law.

422
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,080
If I may ask, Chief Inspector Wu,

423
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,960
the students were performing in the streets to publicize new ideas,

424
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,240
what were their crimes?

425
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,120
Another fellow countryman.

426
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,800
Hu Shi, Dr. Hu.

427
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
Okay, I'll answer you.

428
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,120
What law did they break?

429
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,240
This is from this afternoon at 2:30.

430
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,680
The Capital Police received three phone calls to report

431
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,920
that someone was performing illegally in downtown

432
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,600
to disturb the public order.

433
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,080
This one...

434
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
This is from 4:30 this afternoon.

435
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,040
The report of Qianmen Police Station

436
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,400
about arresting

437
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,560
four students, including Deng Zhongxia.

438
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
The motive for the arrest

439
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,840
was that they agigated the public

440
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
to disturb the peace and fight in brawls.

441
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,880
You see, disturbing the peace again.

442
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,320
And these.

443
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
These are all evidence materials.

444
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,080
Chief Inspector Wu.

445
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
There is no need to say more.

446
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,560
Now we just want to know

447
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,080
where the four students are and how they are.

448
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,680
Shouchang, Mr. Li Dazhao.

449
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
Sir, you can rest assured,

450
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,120
the four students

451
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680
are now studying in the ward

452
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
and all of them are safe and sound.

453
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,760
Chief Inspector Wu, we're here to collect our people.

454
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,200
It's getting late now.

455
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,960
All our teachers and students

456
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,000
are waiting for the news that we are going back to school.

457
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,280
Principal Cai should not be too hasty.

458
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,960
As I said on the phone,

459
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,160
you can let your people go through the procedures.

460
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,520
What procedures?

461
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,680
The first thing I want to tell you

462
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,560
is that these students really broke the law

463
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
and should be severely punished according to the law.

464
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
However, due to various reasons,

465
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,400
we are lenient and can release them on bail,

466
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,280
to the school and parents

467
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
to discpline them themselves.

468
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,360
This is the bail contract.

469
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,560
I hope that both of you can fill in this form carefully

470
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,480
and bear the corresponding legal responsibilities.

471
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,520
What if we don't sign this?

472
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
Then I will follow the procedures.

473
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,400
Okay, okay.

474
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,560
It is important that we take care of our people.

475
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,040
I'll fill out this bail contract.

476
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,760
Brother Zhongfu.

477
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,280
There is another reason why I wanted to invite you

478
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,120
to the police department.

479
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720
You've got a record in the police department.

480
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,640
I hope you'll take care of yourself

481
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
and don't go your own way.

482
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,480
This is a kind reminder

483
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
from a fellow countryman.

484
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Then I'll thank you for being a fellow countryman.

485
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,840
A kind reminder.

486
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,800
Mr. Cai, to be fair,

487
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,640
all the students you have taught

488
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,640
are great talents.

489
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,320
Open it.

490
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,920
Students, we're here to pick you up.

491
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,120
Sir, you've come!

492
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,640
Don't worry.

493
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't worry, quick, Mr. Cai's here.

494
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,320
Mr. Cai.

495
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,040
Sir.

496
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,520
Mr. Cai.

497
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Don't worry, sir, we are unscathed.

498
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,360
So stupid that they can't even fight.

499
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,520
Don't be nervous, sir.

500
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,920
It's nothing more than a fight and getting into a classroom.

501
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,840
Maybe you'll have to come in

502
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,360
and stay at intervals in the future.

503
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,360
It's good to get used to it early.

504
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,440
Dean Chen is just joking with you.

505
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,120
Come, let's leave.

506
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,714
Let's go.

507
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,993
It's really nothing.

508
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:38,524
It's nothing.

509
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,280
Let's go.

510
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,440
That's my book.

511
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,197
[New Youth Editorial Board]

512
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,480
Tilt it, tilt it.

513
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,600
Yannian, don't move.

514
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,880
You've just come out and you're still in poor health.

515
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,320
Aunt, it's fine.

516
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,120
It's quite serious.

517
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,880
Don't move when I tell you to.

518
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,360
Sit quickly.

519
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,240
Today must be celebrated.

520
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,600
Drink some wine.

521
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,520
Why do you celebrate when you're not happy?

522
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,400
Celebrate Chen Yannian's imprisonment today.

523
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,360
If you want to celebrate, you should celebrate getting out of jail.

524
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
You're celebrating getting into prison.

525
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,360
In these turbulent times,

526
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
if you want to seek truth and stick to your faith,

527
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,840
things like today

528
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,120
may be the norm.

529
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
So you should always be ready

530
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,000
to go to prison and get out of prison.

531
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,160
Into prison, then out of prison.

532
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,720
Into prison, then out of prison.

533
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
I've already prepared for this.

534
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,600
Okay, let's have a drink.

535
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,320
I have the six "No"s,

536
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,280
I can't drink.

537
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,240
Yes,

538
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
a gentleman must keep his word, and his deeds must be carried out.

539
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,640
I respect you.

540
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,480
You don't have to break the rules.

541
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,760
Today, I will to break the rules.

542
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,120
Break what rule?

543
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
I want to break the 20-year rule of not talking about politics.

544
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,440
From this day onwards,

545
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,200
I, Chen Duxiu, will start talking about politics again.

546
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
Are you crazy? What politics are you talking about?

547
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,880
Not crazy.

548
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,120
It's cocoon shedding.

549
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
It's reinvigoration.

550
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,480
I've been foolish for several years,

and Chen Duxiu has come back.

552
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
How are you going to talk about politics?

553
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,560
Now, you still believe in anarchism.

554
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,600
Correct.

555
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,120
Alright.

556
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,800
To be honest, I also appreciate the theory of mutual aid.

557
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,560
But I don't think

558
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,560
we can be limited to one theory,

559
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,600
so I hope you will have the opportunity

560
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,920
to experiment in the future.

561
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,600
Experiment?

562
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,960
Experiment.

563
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,640
Experiment?

564
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,440
Yes.

565
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,320
Besides, you should know how to compare and identify.

566
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,240
What you mean compare?

567
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
Have you studied the Russian October Revolution

568
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,960
that just happened last year?

569
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,240
I'm not interested in violent revolution.

570
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,160
You are not interested

571
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,000
because you don't know it at all.

572
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm telling you. The October Revolution

573
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,160
established a socialist system of public ownership

574
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,320
of the means of production that deprived the dispossessed.

575
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,520
Public ownership doesn't interest you?

576
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,720
Public ownership interests me.

577
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,840
I study public ownership.

578
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,480
The public ownership you studied before is in books.

579
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,000
Now there are living, breathing entities.

580
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,200
What makes you refuse?

581
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
That doesn't make sense.

582
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,760
So you have to research

583
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,120
and be interested.

584
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,880
Why do I have to do what I'm not interested in?

585
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,920
How can this celebration be so low-tempered?

586
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,720
I'm not low-tempered.

587
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360

Hello.

What book are you reading?

643
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
I just borrowed it from your library.

So I thought, read it all at once.

So

652
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,080
you are also a believer in anarchism?

653
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,600
Believer?

654
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,880
Not really.

655
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,240
But I've always had an interest

656
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,040
in anarchism,

657
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
especially Krupotkin's mutual aid theory.

658
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,480
Coincidence!

659
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,480
We both believe in the theory of mutual aid.

660
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
So the three of us are comrades?

661
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,360
Comrade?

662
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,680
I guess so.

Sit down.

Let me tell you something.

680
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
Since the three of us are already comrades,

681
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,160
we can't be polite.

682
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,720

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,520
Take this.

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,480
We'll eat with you.

685
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,560
Okay.

686
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,640
It's better to be respectful than obedient.

To be honest,

688
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,360

and found you a job in Peking University

740
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,280
that will not disrupt lectures,

741
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,880
but will allow you to earn money for food and clothing.

742
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,000
That's great.

743
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,960
Thank you.

744
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:39,920
I am preparing to

745
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
recommend you to Peking University's Red Building Library

746
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,320
to become Li Dazhou's assistant.

747
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,200
Are you alright with this?

748
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,680
Mr. Dazhou's assistant?

749
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,680
Alright.

750
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,480
I'm willing.

751
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,680
Thank you so much.

752
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,560
The pay is a little low.

753
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,000
Only eight dollars a month.

754
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,520
I don't mind.

755
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,320
I'm willing.

756
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,000
Then, let me see.

757
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,560
Alright.

758
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,560
I'll be on my way to find Mr. Shouchang.

759
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,240
I'll bring you to the Red Building.

760
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,120
Come, please.

761
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,600
Sir, please.

762
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,411
Please, you first.

763
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,600
Please, you first.

764
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,160
Here.

765
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,280
Right here.

766
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Still busy,

767
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,920
Mr. Shouchang?

768
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,720
Oh my, Mr. Cai.

769
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,240
Wait a bit for me.

770
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,880
Careful.

771
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,440
Alright.

772
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,680
Hello, Mr. Cai.

773
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,960
Isn't this a new batch of books for Peking University?

774
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,280
I've been busy unpacking.

775
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,560
So it's messy.

776
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,760
I see.

777
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,880
Indeed.

778
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,760
In this library,

779
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,560
I always see you working alone.

780
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,560
I got an assistant here for you.

781
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,520
Are you alright with it?

782
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Thank you for saving me.

783
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,560
That's good.

784
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,200
Let me formally introduce to both of you.

785
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
This is Peking University Library Director Li Dazhou,

786
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,800
Mr. Li Shouchang.

787
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,480
This is Hunan's

788
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,320
Mr. Mao Zedong, Mr. Mao Renzhi,

789
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,320
from Shaoshan, Hunan.

790
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,080
He's a member of the Xinmin Society

791
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,400
and Mr. Yang Changji's favorite student.

792
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,240
Mr. Dazhou.

793
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,640
I am from Hunan Provincial First Normal University.

794
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,000
Hello, Mr. Dazhao.

795
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:25,920
Hello.

796
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
He just graduated from that university.

797
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,520
His trip to Beijing

798
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,320
is to help out Hunan's French work-study program.

799
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,440
He's taking the opportunity

800
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,600
to come and learn from Peking University

801
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,160
to take a look.

802
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,840
So I decided to find him a job

803
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,760
to become your assistant.

804
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,560
What do you think?

805
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,560
Working in this library is hard work.

806
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,800
Are you ready for it?

807
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,240
Not a problem.

808
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,040
I'm not afraid of hard work.

809
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,440
If you have any work, just tell me.

810
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,480
That's good.

811
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,600
Good.

812
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,960
Runzhi,

813
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,120
if you have any difficulties,

814
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,480
please let me know.

815
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,440
Don't hold back.

816
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,200
Thank you, Mr. Cai.

817
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,480
Good.

818
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,760
I need to hurry for my seminar.

819
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,120
Please.

820
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,120
Take your time.

821
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,520
No hurry.

822
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,240
No worries.

823
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,640
I'll leave you to it.

824
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,280
Alright.

825
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,840
Mr. Dazhou,

826
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
let's get to work.

827
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,200
Look,

828
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,960
where shall we begin?

829
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,960
Good, good.

830
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,480
Let's do it.

831
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,680
Help me lift this box of books

832
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,880
and place them there.

833
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,600
Alrighty!

834
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,960
Mr. Dazhou,

835
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,080
it's this box right?

836
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:50,880
Yes.

837
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,440
Alright.

838
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:51,920
Good.

839
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,840
Runzhi,

840
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,560
right?

841
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,440
Yes.

842
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
Working in the library is hard work.

843
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,640
Sometimes we have to work overtime.

844
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,240
If you stay late you may just stay here for the night.

845
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,120
There's blankets there.

846
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,000
No need to worry.

847
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,560
Thank you.

848
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,520
No problem.

849
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,040
Do you enjoy reading?

850
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,400
I do!

851
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,520
I...

852
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,040
like to read every genre.

853
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,960
What books are you reading recently?

854
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,480
Recently,

855
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,280
I have enjoyed reading

856
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,560
books on anarchism.

857
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,360
In this case,

858
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,760
you're a follower of anarchism?

859
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,440
I won't call myself a follower,

860
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,800
I'm just interested

861
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,760
out of curiosity.

862
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,520
Runzhi,

863
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,280
pass me that book please.

864
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,160
Alright.

865
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,120
Here.

866
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,960
"The Communist Manifesto"

867
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Have you read it?

868
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
I've heard of it,

869
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,040
but I haven't read it.

870
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,760
Then,

871
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,840
how about the Russia's October Revolution?

872
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,080
I've heard about it as well,

873
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,360
but I'm not sure.

874
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,040
It's alright.

875
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,120
After today,

876
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,760
we will be clear on it.

877
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,040
This side's almost done.

878
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,440
Runzhi,

879
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,600
let's move this shelf over there.

880
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,080
Alright.

881
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,800
Be careful of the books on top.

882
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,600
Slowly.

883
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,560
Lift it up.

884
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,240
Give me a hand.

885
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,960
One, two, three.

886
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,520
Alright.

887
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,640
This way.

888
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,560
Peking University

889
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,000
has imported a new batch of books.

890
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,360
If you're willing,

891
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,160
I can give you the job

892
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,160
of editing the catalogue.

893
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,560
This way,

894
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,360
you'll be able to learn from your experience.

895
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,400
You will be the first to read those books.

896
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,360
Thank you so much!

897
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,640
Mr. Shouchang,

898
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,000
can I read them now?

899
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,720
Of course.

900
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,600
Come.

901
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,600
Let's go.

902
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,480
What did you say?

903
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm saying the incident of the police arresting students,

904
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,760
was a scheme planned by Zhang Fengzai,

905
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,120
a student of our school.

906
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,960
Sir, regarding such immoral students,

907
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,480
we should expel him immediately.

908
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,000
Do you have evidence?

909
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,200
I am the evidence.

910
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,960
I saw with my own eyes him speaking with the police.

911
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,400
It was he who asked the police to come.

912
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,000
Also that day we were performing,

913
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,440
there were people making a scene.

914
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,680
Those people were under the orders of Liu Yipin.

915
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,200
Everyone present witnessed it.

916
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,160
He called the police over.

917
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,680
It doesn't mean anything.

918
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,120
He saw them fighting

919
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,960
and called the police, it's a logical action.

920
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,160
We were performing!

921
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,840
Why would we be fighting?

922
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,200
When those gangsters were making a scene,

923
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,320
why did the police come?

924
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,280
Why did the police come

925
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,320
and arrest us?

926
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,360
This is such a simple explanation.

927
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,720
Why don't you understand?

928
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,920
Student Xingang, Don't worry.

929
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,280
What I mean is,

930
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,880
we can't just base it on what you say.

931
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,160
This Liu Yipin you mentioned,

932
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,520
we will question him.

933
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,720
If it's what you say it is,

934
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,400
we will take the necessary action.

935
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,240
The truth is right in front of your eyes, what more do you need?

936
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,240
Sir, are you deliberately defending

937
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,200
Zhang Fengzai and Liu Yipin?

938
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,640
How can you speak this way?

939
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,040
Everything must be evidence-based,

940
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,680
I can't simply listen to your side alone.

941
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,040
Other students will then think

942
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,080
that I am biased towards you.

943
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,520
What should I do then?

944
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,960
Indeed.

945
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,440
You cannot make baseless accusations.

946
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,280
Student Guo Xingang,

947
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,280
I remember in my class

948
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,880
you frequently had arguments with Zhang Fengzai.

949
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,320
You are not taking this opportunity to defame him aren't you?

950
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,880
Mr. Song, you know me well.

951
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,240
I will not do such things.

952
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,720
I believe you wouldn't,

953
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,640
but we need evidence.

954
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,640
If you have evidence, we will talk.

955
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,840
But...

956
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,040
Teacher Song,

957
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,000
did you pass those documents that I asked you to?

958
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,680
Not yet, there's still some details

959
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,320
that we need to finetune.

960
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,680
I don't understand.

961
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,040
As a librarian's assistant,

962
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,960
what do you do all day?

963
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,880
What's the matter?

964
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,720
Student, what's wrong?

965
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,920
He's saying we're too slow.

966
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,760
Student,

967
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,720
I apologise.

968
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,640
There are too many students borrowing books today.

969
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,840
Sorry to take up your time.

970
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,600
You think you can placate me with an apology?

971
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,200
Saying there are too many students is an excuse.

972
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,520
Are you saying it is our fault for borrowing books?

973
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,760
You should reflect on your actions

974
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,760
and not push the blame to the students.

975
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,560
Student,

976
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,600
please calm down.

977
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,200
That's not what I meant.

978
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,240
Look,

979
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,480
there really is a large number of students borrowing books today.

980
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,360
We

981
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,160
are a little slow in looking for the books.

982
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,440
How about this,

983
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,040
tell me what book you are looking for.

984
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,840
I'll look for it for you.

985
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,960
I'm not talking to you.

986
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
I want to speak to Mr. Li Dazhou personally

987
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,360
and make a complaint to the school.

988
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,120
Mr. Chen.

989
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,000
Mr. Chen.

990
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,600
Mr. Chen.

991
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,600
New assistant librarian,

992
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,480
what's going on?

993
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,680
Well,

994
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,320
today,

995
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,760
there are many people borrowing books.

996
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,680
We are a little slow looking for the books.

997
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,600
This student is getting impatient.

998
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,720
You're from Hunan?

999
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,360
Yes.

1000
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,960
Yi Baisha's student.

1001
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,240
Yes.

1002
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,400
Mao Zedong, Mao Runzhi.

1003
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:57,920
Yes.

1004
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,440
Chen Duxiu,

1005
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,720
nice to meet you.

1006
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,240
Hello, Mr. Chen.

1007
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,640
I've read your essay.

1008
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,240
I really like your writing.

1009
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,160
Student Fu Sinian,

1010
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,480
the number of students borrowing books really is high today.

1011
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,000
It is only natural that the speed is slower.

1012
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,760
I don't think this situation needs to be like this.

1013
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,440
He's new here,

1014
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,200
please be more understanding.

1015
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,640
Don't nitpick.

1016
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:27,760
Alright?

1017
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,440
Now that you've said it, sir,

1018
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,720
I won't be borrowing this book today then.
