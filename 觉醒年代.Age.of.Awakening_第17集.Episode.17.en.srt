[Wu Bingxiang, Capital Police Chief Inspector]

373
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,280
After you.

374
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,600
Salute!

375
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,280
Principal Cai

376
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
has invited all the great sages to meet here.

377
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,240
It's really unexpected.

378
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,400
However, these are the regulations,

379
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
and I have no choice but to carry them out.

380
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,280
I hope you can understand.

381
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,840
Chief Inspector Wu is very kind.

382
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,720
I resent being a little abrupt.

383
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,640
I also don't know what regulation

384
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,480
states that you, Chief Inspector Wu,

385
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,920
have to attack and imprison

386
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
my students for no reason.

387
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,400
Principal Cai, you misunderstand.

388
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Salute!

389
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
You make me more courageous.

390
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
I dare not offend you.

391
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
Principal Cai's majesty.

392
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
Please, please.

393
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,800
Please.

394
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,240
Please have a seat.

395
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,440
Mr. Cai does not know,

396
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,800
that in the past month,

397
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,640
the Capital Police has received all kinds of reports

398
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,680
accusing Peking University's Chen Duxiu and Cai Yuanpei

399
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
of advocating falsehoods, slandering the sages,

400
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,480
spreading wickedness to deceive people, and violating rights.

401
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
At the same time, they are still worried about advocating students

402
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
to perform illegal performances to disturb the peace,

403
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,040
and asking the police to crack down on them.

404
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,640
Excuse me, Chief Inspector Wu,

405
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,080
what you just said

406
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,240
is an accusation against both of us.

407
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,360
Then why don't the police arrest me?

408
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,640
Why do you want to arrest

409
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,640
and attack my students?

410
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,640
That accent sounds like it's from my hometown.

411
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,840
I have an accent?

412
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,120
No, no, no.

413
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,000
This must be the famous

414
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,120
New Culture leader, Professor Chen Duxiu.

415
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,360
Good question, fellow countryman.

416
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Why don't I arrest you?

417
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
Honestly, it's not that I dare not.

418
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
I haven't found

419
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,640
any direct evidence that you broke the law.

420
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
Similarly,

421
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
I took in four of your classmates,

422
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,120
but they did break the law.

423
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,080
If I may ask, Chief Inspector Wu,

424
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,960
the students were performing in the streets to publicize new ideas,

425
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,240
what were their crimes?

426
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,120
Another fellow countryman.

427
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,800
Hu Shi, Dr. Hu.

428
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
Okay, I'll answer you.

429
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,120
What law did they break?

430
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,240
This is from this afternoon at 2:30.

431
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,680
The Capital Police received three phone calls to report

432
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,920
that someone was performing illegally in downtown

433
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,600
to disturb the public order.

434
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,080
This one...

435
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
This is from 4:30 this afternoon.

436
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,040
The report of Qianmen Police Station

437
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,400
about arresting

438
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,560
four students, including Deng Zhongxia.

439
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
The motive for the arrest

440
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,840
was that they agigated the public

441
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
to disturb the peace and fight in brawls.

442
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,880
You see, disturbing the peace again.

443
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,320
And these.

444
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
These are all evidence materials.

445
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,080
Chief Inspector Wu.

446
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
There is no need to say more.

447
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,560
Now we just want to know

448
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,080
where the four students are and how they are.

449

Shouchang, Mr. Li Dazhao.

450
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
Sir, you can rest assured,

the four students

452
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680

453
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
and all of them are safe and sound.

454
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,760
Chief Inspector Wu, we're here to collect our people.

455
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,200
It's getting late now.

456
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,960
All our teachers and students

457
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,000
are waiting for the news that we are going back to school.

458
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,280
Principal Cai should not be too hasty.

459
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,960
As I said on the phone,

460
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,160
you can let your people go through the procedures.

461
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,520
What procedures?

462
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,680
The first thing I want to tell you

463
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,560
is that these students really broke the law

464
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
and should be severely punished according to the law.

465
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
However, due to various reasons,

466
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,400
we are lenient and can release them on bail,

467
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,280
to the school and parents

468
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
to discpline them themselves.

469
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,360
This is the bail contract.

470
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,560
I hope that both of you can fill in this form carefully

471
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,480
and bear the corresponding legal responsibilities.

472
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,520
What if we don't sign this?

473
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
Then I will follow the procedures.

474
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,400
Okay, okay.

475
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,560
It is important that we take care of our people.

476
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,040
I'll fill out this bail contract.

478
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,280
There is another reason why I wanted to invite you

479
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,120
to the police department.

480
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720
You've got a record in the police department.

481

I hope you'll take care of yourself

482
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
and don't go your own way.

483
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,480

484
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
from a fellow countryman.

485
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Then I'll thank you for being a fellow countryman.

486
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,840
A kind reminder.

487
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,800
Mr. Cai, to be fair,

489
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,640

Don't be nervous, sir.

501
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,920
It's nothing more than a fight and getting into a classroom.

502

Celebrate Chen Yannian's imprisonment today.

If you want to celebrate, you should celebrate getting out of jail.

You're celebrating getting into prison.

because you don't know it at all.

573
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm telling you. The October Revolution

574
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,160
established a socialist system of public ownership

That doesn't make sense.

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,520
I've read your article.

635
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,680
I can also do your Mao Shi Six-Step Exercises.

636
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,120
And what is your name?

637
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm Yannian.

638
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,280
This is my little brother.

639
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,013
Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

640
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,840
Qiaonian.

641
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,400
Hello.

642
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,960
Hello.

643
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,840
What book are you reading?

644
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
I just borrowed it from your library.

645
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,600
"Free Records of Real Society".

646
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,960
We are in Hunan.

647
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,160
It's rare to find this book.

648
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,000
So I thought, read it all at once.

649
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,560
Otherwise,

650
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,760
I won't have time to study

651
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,720
when I arrive at Peking University tomorrow.

652
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,520
So

653
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,080
you are also a believer in anarchism?

654
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,600
Believer?

655
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,880
Not really.

656
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,240
But I've always had an interest

657
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,040
in anarchism,

658
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
especially Krupotkin's mutual aid theory.

659
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,480
Coincidence!

660
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,480
We both believe in the theory of mutual aid.

661
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
So the three of us are comrades?

662
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,360
Comrade?

663
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,680
I guess so.

664
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,720
Comrade.

665
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,760
Are you hungry?

666
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,800
You didn't have dinner, did you?

667
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,280
I have a little something here.

668
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,000
You take it and eat it.

669
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,960
No, no, no.

670
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,760
We met by chance.

671
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,720
I can't eat your food.

672
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,760
Now that you're a comrade,

673
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,720
we have to help each other.

674
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,040
No need.

675
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,600
Thank you, thank you.

676
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:39,920
Brother Runzhi,

677
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,240
sit.

678
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Sit.

679
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,720
Sit down.

680
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,160
Let me tell you something.

681
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
Since the three of us are already comrades,

682
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,160
we can't be polite.

683
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,720
Take this.

684
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,520
Take this.

685
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,480
We'll eat with you.

686
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,560
Okay.

687
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,640
It's better to be respectful than obedient.

688
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,680
To be honest,

689
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,360
I'm really a little hungry.

690
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,640
Thank you.

691
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,480
Tastes good.

692
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,440
Brother Runzhi,

693
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,920
just now, you said you were going to a job at Peking University tomorrow.

694
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,120
Do you need help from us?

695
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,320
No need.

696
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,040
Tomorrow,

697
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,800
I'll go to my teacher, Mr. Yang Changji

698
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,840
and show him.

699
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Can you arrange for me to sit in at Peking University

700
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,800
to learn more?

701
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,560
Which class do you want to attend?

702
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,480
I want to attend to Mr. Chen Duxiu's

703
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,240
and Mr. Hu Shi's classes.

704
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,360
If I can get what I came here for,

705
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,800
my trip will be worth it.

706
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,720
I'll take care of it.

707
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,920
I'll make sure you get what you want.

708
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,440
Take care of it?

709
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,600
Mr. Zhongfu is our dad.

710
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,240
Chen Yannian.

711
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,200
Chen Qiaonian.

712
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,640
Pleased to meet you.

713
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,240
Pleased to meet you.

714
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,680
Pleased to meet you.

715
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,960
Pleased to meet you.

716
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,160
Pleased to meet you.

717
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,680
