Until now,

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,080
I have not received any clear instructions

33

from the government to sign or not to sign.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
In other words,

35

Shaochuan, I want to hear your opinion first.

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,520
My opinion is simple.

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
Even if the government insists,

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
I will never sign it.

what do you think?

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,440
Never sign.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
I drafted two statements.

51
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,520
The first one is for China.

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
The message is as follows:

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,320
After detailed review and discussion,

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,240
we have no choice but to sign.

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
The second is for the Paris Peace Conference.

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,520
We declare to not sign.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you have no objection,

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll ask the Secretary General

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920

So rescuing Mr. Chen Duxiu

194
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,120
will be the focus of our next issue.

Professor Chen, bright under the high light.

201
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,040
This one is too small. It hurts my eyes.

202
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,840
Director Wu, you should call me number 178.

203
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,560
Professor Chen is very observant of prison rules.

204

[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Professor at Peking University]

206
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,400
Today,

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,880
I'm visiting as a fellow villager.

208
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,800
Of course, I have to call you Professor Chen.

209
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,840
How are you, Professor Chen?

210
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200

After you have gone to jail,

216

you can stay and read some of the reports.

217
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,600
Thanks a lot.

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,440
Thank you, Director Wu.

219
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,880
It's me who should say thank you.

220

How do you say this?

221

You'll understand it when you read the newspaper.

222
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
Professor Chen, it is because of you.

223
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,760
I, Wu Bingxiang,

224
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,960
have suddenly become a newspaper sensation.

225
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,000
There are only two news figures in the newspaper now.

226
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
Chen Duxiu is a star-studded man.

227
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,320
I, Wu Bingxiang, have been criticized.

228
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
That's what you deserve.

229
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,200
Blame no one else.

230
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
There are also brave words.

231
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,160
You talk about this "declaration".

232
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,600
Let me read it to you.

233
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,680
Fortunately, police chief Wu Bingxiang

234
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,000
has a novel brain.

235
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,680
Although threatened by all sides

236
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,240
and secretly encouraged by the traditionalists,

237
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,880
he has never treated Chen harshly.

238
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,440
That's true.

239
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,120
It said Wu Bingxiang didn't treat you badly.

240
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
It's not true to say that the traditionalists are secretly encouraging me.

241
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,640
Look here, there are some.

242
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Ma Jichang, the leader of Tongcheng School, and Yao Yong

243
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,680
issued a statement urging the Metropolitan Police Department

244
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
to unconditionally release Chen Duxiu.

245
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,240

Not only did he make you a star in the ideological circle,

258
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
he even shouted:

259
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,440
long live Mr. Chen's supreme spirit!

260
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,000
This is too much, isn't it?

261
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,720
Director Wu,

262
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
maybe it's someone like Zedong

263
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
who will one day destroy your old world.

264
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,280
Can you destroy the old world?

265
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,560
It is too early to tell.

266
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
I want to tell Professor Chen,

267
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,520
because of your imprisonment,

268
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,720
it really brought great trouble to the government.

269
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,400
Now almost the whole of China is moving.

270
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,560
It is unprecedented.

271
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
It's an unexpected thing?

272
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,440
But this is not a good thing for Professor Chen.

273
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
Now everyone knows,

274
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,640
you are the number one political enemy of the government.

275
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,800
Many people are yelling at me to hand you over.

276
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,040
Once you get out of the police station,

277
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,080
you can imagine the consequences.

278
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,960
It's nothing more than a broken head.

279
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,680
I have no regrets

280
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
even after nine deaths.

281
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,240
However, Professor Chen,

282
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,120
now you're at the end of your rope.

283
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,960
If you can have some cooperation with my police department,

284
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,280
maybe you can have a bright future.

285
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:21,760
Maybe.

286
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,160
Stop.

287
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,720
If you say again I will be scolded.

288
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,280
Do you think I, Chen Duxiu,

289
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,320
am the kind of person

290
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,920
who can make compromises on his beliefs?

291
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,000
As expected.

292
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,040
Professor Chen is really a man of character.

293
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
So you can stick to your faith.

294
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
I stick to my duty.

295
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,240
Let's see.

296
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,120
Don't bother to see me out.

297
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:06,320
Listen not to the rain beating against the trees.

298
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,560
Why don't you slowly walk and chant with ease?

299
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,080
Better than saddled horse, I choose sandals and cane,

300
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
Oh, I would fain,

301
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:42,320
In a straw cloak, spend my life in mist and rain.

302
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
It's all you want to see

303
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,200
Good.

304

My wife knows me.

305
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
Although I'm trapped in prison these days,

306
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,840
my heart is more free to fly.

307
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,680
There are many new ideas.

308
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,920
Suffering from having nowhere to pour out.

309
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,720
It's worse than not being able to shit.

310
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
Watch your mouth. The children are here.

311
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,560

312

Let Yingying talk with you.

314
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,920
Okay, Zeimei.

315
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,960
This is good.

316
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,400
In the right context,

317
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
we are both in the cage.

318
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,200
We share the same illness, we share the same room.

319
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,720
Zhongfu, don't say such discouraging things.

320
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,200
Now all the people in China are rescuing you.

321
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,960
You will be released from prison soon.

322
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,400
That's right, Uncle Chen.

323
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,920
My father wrote that

324
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,600
Shanghai established the National Federation of Students.

325
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,960
Someone put forward a slogan

326
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,520
that said until Chen Duxiu gets out of prison, they will never resume classes.

327
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,600
I see.

328
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,560
I feel that the the core of the action now

329
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,720
has been transferred from Beijing to Shanghai.

330
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,680
The working class has stepped onto the stage of history.

331
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
This is a great event.

332
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,840

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,800
Of course I'm not isolated.

338
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,040
What are you thinking about, sir?

339
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,120
Mostly thinking about two problems:

340
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,720
Marxism and the Russian Revolution.

341
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,320
So these problems

342
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,080
are all about socialism.

343
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
Not exactly the same thing.

344
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,120
One is the original.

345
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,400
One is the latest achievement.

346
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
One is theory and the other is practice.

347
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,440
The two complement each other.

348
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,560
Yannian, I still suggest that you and Qiaonian

349
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,720
read Marx's works.

350
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Especially on 6 April,

351
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,560
that issue of the "Weekly Review"

352
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
published the second chapter of the "Communist Manifesto".

353
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,240
It can help you

354
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,840
learn more about Marxism

355
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,440
I almost forgot if you didn't tell me.

356
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,920
Mr. Shizhi asked me to bring to you

357
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
the latest two issues of the "Weekly Review".

358
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,960
Isn't Mr. Dazhao absent?

359
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,560
Mr. Shizhi took over directly.

360
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,920
Is this the "Weekly Review"?

361
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,560
Is this the "Weekly Review"

362
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,600
founded by Chen Duxiu?

363
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
Why are you so angry?

364
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,400
This is not the "Weekly Review".

365
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,320
This is a special issue of Dewey's research.

366

This Hu Shizhi,

367
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,800
not only did he cancel

368
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
the combat articles and sharp commentaries

369
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,480
reflecting the political struggle

370
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,680
to which Shouchang and I attached special importance,

371
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
he also withdrew the review of major domestic events

372
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,200
and international affairs.

373
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,040
Two columns that readers pay special attention to.

374
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,200
Look at the eight pages of these two issues.

375
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,360
All published are Dewey's research records.

376
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
What's the noise?

377
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,320
Be quiet!

378
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,280
Go!

379
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,880
Get me Hu Shi!

380
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,000
Explain it to me face to face!

381
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,600
Professor Chen,

382
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
look who I brought you.

383
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,360
Brother Zhongfu.

384
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:20,205
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

385
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,920
You're suffering.

386
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,920
Professor Chen, what's wrong with you?

387
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
So far away from people.

388
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,200
This is not the style of a mentor.

389
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,120
Director Wu,

390
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,560
I wrote an inscription especially for you.

391
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,640
Please take it.

392
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,320
To thank you for taking care of me.

393
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,720
Spring leaves Shenpu,

394
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,160
Yangtze River is long in spring.

395
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,320
Take good care of it,

396
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,200
and see the mulberry plants in sea.

397
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
This was before Su Manshu went to Japan.

398
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
The poem I gave him in Anqing.

399
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,760
There is no special meaning.

400
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,840
By convention, there should be couplets.

401
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,360
The cut

402
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,480
and the bend.

403
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,160
But here it is.

404
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,360
Just follow your rules.

405
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,680
Here.

406
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,440
Professor Chen, you really have a personality.

407
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,840
Can you write poems on this?

408
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,840
There is no big piece of paper.

409
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Do not do evil,

410
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,240
practice good.

411
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,000
Take care of yourself.

412
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,560
I must treasure it well.

413
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
This poem has a profound meaning.

414
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,800
Professor Hu,

415
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,800
today, I've touched your glory.

416
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,000
To have such a treasure.

417
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,960
You guys talk, I'll leave you alone.

418
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,680
Do not do evil,

419
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,560
practice good.

420
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,040
Brother Zhongfu.

421
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,400
Yingying with snowy claws.

422
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,360
This little thing is always with you.

423
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,840
It's better than me.

424
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,960
Brother Zhongfu.

425
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,320
A picture of my ancestors looking forward to the Hundred Days' Reform.

426
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,840
Take a look.

427
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,640
You weren't there during the Hundred Days' Reform.

428
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,000
I didn't invite a banquet.

429
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,000
Shizhi,

430
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,680
I'm sorry I spoiled your fun.

431
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,080
Brother Zhongfu,

432
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,600
I really came to make amends to you.

433
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,200
Shizhi,

434
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,400
you really have to tell me about it.

435
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,320
This is why?

436
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,000
After I took over the "Weekly Review",

437
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,760
Wu Bingxiang came to me.

438
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,000
He repeatedly warned me to talk less about current affairs

439
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,960
and talk less about politics.

440
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,560
Otherwise, it will be banned immediately

441
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,160
and I'll add guilt to you.

442
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,760
I have no choice.

443
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,840
I can only take this approach.

444
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,520
The "Weekly Review"

445
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,080
No politics, no current affairs.

446
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,520
What is the "Weekly Review"?

447
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
It's not that we don't talk about current affairs or politics.

448
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,080
Instead, they talk about important current affairs and specific politics.

449
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
Brother Zhongfu, don't you think

450
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,680
Professor Dewey's coming to China is a current event?

451
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,960
that Professor Dewey's special issue is politics?

452
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,640
that Professor Dewey's experimentalism

453
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,960
of governing the people are all in your favor?

454
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,040
This is politics.

455
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,200
What you said is not unreasonable.

456
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,040
But I think

457
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,800
the top priority now

458
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,280
is to borrow the east wind of the May Fourth Movement

459
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,040
and well publicize it

460
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
to encourage the people

461
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,840
to fundamentally transform our society

462
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,600
to find a scientific way to save the country and the people.

463
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,520
The Two magazines.

464
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
The main idea of "New Youth" is enlightenment.

465
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,360
The "Weekly Review" guides the mass movement.

466
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
The two magazines complement each other.

467
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
They have to play their roles.

468
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,360
Finding your way is really important.

469
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
The key is to pay attention to some scientific methods.

470
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,480
I thought that now we

471
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,320
must study more questions

472
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,600
and talk less about socialism.

473
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,440
Brother Zhongfu, talking is wrong for the country

474
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,320
This truth must be told more.

475
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,480
Shizhi, your point of view is worth squeezing.

476
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,360
Without good scientific guidance,

477
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,440
how can we study the problem well?

478
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,440
You're asking for nothing.

479
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,720
This view of yours

480
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,400
will be criticized by Shouchang.

481
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,200
Right?

482
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,880
You're right.

483
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,880
Now I don't know why

484
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,880
Shouchang's and my ideas

485
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,080
are getting more and more divergent.

486
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,680
He is now fully focused

487
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,000
on the violent revolution in Soviet Russia,

488
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,920
moving towards Bolshevism.

489
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,680
It's dangerous.

490
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,120
Shizhi.

491
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,200
Three of us.

492
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,840
Shouchang is a fan of Russia.

493
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,520
You are a fan of the United States.

494
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,360
I used to be a fan of France.

495
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,960
But now I'm

496
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,520
more and more inclined to Shouchang's Russian camp.

497
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,440
The question you asked just now,

498
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,240
I advocate for a debate.

499
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,480
Okay, I'll take the lead.

500
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,360
But now Shouchang and I must be opposites.

501
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,840
Brother Zhongfu, which side are you on?

502
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
Let me write you an inscription, too.

503
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,720

504
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,440
Right away.

505
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,080
Okay.

506
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,760
Yannian, time to eat.

507
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,440
I won't eat. You can eat first.

Where are you packing for?

509

I'll find Mr. Dazhao

510

and see if he can save Chen Duxiu.

511
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
Then where are you going to find them?

512
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,360
He's at Hanwengong Temple.

513
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

514
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,840
I'll pack my bags, too.

515
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
Why? Come here.

What's going on?

517
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,760
I'm not going to take you there.

518
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,200
What do you mean?

519
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,720
I'll do this alone.

520
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,960
You'd better listen and go back to Shanghai.

521
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,640
My family is in this situation.

522
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,840
It's not good for you either

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
and it may involve your family.

524
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,840

Where are you going?

537
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,040

[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

539
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,360
you will be able to eat white buns, right?

540
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,360
After contributions and taxes,

541
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,360
there isn't much wheat left.

542
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,040
I am reluctant to eat at ordinary times.

543
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,280
I save it for festivals.

544
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,720
Usually eaten at home,

545
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
or sweet potato or corn.

546
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,000
This is not enough to eat.

547
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
There are not many shops here.

548
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,480
Can you plant more and count more?

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,560
What if it's not enough to eat?

550
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
Usually eat less.

551
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,600
Eat dry food during the farming season and eat thin food during the day.

552
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,240
If you can't eat enough, go out and borrow some.

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,400
yet the day is still so hard

558
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,720
and you have to go out and beg for food.

559
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,400
What is the truth of this?

560
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,360
Life.

561
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,280
Life as a horse and cow.

562
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,120
No way out.

563
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,400
Can't compete with your types.

564
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,160
A teacher who knows how to read.

565
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,560
It's not our destiny to be cattle and horses.

566
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,800
Life, huh?

567
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
We have to decide for ourselves.

568
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,680
Ride!

569
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,120
Uncle Li.

570
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,120
Someone wants to see you.

571
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,000
Who?

572
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:54,800
Go!

573
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,400
Yannian.

574
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,360
Sir.

575
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,720
Hello, sir.

576
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,040
There won't be any bad news, will there?

577
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,000
Is your dad okay?

578
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,560
He's fine.

579
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,400
The police department just sent out a message

580
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
and said to hold a press briefing

581
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
to make public his situation in prison.

582
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,240
That's good.

583
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,600
Then why are you here looking for me?

584
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,400
I want you to do something,

585
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,720
see if you can get him out early.

586
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
You two are quite interesting.

587
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,160
Arguing when we meet.

588
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,840
But what about the critical moment?

589
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,200
You're pretty good with him.

590
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,720
Not caring about him.

591
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm worried about me, auntie.

592
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,360
She was so anxious that she couldn't sleep all night.

593
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,240
You boy.

594
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,760
Just keep your mouth shut.

595
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,160
Come and take off your clothes.

596
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,360
Help me chop wood.

597
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,240
Okay.

598
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
Actually, about your father,

599
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,440
you have nothing to worry about.

600
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,360
He is far-sighted, but he has no near worries.

601
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,040
What do you mean?

602
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,440
What do you mean?

603
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,840
Your father's case is important to them.

604
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,680
It's actually quite tricky.

605
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,160
There should be two opinions now.

606
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,480
The first opinion

607
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,320
is that of the generals of the Anfu Club,

608
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,120
led by Cao Rulin and Wang Huaiqing, who had been removed from their posts.

609
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,480
They will kill brother Zhongfu, and then do it quickly.

610
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,080
Another opinion

611
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,240
is that of the new Premier Gong Xinzhan.

612
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,040
He advocated the release of your father to reassure the people.

613
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,920
What about President Xu Shichang's wishful thinking?

614
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,200
Trying to use your father as a pawn

615
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,520
to negotiate with the Southern government

616
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,520
Understand?

617
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,480
The tripartite forces are involved in a wide range.

618
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,720
If your father is outside,

619
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,480
then you will probably be involved

620
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,680
in the political struggle.

621
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,000
I guess I'll have to skin it if I die.

622
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
But as it happens, he is inside now.

623
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,520
Instead, we avoided this disaster.

624
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,800
That is to say

625
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,760
it's wise not to do anything

626
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,040
right now.

627
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,240
Not doing nothing,

628
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,880
but not doing it openly.

629
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,360
Actually the Students' Federation

630
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,320
has been secretly guiding the direction of public opinion.

631
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,520
As long as people's mood reaches a critical point,

632
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,000
everything will be solved.

633
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,120
Then I'll be clear when you say so.

634
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,640
Now that you're here,

635
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,840
stay here for a few more days.

636
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,120
Let's do farm work during the day

637
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,880
and read books together in the evening.

638
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,480
Just in time, Zhao Shiyan, Zhongxie,

639
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,880
Yi Qunxian will come in a couple of days.

640
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,480
It's only

641
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
that the life here is a bit poor.

642
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,960
Sir.

643
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,400
I would love to have that.

644
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,040
Your conditions here are really not bad.

645
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,800
I've lived in far worse places than here.

646
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,920
Sir, you have prepared so many dishes.

647
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,880
Can you eat by yourself?

648
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,640
These dishes are all sent by fellow villagers.

649
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,560
They are working in the ground now.

650
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,640
Let's eat together at night.

651
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,520
All right.

652
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,240
Journalists!

653
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,680
I have just finished reporting to you

654
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,160
the circumstances of Mr. Chen Duxiu's arrest

655
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,160
and his situation in the detention center.

656
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,120
I would like to answer three questions from you.

657
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,440
Please.

658
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,520
Mr. Chen Duxiu is already held at the police station

659
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,320
for a month.

660
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,160
May I ask Director Wu, will he be convicted?

661
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,120
What will be the crime?

662
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,080
How many years will it take?

663
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,880
Will Mr. Chen Duxiu be convicted?

664
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,800
What crime? How many years?

665
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,640
It is still under investigation.

666
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,480
I can only answer this question so much.

667
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:05,920
Please.

668
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,520
Just introduced information

669
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,520
that Mr. Chen Duxiu received preferential treatment in prison.

670
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,320
Excuse me, Director Wu,

671
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,960
what specific preferential treatment did Mr. Chen receive?

672
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,560
Mr. Chen is a celebrity.

673
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,520
What he committed involved many factors.

674
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,440
Therefore, he received special preferential treatment.

675
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,960
Like his food.

676
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,520
It refers to the standards of the first-class superintendent.

677
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,760
Solitary confinement

678
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,080
means, that within a certain range,

679
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,360
he is free

680
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,960
to read books and newspapers and write.

681
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,440
Friends and relatives and his colleagues

682
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,560
can visit him.

683
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
I can tell you responsibly,

684
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,080
this month

685
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,000
Mr. Chen Duxiu gained four pounds.

686
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,480
Director Wu,

687
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
the media in Beijing are eager to form a group.

688
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,480
or go to the police station alone

689
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,840
to interview Mr. Chen Duxiu,

690
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,600
or allow us to publish some

691
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
words written by Professor Chen in prison.

692
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,560
Director Wu, please grant permission.

693
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,920
During the investigation period,

694

no interview.

695
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,680
Do not publish articles.

What the media wants

697
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,560
should be in accordance with

698

the notification from the Metropolitan Police Department.

One is in Mengzhou, Henan.

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,520
Mr. Zhongfu's has a deep study

741
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,280
of the Confucian tradition.

742
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,200
The reason why I live here

743
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
is also to express my respect

744
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,640
to the ancient literary master

745
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Mr. Han Yu.

746
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,440
I reread recently

747
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,880
several articles by Mr. Han Yu

748
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,720
and benefited a lot from them.

749
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,920
Mr. Han Yu had a difficult life.

750
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,600
For the poem and the essay, it directly points out the bad governance of the time.

751
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:18,308
[He Mengxiong, Visiting student at Peking University]

752
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,400
Speaking with truth and generosity.

753
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,120
The thought of his article

754
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
can be said that it is glorious and ancient.

755
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,320
Students, isn't the purpose of our struggle today

756
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,680
to eradicate the bad governance of China?

757
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,520
So everyone must

758
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,120
know this clearly.

759
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,480
Mr. Shouchang.

760
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,600
Some time ago,

761
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,640
when Uncle Chen was editing

762
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,840
the manuscript of "New Youth"

763
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,040
This is the content.

764
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,720
I wrote a letter to Mr. Zhang Tuzhao

765
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,560
about this viewpoint of yours.

766
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
I remember when he read it to us,

767
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,160
said it would be published

768
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,360
in the next issue of "New Youth".

769
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,640
Is this letter still there?

770
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
When the police ransacked the house, they found it.

771
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,680
Remind your father to get it back then.

772
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,600
Come on, students.

773
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,960
Let's go in and have a look.

774
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,240
Come on, come on, students.

775
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,680
Let's take a look back.

776
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,160
This is my humble room.

777
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,160
The room is humble, but my heart is noble.

778
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,720
And here,

779
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,760
this will be our little classroom from now on.

780
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,640
Is it all right?

781
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,520
It's good!

782
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,800
Qunxian.

783
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,560
Wash the fruit for everyone.

784
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,600
Give everyone some.

785
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay.

786
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,520
The fruit here is particularly good.

787
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,240
Qiaonian.

788
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,320
Go there and get some stools and set them up.

789
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,720
Okay.

790
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,560
Zhongxie.

791
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,400
Tell us all about the situation.

792
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:38,880
Okay.

793
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,680
Mr. Cai called a few days ago

794
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,720
the Peking University Student Affairs Office

795
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,560
to give up resignation

796
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,400
and wait until his stomach trouble is cured,

797
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,680
only then can he go back to school.

798
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,320
Okay.

799
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,400
Mr. Zhongfu's case,

800
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,160
according to Mr. Zhang Shizhao,

801
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,080
the police department didn't find

802
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,600
any evidence of his breaking the law.

803
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,120
So in a few days,

804
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,960
Mr. Zhongfu will be released from prison.

805
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,320
This is good news.

806
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,240
Overall speaking,

807
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,680
after the Paris Peace Treaty was refused,

808
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,680
the situation in the whole country has gradually stabilized.

809
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,520
A few days ago,

810
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,640
All-China Federation of Students has decided to end the strike.

811
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,480
After the summer vacation, classes will officially resume.

812
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,600
Peace talks between the North and South governments,

813
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,960
although it has been two months,

814
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,520
it seems that the prospect is not very optimistic.

815
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,960
But the most important thing is

816
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,720
the May Fourth Movement

817
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,120
has awakened the patriotic enthusiasm of the whole country.

818
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,400
From the initial student movement,

819
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,800
it has gradually evolved into the whole country

820
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,440
to even the patriotic national salvation movement of all Chinese.

821
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,520
Guess what western critics say?

822
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,640
What did they said?

823
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,120
The lions of East Asia have awakened.

824
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,040
Great!

825
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,000
Students

826
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,520
I have Changli specialty wine here.

827
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,680
To the May Fourth Movement,

828
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,880
let's drink!

829
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,680
Let's drink!

830
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,000
Okay.

831
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,120
Sir.

832
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,800
I don't drink.

833
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,520
Substitute tea for wine.

834
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:57,760
Okay.

835
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,440
Me too. Me too.

836
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,080
Here's to the May Fourth Movement.

837
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,120
Cheers.

838
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,840
Everybody sit down.

839
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,680
Students.

840
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,560
We are all witnesses of the May Fourth Movement.

841
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,520
The May Fourth Movement was great.

842
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,760
Then I want to ask my classmates.

843
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,160
What is the greatness of the May 4th Movement?

844
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,200
Large scale, and large number of people,

845
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,000
then all walks of life took part.

846
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,240
Qunxian is right.
