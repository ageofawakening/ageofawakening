[Episode Three]

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,360
I invited you here today

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,640
because I want to repair my image in your minds.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,080
This is the batch that just came out.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,760
Please enjoy.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
That's wonderful!

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,080
Wait, wait, wait!

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,680
It's not finished, it's not finished!

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,560
I can't write this for nothing.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,920
It has to be commissioned.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,920
Brother Zhong Fu.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,480
Your writing is in a class of its own.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,720
It's hard to find a good writer.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,240
As long as the gentleman is willing to write for us,

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,360
it's not a problem.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,160
Okay, then I won't charge more.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,560
Two hundred silver dollars per print.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,400
Don't worry, no problem!

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,320
Good!

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,862
Don't!

22
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:54,825
Don't rush!

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
We're not done yet.

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,320
I'd like to write more than one.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
One per month.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,400
What do you think?

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,080
One per month...

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,080
Yes, monthly.

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
No, it's a bit strange, isn't it?

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,703

Aiyo... yoyoyo...

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,160
This is rare.

34
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,640
One per month!

35
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,480
I've been with Zhongfu for so many years

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that I don't even have one of his calligraphies in my hand.

37
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,840
Naturally.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,640
What about you?

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll take it if you won't.

40
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,760
Brother Mengzou, Brother Zhong Fu.

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,160
You seem to have ulterior motives.

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,920
Right!

43
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,480
One per month, 200 per print.

44
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,427
We'll take it!

45
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:35,200
Take it!

46
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Good, Brother Menzou, write up the contract.

47
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,920

But where is the money?

59
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
Cut quickly!

What are you two doing in the house?

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,080
Is it hot?

63
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,720
Come and eat watermelon. Eat watermelon.

64
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,840
Come on, it's sweet. Come on, come on.

65

What's this?

77
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,560
It's for Zimei.

78

79

81

How's it going? What's the situation in Shanghai?

108
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
The anti-Yuan movement has taken root in people's hearts,

109
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
it is unstoppable.

110
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
It's just that the Yuan forces' repressive tactics

111
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
are getting more and more brutal.

112
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,200
Yes, there were many deaths everywhere.

It's not that I'm efficient,

122
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
it's that we've all been so desperate for so long

123
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,120
that we're going crazy.

124
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,680
It's a great opportunity to be active!

125
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000

Alright.

129
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,560
The situation is now in our favour.

130
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,440
The world powers are at war in Europe

131
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,760
and can't be bothered with our China.

by increasing suppression of anti-Yuan activists.

135
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,120
But such a high-handed policy

136
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,520
has instead given us

137
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,960
a lot of public support.

138
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Thus Mr. Zhongshan and General Huang Xing

139
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,200
asked us to take active action

140
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
to protect our country,

141
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,480
as soon as the time is right,

Whenever there is an incident in Yunnan,

149
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480

Nice work!

152
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,320
Why do I get the impression

153
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
that Zhong Fu is in charge of the army?

154
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
It's only been three days, you seem different than before.

155
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
I've heard you've got something big.

156
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Tell us about it.

157
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,040
I can't continue fighting and quarrelling forever.

158
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm still doing my old job, writing.

159
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,320
For the past two months, I and Baisha have been staying at home

160
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
running a magazine called "Youth Magazine".

161
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,080
The goal was to promote a new culture,

162
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
to create a new generation of young people

163
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,120
with the most advanced ideas

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
and theories in the world,

165
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,480
in order to replace the one that has ruled China for thousands of years:

166
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,080
the Three Principles of Confucianism.

167
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
Under the banner of science and democracy,

168
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
a new generation of youth will be reinvented.

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,280
This is a sketch of the inaugural issue.

170
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Gentlemen, share your thoughts.

171
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,880
Brother Zhong Fu,

172
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
why is there a foreigner on this cover?

173
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,960
Who is this?

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
Carnegie!

175
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,920
The steel king and philanthropist.

176
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
He is Scottish.

177
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
At the age of eleven, he moved to America

178
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
and worked in a textile factory to make ends meet.

179
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,520
Firing boilers,

180
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
working as a courrier...

181
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,160
Then, through his own ingenuity and hard work,

182
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,960
established his own company

183
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,640
alongside Rockefeller and Morgan

184
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,680
creating a steel empire...

185
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,080
It became one of the three giants of the American economy.

186
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,280
The reason I put Carnegie

187
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,400
as the cover of our inaugural issue

188
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,400
is that we want to tell

189
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
the children of China who are still suffering

190
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,760
that the way of the world is left to the people of this world

191
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
and where there is a will, there is a way.

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,960
Zhong Fu, you promote new cultures and new ideas.

193
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
I'm all for it.

194
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,720
But if you reject Confucianism in its entirety,

195
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
I cannot accept.

196
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,920
Brother Xing Yan, not all of it.

197
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,480
Listen to me carefully

198
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,560
and in detail.

199
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,840
Let's go.

200
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,451
[Aurora University auditorium, Shanghai]

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Some people say that you, Chen Duxiu, started a magazine

202
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,040
to awaken the nation's political 

203
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
and ethical consciousness.

204
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,120
So what is this awakening?

205
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
As everyone knows,

206
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,560
after Lin Zexu banned opium,

207
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
the British invaded China.

208
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
With their strong ships and powerful guns,

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
we were defeated.

210
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,320
So some people suggested

211
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,240
that we should learn from the barbarians to control them.

212
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,960
This is the first awakening.

213
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,600
Knowing that you are not as good as others

214
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,240
and the need to learn from them.

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,000
Later on, some people also further realized

216
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,040
that we are not only inferior in skills

217
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,080
but also in country.

218
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,480
The foreigners had a more advanced system than we did,

219
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,320
so they came up with the Hundred Days' Reform and the New Deal of the late Qing Dynasty.

220
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,680
Until the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial system

221
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,920
and established a republic.

222
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,840
This is the second awakening.

223
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,480
But what about the establishment of the Republic?

224
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
The foreigners are still bullying us.

225
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,920
The people still don't have enough to eat.

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,760
Here's why.

227
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,480
It's not just that we're not as good as others,

228
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,960
with a system not as good as theirs.

229
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,400
The most fundamental thing

230
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,520
is our ideological and moral philosophy.

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,400
which is less advanced than others.

232
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,080
That's why I say that all enlightenment

233
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
is ultimately the enlightenment of the mind

234
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,160
and the awareness of moral philosophy.

235
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
This is the final awakening.

236
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
In the end, it's all about human awareness.

237
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,840
This final awakening is to change our minds

238
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,240
to find the most advanced ideas in the world

239
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,960
to arm our people

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,800
to shape a new generation of youth

241
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,320
to create a new nation!

242
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes! Yes! Yes!

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
For the new youth in contemporary China,

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
I think there should be six criteria.

245
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
First, one must be independent, not servile.

246
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,520
Second, one must be progressive, not conservative.

247
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,040
Third, one must be aggressive, not reclusive.

248
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,040
Fourth, one must be international, not isolated.

249
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,200
Fifth, one must be practical, not illusory.

250
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,840
Sixth, one must be scientific, not imaginary.

251
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
The six criteria are,

252
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,560
in a nutshell, that science and democracy

253
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,520
should create a new generation of young people,

254
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
and the only way to do this is to use both science and democracy.

255
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,520
Science and democracy are the criteria

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,840
by which politics, law, ethics, academia,

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
social customs 

258
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,400
and the daily lives of people

259
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
are judged.

260
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,080
Anything that is contrary to science and democracy,

261
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,920
even if it is the legacy of our ancestors,

262
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,800
the teachings of our sages

263
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
and the veneration of society

264
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
is not worth promoting.

265
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,600
Yes! Yes! Yes!

266
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,120
Science and democracy are the sunrise,

267
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
but today

268
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,960
the country is a mouldy, rotten

269
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,560

271
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,200
How about letting the sun of science and democracy

272
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,880
shine on the house?

273
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,240
In the past we used the simplest method,

274
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,960
knocking down old houses.

275
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,640
But you knocked down the house!

276
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,640
The mould, the sores, the glue are still hidden inside.

277

What grows is still rotten and dirty.

278
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,440
So, China must be strong.

279

but more importantly,

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,120

My opinion is that

288
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,080
we should start with the daily life

289
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,760
that is in our hearts and minds,

290
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,520

and write words that everyone can read.

294
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,120

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,400
You too.

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,080
You've misunderstood

373
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,840
this classmate.

374
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,360
He is

375
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,720
looking for a friend

376
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,400
with the same common purpose of serving the country.

377
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
How grand.

378
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,600
You all

379
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,880
seem to be making a pact of brotherhood.
[Cai Hesen's mother, Ge Jianhao]

380
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,480
Who is this '28 Strokes Student'?

381
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,480

Oh, Runzhi.

388
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880

One for each.

One book a person.

at our recruitment meeting,

427
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,560
let's discuss this,

428
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
and nothing else.

429

This really is a treasure.

Everyone,

434
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,760
This is Mr. Chen Duxiu's "The Youth Magazine."

435
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,880
Mr. Yang Changji

436
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,560
has already recommended it to us many times.

437
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
He says it is the prescription to save the nation.

438
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,400
Run Huan is right.

439
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,680
This is the remedy that will save lives.

440
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,000
I've only

441
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
briefly skimmed the founding statement.

442
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
Reading

443
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,560
"A Call to the Youth"

444
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I felt as if

445
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
I've been struck by a thunderbolt.

446
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,640
Absolutely enlightening!

447
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,600
Runzhi,

448
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
You've bought so many issues at once.

449
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,520
How are you going to eat this month?

450
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,640
'Tis enough to have this book.

451
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,160
Runzhi,

452
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,600
don't worry and read your book.

453
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,960
If you do get hungry

454
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,200
come to Mother Ge

455
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,040
and you'll definitely

456
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,280
eat your fill.

457
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,680
Here. Great.

458
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm actually hungry.

459
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
You've reminded me.

460
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,520
Mother Ge,

461
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,320
remember to make it spicy.

462
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,800
The very spicy kind.

463
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,160
Got it for you.

464
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,000
Thank you!

465
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,440
Everyone,

466
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,240
I'm so energized.

467
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,520
Haven't we always been talking

468
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,200
about creating a new people?

469
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,800
Well, what is the new youth?

470
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,960
Mr. Chen Zhongfu

471
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,720
right here

472
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,120
talks about six criteria.

473
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,240
Be independent, and not servile.

474
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,800
Be progressive, and not conservative.

475
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,520
Be aggressive, and not retiring.

476
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,840
Be cosmopolitan, and not isolationist.

477
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,280
Be utilitarian, and not formalistic.

478
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,680
Be scientific, and not fanciful.

479
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,800
Wonderfully put!

480
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
The six criteria proposed by Mr. Zhongfu

481
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,240
is exactly the direction to work towards

482
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,360
for my generation.

483
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,880
True.

484
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,320
These six criteria are good,

485
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,600
but I don't think

486
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,560
they are comprehensive enough.

487
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
What do you mean?

488
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,680
I just feel

489
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
there needs to be at least one more.

490
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,440
Be sturdy, and not frail.

491
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,400
Tell me more.

492
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,840
Everyone,

493
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,160
our nation's scholars are more often

494
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,160
bookish and frail.

495
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,120
A military spirit has not been encouraged.

496
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,280
Only when the young people boldly striving to save the country

497
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,520
are physically strong,

498
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
can their efforts be similarily vigorous.

499
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,680
Then the moniker bestowed on us by foreigners

500
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,160
"the sick man of Asia"

501
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,400
can be actually thrown off completely.

502
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,560
Well said. Makes sense.

503
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,200
I approve.

504
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,160
I approve as well.

505
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,520
Yes, I also agree.

506
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,320
You're getting soaked!

507
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,120
Don't worry.

508
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,080
He's just like this.

509
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,160
Civilized in spirit

510
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440


511
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,520
With both strength of body and strength of convictions

512
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,800
There's nothing on earth that's impossible.

513
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,480
Everyone,

514
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,600
This is

515
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,080
the new youth of China.

516
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,640
I've thought about it.

517
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
I am going to contribute to "Youth Magazine"

518
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
and discuss in depth

519
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,600
the physical education of Chinese people.

520
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,920
Good, good.

521
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,760
Like many young students

522
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,280
who struggled to find the truest way to save the country,

523
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,400
Moa Zedong's eyes were opened by the magazine "New Youth."

524
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,560
He started to explore

525
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,520
the ideas of the early New Culture Movement.

526
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,200
During this period,

527
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
he wrote these words in his diary:

528
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,600
In struggling with the sky, is there boundless joy.

529
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,780
In struggling with the earth, is there boundless joy.

530
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
In struggling with the people, is there boundless joy.

531
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,400
Students,
[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

532
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,160
I read
[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

533
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,040
this newly published "Youth Magazine"

534
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,000
and was immediately attracted by the

535
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,120
inaugural address "A Call to Youth" by Mr.Chen Duxiu.
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiang Yu, Nankai School Student]

536
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,160
It was like a bright lamp

537
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,440
that illuminated my mind,

538
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,840
It made me feel like

539
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,240
everything I've thought and learned and done before

540
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
was all for nought.

541
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,560
Therefore, I plan to switch

542
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,960
my oral reading

543
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,640
with this issue of "Youth Magazine"

544
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,560
to share my delight with everyone.

545
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,520
Compariots desiring to leave the age of ignorance,

546
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,800
ashamed of their simple mindedness,

547
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,680
and eager to catch up,

548
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,440
must pay equal attention to scientific knowledge and human rights.

549
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
Our scholars do not know science.

550
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,400
So they follow the Naturalists' School of auspicious signs and five elements.

551
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Confusing the world and cheating the people.

552
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,600
Our farmers do not know science.

553
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,600
So they have no methods for seed selection or insecticide.

554
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,200
Our industrialists do not know science.

555
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,200
So goods lie wasted on the ground,

556
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,600
as we are dependent on foreign countries.

557
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
Our merchants do not know science.

558
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,720
So they only care about short term profits,

559
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,760
without any thought for planning for the future.

560
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,400
Our physicians do not know science.

561
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,000
So they are not acquainted with human anatomy.

562
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,840
The truth

563
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,120
in the universe is boundless.

564
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,440
The fertile realms of science awaiting the trailblazer

565
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,720
are immense!

566
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,040
Youth, take up the task!

567
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,000
[Shanghai]

568
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,640
Strike your little gong.

569
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,000
"Youth Magazine" has been published.

570
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Chinese society has many difficulties.

571
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,840
Mr. Chen Duxiu has shared two prescriptions with the public.

572
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,320
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science

573
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,720
has already come to China.

574
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,320
King of steel, Carnegie.

575
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
That's Carnegie, not Shmarnegie.

576
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,440
Wonderful! Wonderful!

577
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,000
Turns out he was originally just a working boy.

578
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,720
Great!

579
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,800
Hello, excuse me.

580
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,520
Take a look, take a peek.

581
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,720
"Youth Magazine"

582
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science are here.

583
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,600
See how Carnegie fulfilled the American Dream.

584
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,300
How he went from a worker to the king of steel!

585
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,160
Here, take a look.

586
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:11,120
"Youth Magazine" Come, take a look.
Newest edition.

587
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,960
Take a look.

588
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,120
Together?

589
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,280
Thank you, thank you.

590
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,480
"Youth Magazine"

591
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,160
He's from my hometown.

592
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
His name is Hu Shi.

593
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,200
When he was nineteen years old

594
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,680
he went to study abroad in the US,

595
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,480
first at Cornell University to study agricultural science,

596
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
then he switched his major to literature.

597
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
He went to Columbia University this year

598
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,760
to study with that well-known professor, John Dewey,

599
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,000
for a doctorate of philosophy.

600
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,600
It can be said that this child

601
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,320
is proficient in literature, history, and philosophy.

602
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,120
He saw an issue of our "Youth Magazine"
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Cun, New Culture Movement activist]

603
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,360
and was very excited.

604
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,920
He's sent a letter

605
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,820
and wants to write an article regarding the revolution in literature.

606
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,920
So I would like to solicit your opinions.

607
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,080
That's great!

608
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,480
This topic of literary revolution is great.

609
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,560
I really didn't expect

610
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,080
a student who has been overseas for years

611
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,860
to be capable of seeing the purpose of my magazine

633
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
so incisively.

634
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,080
Genius!

635
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,440
A kindred spirit!

636
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,840
Alright, Zhong Fu

637
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,640
A sworn friend!

638
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
That's enough.

639
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,520
Zhong Fu, a young man's letter

640
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
can get you so excited?

641
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Aren't you too ridiculous?

642
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,240
Not by half!

622
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,600
Ideological guidance cannot be idle chit-chat, 

623
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,880
but start from a concrete basis

624
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,400
that focuses on the lives of the masses.

625
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,160
"Literary Revolution: A Tentative Proposal"

626
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,160
If this article is written properly,

627
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,960
it will be a bombshell!

628
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,280
Bai Sha, the younger generation will in time surpass us!

629
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,200
This Hu Shi

630
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,040
is too important for our "Youth Magazine."

631
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,040
Must grab him!

632
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,040
Oh Zhong Fu,

633
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,400
in this time and age,

634
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,640
it's not easy to find a genius

635
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,840
who can catch your eye.

636
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
Though don't get too hung up on it.

637
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,200
This guy is a doctoral student in the United States,

638
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
and a disciple of Professor Dewey.

639
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,840
As if you can grab him just by saying so.

640
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,200
This guy lives in the United States.

641
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Whether he can even come back is an issue.

642
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,400
No, no. This I can guarantee.

664
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,760
He will definitely return to China after completing his studies.

665
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,440
How can one be sure?

666
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
This guy, Hu Shi,

667
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,640
is a filial son.

668
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,360
Before he went abroad to study,

669
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,360
his mother arranged a marriage for him.

670
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
His mother can't wait to get a grandson.

671
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,160
So she writes him letters every few days

672
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,040
telling him to come back after he finishes his studies to get married.

673
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,800
He would not dare to disobey his mother.

674
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,720
This person is really too wonderful.

675
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
His thinking is wonderful.

676
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,600
What?

656
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,340
Grab him!

657
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,040
Grab him as soon as he comes back.

658
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,680
Junman!

659
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,320
Here, let me.

660
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,520
Why is your cough so bad?

661
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,320
You took your medicine?

662
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,120
I did. It's not effective.

663
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,480
It's not effective?

664
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
You have to keep taking it.

665
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,000
How can the medicine work if you don't keep taking it?

666
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,800
I've finished it.

667
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,240
But there were no results.

668
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,320
You've finished it.

669
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,440
Ok, alright.

670
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,760
Don't work any more.

671
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,800
Go rest in the house.

672
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
Let me sit here for a bit.

673
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,800
Get some air.

674
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,160
Then wait. I will go buy medicine.

675
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,040
You don't need to go.

676
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,400
The drawer has long run out of money.

677
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,200
The money you gave me last month is all used up.

678
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,720
It's an old problem.

679
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
It'll pass.

680
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,800
Don't worry. I'm not dying.

681
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,800
Gao Junman!

682
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,360
Don't work anymore!

683
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,600
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

684
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
Go inside and rest.

685
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,600
Wait for me.

686
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,600
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

687
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,120
Can't cook if the firewood's not chopped!

688
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,680
Zhong Fu,

689
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,520
why are you here in such a heavy rain?

690
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,680
Just dropping by.

691
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,680
Pour your own tea if you want.

692
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,600
Those the accounts?

693
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,880
So today,

694
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,400
I ran around to collect the money.

695
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,840
To date, our "Youth Magazine"

696
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,880
has sold 2000 copies in total,

697
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,840
breaking even.

698
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
The principal has basically been recouped.

699
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,040
That's great.

700
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,080
That's a good thing, right?

701
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,320
Mengzou,

702
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,760
My uh...

703
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,480
This issue's payment for uh,

704
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,480
for my editorial.

705
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,640
Is that included in the capital?

706
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm calculating the big accounts.

707
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,320
Haven't had a chance yet to take you into consideration.

708
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,800
Hold on, you have to take me into consideration as well.

709
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
If your capital has been recouped

710
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,240
then shouldn't the payment for my editorial

711
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,920
be given back to me?

712
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,400
Alright, then let me take you into consideration right now.

713
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,440
Let me see,

714
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,040
Your manuscript fee, editorial fee

715
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,920
added together

716
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,840
is 138 silver dollars.

717
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,600
However, you've asked three times for an advance.

718
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
The first time, for 4 silver dollars.

719
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
The second time, also for 4 silver dollars.

720
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,680
