00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,640


704
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,080


705
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,320


706
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,800


707
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520


708
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,240


709
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,920


710
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,400


711
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,440


712
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,040


713
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,920


714
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,840


715
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,600


716
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560


717
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520


718
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,680


719
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,360


720
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,560


721
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,560


722
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,000


723
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,880


724
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,840


725
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,600


726
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600


727
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,680
I borrowed/lent money three times (?)

728
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,600
4 dollars two times. 10 dollars one time. 

729
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,240
Why don't I have any impression of this?

730
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,320
These matters, you don't need to think over it.

731
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,840
These are the matters I'll look after. 

732
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,040
As for you, great thinker

733
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,560
just unhesitatingly let out your brilliance.

734
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,520
Zhong Fu,

735
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,520
you say, this Yuan Shikai

736
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,520
this determination to be an emperor (?)

737
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,920
makes the heavens angry and causes people to resent (?)

738
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,680
This authority, right now also has no time

739
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,120
to look after ?upper? Revolution party members (?)

740
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,040
As soon as the current political situation starts to ease

741
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,360
this business opportunity, it will come.

742
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,080
I want to seize onto the opportunity, go out and recruit shares (?)

743
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
With your great persona, you have a lot of acquaintances

744
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,520
Bring over more people with money to invest (?)

745
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,040
This magazine of ours, maybe it will resume operations (?)

746
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,680
Alright. No problem.

747
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,000
You're responsible for finding people, I'll show up (?)

748
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,440
As long as the magazine can be managed well,

749
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,560
whatever you have me do is fine.

750
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,080
Uncle Wang

751
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,800
You've come back

752
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,400
Dad

753
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,800
Why have you come back so early today?

754
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,400
It's raining today, impossible to work (?)

755
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,040
Mengzou

756
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,600
This... Yannian and Qiaonian doing editing here (?)

757
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,600
isn't it that they should have pay too?

758
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,920
I gave it to them, Yannian didn't want it.

759
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,680
Speaking about this pay, 

760
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,400
it's made up for in my accommodation fees here(?)

761
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,320
I want to properly discuss with you (?)

762
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,720
these two children's matters. 

763
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,920
In the daytime, they are working at the port.

764
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,920
At night, they come over to my place to be editors.

765
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640
And they still need to learn French.

766
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,560
Wouldn't you say these two children are too tired

767
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,880
That is to say, the two brothers living costs right now, 

768
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,160
all depends on the salary from the port (?)

769
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
That's right.

770
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,720
I have also heard, at the port they

771
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,520
extended the working time.  

772
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,320
I quietly asked Qiaonian

773
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,720
what's going on?

774
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,040
He said it's for collecting the tuition to learn French (?)

775
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,800
You say, what to do?

776
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,720
This child, right now

777
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,600
the time when his body is growing (?)

778
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,000
If he's like this, wouldn't his body break down?

779
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,640
You say, what to do with this?

780
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,240
Those two, if they didn't want the editing pay

781
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,960
you should give it me. 

782
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,880
I am his father.

783
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,800
It should be me... Receiving it...

784
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,480
It should be normal too, right?

785
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,680
What! This is...(?)

786
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,440
That's another matter!

787
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,440
Didn't I already tell you?

788
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,360
Yannian had the pay

789
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,680
included it in the accommodation fees here (?)

790
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,240
You still say your son and you are very similar,

791
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,800
not even a little similar.

792
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,440
He, give him money and he doesn't want it.

793
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,480
You here, keep going on and on with me.

794
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,760
This is 50 silver dollars. 

795
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,320
100 silver dollars.

796
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,240
This is 20.

797
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,200
Dad, what are you giving me so much.. 

798
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,160
Listen to me.

799
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,040
This money, I give it to you two brothers to pay tuition.

800
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,360
Understand?

801
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,720
Quickly go.

802
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,880
Zhong Fu.

803
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,080
You already gave it.

804
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,360
Mengzou.

805
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,960
You say, just now

806
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,360
said something like I borrowed/lent money three times. (?)

807
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,400
4 dollars two times 10 dollars one time.

808
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,720
 When was that?

809
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,480
How come I don't have any impression.

810
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,200
Let me look at the account. (?)

811
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,320
Don't talk about these things with me anymore. 

812
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,320
I'll draw some money for you again (?)

813
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,560
Not for drawing some money for me again (?)

814
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,040
I'll look at the account. How come I didn't...

815
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,240
Stop there!

816
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,800
Chen Yannian

817
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,960
This money is to give you two brothers to pay tuition.

818
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,960
Am I wrong?

819
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,960
Don't need it.

820
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,520
Today, you say it to me clearly. 

821
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,640
What is it about me that you are so against? 

822
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,000
You are too greedy.

823
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,471
Want both family and to love your country. (?)

824
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:03,829
I want to have a family and to love my country, 

825
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:05,200
Is there a conflict between these two (?)

826
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
There is a conflict. 

827
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,320
If you want to love your country, then you must give up the family.

828
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,720
Otherwise, you will only give the family

829
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,040
an even greater harm (?)

830
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,040
You really feel your assertion has value? (?)

831
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,560
At least, currently, yes

832
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,280
Good! Then you keep insisting! 

833
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,200
Go! Go!

834
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,680
Yannian. Yannian!

835
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,760
Zhong Fu!

836
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,600
Being older, want to chat (?)

837
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,640
but it collapses with a single conversation (?)

838
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:46,759
[Japan's Waseda University dorm room]

839
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,520
Shouchang (his other name)

840
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,320
Did you see the announcement at the school's entrance?

841
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,960


842
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,640


843
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,080
I saw it. This was within my expectations.

844
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,040
Originally was grouped together for a few months. (?)

845
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,400
It's done now. There are results. (?)

846
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,160
I can completely focus on taking care of the revolution now.

847
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,040
Brother Shouchang

848
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,560
It's completely me who harmed you

849
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:11,114
At that time, I really shouldn't have insisted on pulling you

850
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,800
to be the editor-in-chief of 《MinYi》magazine.

851
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,400
You were originally at the Association of Students Staying in Japan (?)

852
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,120
being the head editor in the literature and history committee (?)

853
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,240
and already very busy (?)

854
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,520
It doesn't have to do with you.

855
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,360
It's me who likes to edit magazines.

856
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
Right now, Yuan Shikai acts an emperor.

857
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,360
The country is already successfully thrown into a complete mess. 

858
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,680
I absolutely can not calm down my heart to read books.

859
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
What plans do you have?

860
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,080
First, wholeheartedly 

861
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,960
edit the first issue of《MinYi》magazine

862
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,800
Have it become the overseas bugle horn that denounces Yuan Shikai. (?)

863
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,600
Then, I'll return to the country. Head to the battlefield.

864
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
Listening to you like this, I also can't sit still.

865
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,200
Anyway, I am also graduating soon

866
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,800
When the time comes, I'll return with you.

867
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,240
but returning to the main topic,

868
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,840
if we're really going to the firing line to fire guns and battle (?)

869
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,440
I don't know if I can do it.

870
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,120
Who said to ? Yuan Shikai you must use real swords, real guns (?)

871
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,160
Our Chen Duxiu takes care of instructing the young people's thinking (?)

872
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
that way also ? Yuan Shikai

873
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,840
Moreover, it ? from the root up.

874
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
It's not bad compared to the results of a firearm. (?)

875
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,560
Shouchang, I heard that his magazine

876
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,880
ran into big trouble.

877
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,280
Already stopped publishing.

878
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,360
I know.

879
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,720
Small trouble. It's almost resolved. 

880
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,040
Just change the publication name, and it's fine.

881
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
Right now, I am in the middle of

882
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,880
writing an article for  ... (?)

883
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,680
You are? I want to take a look (?)

884
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,760
《Youth》Good topic.

885
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,320
This long?

886
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,160
I'll read it to you. You try to feel it. (?)

887
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes, yes.

888
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,400
Once earth turns into _ (?)

889
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,960
We are still in our youth

890
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,600
Use our youth (?)

891
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,280
To softly change earth's _ (?)

892
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,240
Although old, still not yet old (?)

893
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,000
earth's one day of existence (?)

894
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,529
that is our youth's one day of existence (?)

895
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,300
Our youth's one day of existence (?)

896
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,114
That is earth's youth's one day of existence (?)

897
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,360
In 1916,

898
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,920
Li Dazhao wrote down a famous piece (?) 

899
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,120
《Youth》in Japan (?)

900
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
The article used an uplifting revolutionary spirit (?)

901
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,720
And the life approach of a scientific person (?)

902
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Expressed an obvious materialistic ideology (?)

903
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,400
Proposed to reform the ideal views of China's youth (?)

904
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,800
To appeal the youth to

905
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,760
burst past the historical fetters (?)

906
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,600
Destroy the prison of cliched theory (?)

907
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,200
Use the spirit of youth to continuously transform yourself (?)

908
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,400
Use the vitality of youth, the ideals of youth

909
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Wake up the old China from the century of dormancy (?)

910
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,600
Establish a youthful China

911
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,080
[Shanghai first-rate fragrant hotel] (?)

Hurry, hurry, hurry. (?)

912
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Hurry, come warm up in the fire (?)

913
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,080
Quickly sit, quickly sit. Warm up.

914
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,720
Knowing I came back

915
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,200
You guys even came to see me.  Good!

916
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,120
By contrast, your guys' father

917
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,200
don't know if he doesn't welcome me back

918
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,920
Or he is scared that I will snatch his profits (?)

919
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,560
so he's pulling his strong card with me (?)

920
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,880
It's already been so long, and he doesn't come to see me.

921
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,720
Truly not even as good as the children. (?)

922
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,440
What is Chen Duxiu busy with.

923
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,160
《Youth Magazine》 became renowned with other people.

924
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,880
It was sued by others for violating their right to reputation (?)

925
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,880
and so stopped publishing. (?)

926
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,440
He is continuously occupied with the dispute (?)

927
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,960
Who has such bad eyesight (?)

928
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,440
Dare to dispute with the enlightened great master Chen Duxiu (?)

929
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,200
Isn't this finding trouble by yourself?

930
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,240
Okay, okay. Let's not talk about him now.

931
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,120
How are you guys doing?

932
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,720
Living, isn't it very tough?

933
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,440
We aren't afraid of hardship!

934
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,960
We two have been working while studying.

935
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,240
Getting by very substantially (?)

936
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,640
Good. Good.

937
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,120
I didn't misjudge you guys.

938
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,200
I'll tell you guys.

939
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,760
I returned this time

940
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
First is to assist in overthrowing Yuan Shikai's _ (?)

941
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,400
Second is to launch a campaign for a work-study program for those who will stay in France (?)

942
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Didn't you guys want to go to France?

943
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,080
Let me test you guys.

944
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,400
Nowadays, what is the most popular theory in the West? (?)

945
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,160
Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution

946
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,000
That's not simple,

947
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,240
who told you this?

948
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,440
I also sneakily heard it. (?)

949
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,920
Hunan and Anhui comrades held a meeting (?)

950
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,800
Chen Duxiu gave everyone

951
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,240
an explanation on the Theory of Evolution for a whole morning (?)

952
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,920
saying that natural selection is an unchanging truth

953
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,720
and is the motivation for human progress (?)

954
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,240
In this, Chen Duxiu is ignorant and narrow-minded (?)

955
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,960
He only knows the first thing and not the second.

956
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,960
Actually, the popular theory nowadays

957
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,000
is not Darwin's Theory of Evolution,

958
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,000
rather it's Kropotkin's Theory of Mutual Assistance.

959
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,080
Come.

960
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,840
This is some material from France I specially 

961
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
brought back for you guys.

962
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,920
You guys carefully take a look at it.

963
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,360
I guarantee

964
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,960
As you guys understand it more and more, 

965
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,440
you will for sure deeply fall in love with it.

966
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,240
Take a look, take a look.

967
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,560
March 1916

968
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
at home and abroad, in the middle of the denouncing atmosphere (?)

969
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,040
Yuan Shikai was forced to cancel his autocratic monarchy (?)

970
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,240
A shameful performance full of a farce to restore an autocratic monarchy (?)

971
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,360
came to a premature end

972
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,120
Since the Xinhai Revolution, 

973
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,560
So they can

974
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,560
advocate to establish a bourgeoisie republic

975
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,760
to break away from China's current state

976
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,040
The old democratic revolution (?)

977
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
lead by China's bourgeoisie (?)

978
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
cannot obtain the extensive support of the working class

979
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,160
Hitting a wall in all directions. Suffer defeat in every battle. (?)

980
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,760
Difficult situation (?)

981
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,120
Yuan Shikai, who represents the feudal power of China (?)

982
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,440
regarded as taking away the achievements of the Xinhai Revolution,
 met with spurn after his death. (?)

983
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,640
Revolutionists who were forced into exile overseas returned to the country one after another

984
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,440
Li Dazhao

985
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,840
invited to visit Beijing (?)

986
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,920
took the post of editor-in-chief of Morning Bell Newspaper (?)

987
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,800
Now, going through the (?) of the movement to overthrow Yuan Shikai

988
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,840
Initially accepting (?)

989
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,040
The historical materialism point of view, Li Dazhao (?)

990
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


991
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,120
already became a revolutionary full of new ideas (?)

992
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:12,814
[Beijing Qianmen Street]

993
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,320
Brother. Where is your home at? (?)

994
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,880
Outside Yongdingmen. The untouchable one. (?)

995
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,560
Why do you say this? (?)

996
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,360
Those who pull carts, wield skill in trade (?)

997
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,640
have shaved heads, are pig butchers, coffin carriers (?)

998
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,880
all live over there (?)

999
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,160
Then how is getting by in life right now for you guys (?)

1000
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,320
Impossible to get by. Everyone's suffering until they can't take it anymore. (?)

1001
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,240
According to the older generations' saying,

1002
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,920
we have never gone through such sullen days.
