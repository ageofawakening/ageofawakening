00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,560
"A Call to the Youth"

444
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I felt as if

445
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
I've been struck by a thunderbolt.

446
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,640
Absolutely enlightening!

447
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,600
Runzhi,

448
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
You've bought so many issues at once.

449
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,520
How are you going to eat this month?

450
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,640
'Tis enough to have this book.

451
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,160
Runzhi,

452
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,600
don't worry and read your book.

453
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,960
If you do get hungry

454
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,200
come to Mother Ge

455
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,040
and you'll definitely

456
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,280
eat your fill.

457
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,680
Here. Great.

458
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm actually hungry.

459
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
You've reminded me.

460
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,520
Mother Ge,

461
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,320
remember to make it spicy.

462
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,800
The very spicy kind.

463
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,160
Got it for you.

464
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,000
Thank you!

465
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,440
Everyone,

466
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,240
I'm so energized.

467
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,520
Haven't we always been talking

468
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,200
about creating a new people?

469
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,800
Well, what is the new youth?

470
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,960
Mr. Chen Zhongfu

471
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,720
right here

472
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,120
talks about six criteria.

473
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,240
Be independent, and not servile.

474
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,800
Be progressive, and not conservative.

475
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,520
Be aggressive, and not retiring.

476
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,840
Be cosmopolitan, and not isolationist.

477
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,280
Be utilitarian, and not formalistic.

478
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,680
Be scientific, and not fanciful.

479
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,800
Wonderfully put!

480
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
The six criteria proposed by Mr. Zhongfu

481
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,240
is exactly the direction to work towards

482
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,360
for my generation.

483
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,880
True.

484
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,320
These six criteria are good,

485
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,600
but I don't think

486
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,560
they are comprehensive enough.

487
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
What do you mean?

488
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,680
I just feel

489
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
there needs to be at least one more.

490
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,440
Be sturdy, and not frail.

491
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,400
Tell me more.

492
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,840
Everyone,

493
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,160
our nation's scholars are more often

494
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,160
bookish and frail.

495
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,120
A military spirit has not been encouraged.

496
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,280
Only when the young people boldly striving to save the country

497
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,520
are physically strong,

498
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
can their efforts be similarily vigorous.

499
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,680
Then the moniker bestowed on us by foreigners

500
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,160
"the sick man of Asia"

501
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,400
can be actually thrown off completely.

502
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,560
Well said. Makes sense.

503
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,200
I approve.

504
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,160
I approve as well.

505
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,520
Yes, I also agree.

506
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,320
You're getting soaked!

507
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,120
Don't worry.

508
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,080
He's just like this.

509
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,160
Civilized in spirit

510
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440


511
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,520
With both strength of body and strength of convictions

512
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,800
There's nothing on earth that's impossible.

513
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,480
Everyone,

514
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,600
This is

515
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,080
the new youth of China.

516
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,640
I've thought about it.

517
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
I am going to contribute to "Youth Magazine"

518
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
and discuss in depth

519
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,600
the physical education of Chinese people.

520
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,920
Good, good.

521
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,760
Like many young students

522
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,280
who struggled to find the truest way to save the country,

523
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,400
Moa Zedong's eyes were opened by the magazine "New Youth."

524
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,560
He started to explore

525
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,520
the ideas of the early New Culture Movement.

526
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,200
During this period,

527
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
he wrote these words in his diary:

528
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,600
In struggling with the sky, is there boundless joy.

529
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,780
In struggling with the earth, is there boundless joy.

530
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
In struggling with the people, is there boundless joy.

531
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,400
Students,
[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

532
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,160
I read
[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

533
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,040
this newly published "Youth Magazine"

534
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,000
and was immediately attracted by the

535
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,120
inaugural address "A Call to Youth" by Mr.Chen Duxiu.
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiang Yu, Nankai School Student]

536
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,160
It was like a bright lamp

537
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,440
that illuminated my mind,

538
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,840
It made me feel like

539
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,240
everything I've thought and learned and done before

540
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
was all for nought.

541
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,560
Therefore, I plan to switch

542
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,960
my oral reading

543
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,640
with this issue of "Youth Magazine"

544
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,560
to share my delight with everyone.

545
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,520
Compariots desiring to leave the age of ignorance,

546
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,800
ashamed of their simple mindedness,

547
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,680
and eager to catch up,

548
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,440
must pay equal attention to scientific knowledge and human rights.

549
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
Our scholars do not know science.

550
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,400
So they follow the Naturalists' School of auspicious signs and five elements.

551
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Confusing the world and cheating the people.

552
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,600
Our farmers do not know science.

553
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,600
So they have no methods for seed selection or insecticide.

554
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,200
Our industrialists do not know science.

555
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,200
So goods lie wasted on the ground,

556
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,600
as we are dependent on foreign countries.

557
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
Our merchants do not know science.

558
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,720
So they only care about short term profits,

559
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,760
without any thought for planning for the future.

560
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,400
Our physicians do not know science.

561
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,000
So they are not acquainted with human anatomy.

562
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,840
The truth

563
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,120
in the universe is boundless.

564
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,440
The fertile realms of science awaiting the trailblazer

565
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,720
are immense!

566
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,040
Youth, take up the task!

567
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,000
[Shanghai]

568
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,640
Strike your little gong.

569
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,000
"Youth Magazine" has been published.

570
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Chinese society has many difficulties.

571
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,840
Mr. Chen Duxiu has shared two prescriptions with the public.

572
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,320
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science

573
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,720
has already come to China.

574
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,320
King of steel, Carnegie.

575
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
That's Carnegie, not Shmarnegie.

576
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,440
Wonderful! Wonderful!

577
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,000
Turns out he was originally just a working boy.

578
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,720
Great!

579
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,800
Hello, excuse me.

580
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,520
Take a look, take a peek.

581
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,720
"Youth Magazine"

582
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science are here.

583
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,600
See how Carnegie fulfilled the American Dream.

584
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,300
How he went from a worker to the king of steel!

585
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,160
Here, take a look.

586
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:11,120
"Youth Magazine" Come, take a look.
Newest edition.

587
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,960
Take a look.

588
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,120
Together?

589
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,280
Thank you, thank you.

590
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,480
"Youth Magazine"

591
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,160
He's from my hometown.

592
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
His name is Hu Shi.

593
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,200
When he was nineteen years old

594
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,680
he went to study abroad in the US,

595
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,480
first at Cornell University to study agricultural science,

596
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
then he switched his major to literature.

597
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
He went to Columbia University this year

598
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,760
to study with that well-known professor, John Dewey,

599
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,000
for a doctorate of philosophy.

600
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,600
It can be said that this child

601
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,320
is proficient in literature, history, and philosophy.

602
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,120
He saw an issue of our "Youth Magazine"
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Cun, New Culture Movement activist]

603
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,360
and was very excited.

604
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,920
He's sent a letter

605
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,820
and wants to write an article regarding the revolution in literature.

606
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,920
So I would like to solicit your opinions.

607
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,080
That's great!

608
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,480
This topic of literary revolution is great.

609
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,560
I really didn't expect

610
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,080
a student who has been overseas for years

611
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,860
to be capable of seeing the purpose of my magazine

612
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
so incisively.

613
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,080
Genius!

614
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,440
A kindred spirit!

615
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,840
Alright, Zhong Fu

616
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,640
A sworn friend!

617
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
That's enough.

618
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,520
Zhong Fu, a young man's letter

619
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
can get you so excited?

620
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Aren't you too ridiculous?

621
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,240
Not by half!

622
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,600
Ideological guidance cannot be idle chit-chat, 

623
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,880
but start from a concrete basis

624
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,400
that focuses on the lives of the masses.

625
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,160
"Literary Revolution: A Tentative Proposal"

626
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,160
If this article is written properly,

627
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,960
it will be a bombshell!

628
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,280
Bai Sha, the younger generation will in time surpass us!

629
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,200
This Hu Shi

630
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,040
is too important for our "Youth Magazine."

631
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,040
Must grab him!

632
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,040
Oh Zhong Fu,

633
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,400
in this time and age,

634
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,640
it's not easy to find a genius

635
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,840
who can catch your eye.

636
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
Though don't get too hung up on it.

637
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,200
This guy is a doctoral student in the United States,

638
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
and a disciple of Professor Dewey.

639
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,840
As if you can grab him just by saying so.

640
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,200
This guy lives in the United States.

641
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Whether he can even come back is an issue.

642
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,400
No, no. This I can guarantee.

643
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,760
He will definitely return to China after completing his studies.

644
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,440
How can one be sure?

645
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
This guy, Hu Shi,

646
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,640
is a filial son.

647
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,360
Before he went abroad to study,

648
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,360
his mother arranged a marriage for him.

649
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
His mother can't wait to get a grandson.

650
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,160
So she writes him letters every few days

651
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,040
telling him to come back after he finishes his studies to get married.

652
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,800
He would not dare to disobey his mother.

653
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,720
This person is really too wonderful.

654
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
His thinking is wonderful.

655
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,600
What?

656
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,340
Grab him!

657
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,040
Grab him as soon as he comes back.

658
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,680
Junman!

659
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,320
Here, let me.

660
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,520
Why is your cough so bad?

661
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,320
You took your medicine?

662
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,120
I did. It's not effective.

663
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,480
It's not effective?

664
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
You have to keep taking it.

665
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,000
How can the medicine work if you don't keep taking it?

666
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,800
I've finished it.

667
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,240
But there were no results.

668
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,320
You've finished it.

669
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,440
Ok, alright.

670
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,760
Don't work any more.

671
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,800
Go rest in the house.

672
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
Let me sit here for a bit.

673
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,800
Get some air.

674
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,160
Then wait. I will go buy medicine.

675
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,040
You don't need to go.

676
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,400
The drawer has long run out of money.

677
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,200
The money you gave me last month is all used up.

678
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,720
It's an old problem.

679
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
It'll pass.

680
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,800
Don't worry. I'm not dying.

681
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,800
Gao Junman!

682
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,360
Don't work anymore!

683
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,600
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

684
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
Go inside and rest.

685
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,600
Wait for me.

686
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,600
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

687
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,120
Can't cook if the firewood's not chopped!

688
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,680
Zhong Fu,

689
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,520
why are you here in such a heavy rain?

690
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,680
Just dropping by.

691
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,680
Pour your own tea if you want.

692
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,600
Those the accounts?

693
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,880
So today,

694
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,400
I ran around to collect the money.

695
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,840
To date, our "Youth Magazine"

696
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,880
has sold 2000 copies in total,

697
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,840
breaking even.

698
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
The principal has basically been recouped.

699
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,040
That's great.

700
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,080
That's a good thing, right?

701
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,320
Mengzou,

702
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,760
My uh...

703
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,480
This issue's payment for uh,

704
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,480
for my editorial.

705
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,640
Is that included in the capital?

706
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm calculating the big accounts.

707
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,320
Haven't had a chance yet to take you into consideration.

708
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,800
Hold on, you have to take me into consideration as well.

709
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
If your capital has been recouped

710
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,240
then shouldn't the payment for my editorial

711
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,920
be given back to me?

712
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,400
Alright, then let me take you into consideration right now.

713
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,440
Let me see,

714
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,040
Your manuscript fee, editorial fee

715
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,920
added together

716
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,840
is 138 silver dollars.

717
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,600
However, you've asked three times for an advance.

718
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
The first time, for 4 silver dollars.

719
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
The second time, also for 4 silver dollars.

720
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,680
The third time, for 10 silver dollars.

721
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,360
18 all together.

722
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,560
138 minus 18 

723
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,560
So you should get

724
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,000
120 silver dollars, correct?

725
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,880
I'll give it to you right now.

726
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,840
Fifty.

727
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,840
One hundred.

728
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,600
One twenty.

729
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600
Take it.

730
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,680


731
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,600


732
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,240


733
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,320


734
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,840


735
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,040


736
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,560


737
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,520


738
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,520


739
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,520


740
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,920


741
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,680


742
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,120


743
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,040


744
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,360


745
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,080


746
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440


747
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,520


748
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,040


749
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,680


750
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,000


751
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,440


752
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,560


753
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,080


754
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,800


755
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,400


756
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,800


757
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,400


758
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,040


759
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,600


760
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,600


761
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,920


762
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,680


763
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,400


764
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,320


765
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,720


766
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,920


767
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,920


768
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640


769
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,560


770
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,880


771
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,160


772
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400


773
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,720


774
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,520


775
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,320


776
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,720


777
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,040


778
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,800


779
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,720


780
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,600


781
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,000


782
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,640


783
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,240


784
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,960


785
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,880


786
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,800


787
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,480


788
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,680


789
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,440

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,440


791
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,360

00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,680

00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,360

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,880


806
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,080


807
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,360


808
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,960
