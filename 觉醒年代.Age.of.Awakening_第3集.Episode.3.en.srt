[Episode Three]

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,360
I invited you here today

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,640
because I want to repair my image in your minds.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,080
This is the batch that just came out.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,760
Please enjoy.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
That's wonderful!

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,080
Wait, wait, wait!

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,680
It's not finished, it's not finished!

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,560
I can't write this for nothing.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,920
It has to be commissioned.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,920
Brother Zhong Fu.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,480
Your writing is in a class of its own.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,720
It's hard to find a good writer.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,240
As long as the gentleman is willing to write for us,

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,360
it's not a problem.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,160
Okay, then I won't charge more.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,560
Two hundred silver dollars per print.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,400
Don't worry, no problem!

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,320
Good!

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,862
Don't!

22
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:54,825
Don't rush!

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
We're not done yet.

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,320
I'd like to write more than one.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
One per month.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,400
What do you think?

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,080
One per month...

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,080
Yes, monthly.

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
No, it's a bit strange, isn't it?

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,703

Aiyo... yoyoyo...

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,160
This is rare.

34
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,640
One per month!

35
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,480
I've been with Zhongfu for so many years

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that I don't even have one of his calligraphies in my hand.

37
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,840
Naturally.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,640
What about you?

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll take it if you won't.

40
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,760
Brother Mengzou, Brother Zhong Fu.

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,160
You seem to have ulterior motives.

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,920
Right!

43
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,480
One per month, 200 per print.

44
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,427
We'll take it!

45
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:35,200
Take it!

46
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Good, Brother Menzou, write up the contract.

47
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,920

But where is the money?

59
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
Cut quickly!

What are you two doing in the house?

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,080
Is it hot?

63
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,720
Come and eat watermelon. Eat watermelon.

64
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,840
Come on, it's sweet. Come on, come on.

65

What's this?

77
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,560
It's for Zimei.

78

79

81

How's it going? What's the situation in Shanghai?

108
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
The anti-Yuan movement has taken root in people's hearts,

109
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
it is unstoppable.

110
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
It's just that the Yuan forces' repressive tactics

111
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
are getting more and more brutal.

112
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,200
Yes, there were many deaths everywhere.

It's not that I'm efficient,

122
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
it's that we've all been so desperate for so long

123
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,120
that we're going crazy.

124
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,680
It's a great opportunity to be active!

125
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000

Alright.

129
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,560
The situation is now in our favour.

130
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,440
The world powers are at war in Europe

131
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,760
and can't be bothered with our China.

by increasing suppression of anti-Yuan activists.

135
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,120
But such a high-handed policy

136
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,520
has instead given us

137
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,960
a lot of public support.

138
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Thus Mr. Zhongshan and General Huang Xing

139
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,200
asked us to take active action

140
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
to protect our country,

141
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,480
as soon as the time is right,

Whenever there is an incident in Yunnan,

149
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480

Nice work!

152
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,320
Why do I get the impression

153
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
that Zhong Fu is in charge of the army?

154
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
It's only been three days, you seem different than before.

155
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
I've heard you've got something big.

156
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Tell us about it.

157
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,040
I can't continue fighting and quarrelling forever.

158
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm still doing my old job, writing.

159
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,320
For the past two months, I and Baisha have been staying at home

160
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
running a magazine called "Youth Magazine".

161
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,080
The goal was to promote a new culture,

162
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
to create a new generation of young people

163
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,120
with the most advanced ideas

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
and theories in the world,

165
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,480
in order to replace the one that has ruled China for thousands of years:

166
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,080
the Three Principles of Confucianism.

167
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
Under the banner of science and democracy,

168
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
a new generation of youth will be reinvented.

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,280
This is a sketch of the inaugural issue.

170
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Gentlemen, share your thoughts.

171
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,880
Brother Zhong Fu,

172
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
why is there a foreigner on this cover?

173
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,960
Who is this?

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
Carnegie!

175
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,920
The steel king and philanthropist.

176
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
He is Scottish.

177
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
At the age of eleven, he moved to America

178
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
and worked in a textile factory to make ends meet.

179
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,520
Firing boilers,

180
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
working as a courrier...

181
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,160
Then, through his own ingenuity and hard work,

182
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,960
established his own company

183
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,640
alongside Rockefeller and Morgan

184
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,680
creating a steel empire...

185
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,080
It became one of the three giants of the American economy.

186
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,280
The reason I put Carnegie

187
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,400
as the cover of our inaugural issue

188
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,400
is that we want to tell

189
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
the children of China who are still suffering

190
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,760
that the way of the world is left to the people of this world

191
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
and where there is a will, there is a way.

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,960
Zhong Fu, you promote new cultures and new ideas.

193
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
I'm all for it.

194
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,720
But if you reject Confucianism in its entirety,

195
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
I cannot accept.

196
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,920
Brother Xing Yan, not all of it.

197
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,480
Listen to me carefully

198
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,560
and in detail.

199
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,840
Let's go.

200
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,451
[Aurora University auditorium, Shanghai]

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Some people say that you, Chen Duxiu, started a magazine

202
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,040
to awaken the nation's political 

203
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
and ethical consciousness.

204
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,120
So what is this awakening?

205
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
As everyone knows,

206
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,560
after Lin Zexu banned opium,

207
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
the British invaded China.

208
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
With their strong ships and powerful guns,

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
we were defeated.

210
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,320
So some people suggested

211
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,240
that we should learn from the barbarians to control them.

212
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,960
This is the first awakening.

213
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,600
Knowing that you are not as good as others

214
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,240
and the need to learn from them.

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,000
Later on, some people also further realized

216
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,040
that we are not only inferior in skills

217
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,080
but also in country.

218
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,480
The foreigners had a more advanced system than we did,

219
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,320
so they came up with the Hundred Days' Reform and the New Deal of the late Qing Dynasty.

220
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,680
Until the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial system

221
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,920
and established a republic.

222
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,840
This is the second awakening.

223
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,480
But what about the establishment of the Republic?

224
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
The foreigners are still bullying us.

225
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,920
The people still don't have enough to eat.

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,760
Here's why.

227
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,480
It's not just that we're not as good as others,

228
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,960
with a system not as good as theirs.

229
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,400
The most fundamental thing

230
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,520
is our ideological and moral philosophy.

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,400
which is less advanced than others.

232
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,080
That's why I say that all enlightenment

233
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
is ultimately the enlightenment of the mind

234
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,160
and the awareness of moral philosophy.

235
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
This is the final awakening.

236
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
In the end, it's all about human awareness.

237
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,840
This final awakening is to change our minds

238
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,240
to find the most advanced ideas in the world

239
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,960
to arm our people

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,800
to shape a new generation of youth

241
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,320
to create a new nation!

242
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes! Yes! Yes!

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
For the new youth in contemporary China,

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
I think there should be six criteria.

245
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
First, one must be independent, not servile.

246
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,520
Second, one must be progressive, not conservative.

247
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,040
Third, one must be aggressive, not reclusive.

248
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,040
Fourth, one must be international, not isolated.

249
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,200
Fifth, one must be practical, not illusory.

250
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,840
Sixth, one must be scientific, not imaginary.

251
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
The six criteria are,

252
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,560
in a nutshell, that science and democracy

253
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,520
should create a new generation of young people,

254
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
and the only way to do this is to use both science and democracy.

255
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,520
Science and democracy are the criteria

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,840
by which politics, law, ethics, academia,

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
social customs 

258
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,400
and the daily lives of people

259
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
are judged.

260
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,080
Anything that is contrary to science and democracy,

261
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,920
even if it is the legacy of our ancestors,

262
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,800
the teachings of our sages

263
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
and the veneration of society

264
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
is not worth promoting.

265
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,600
Yes! Yes! Yes!

266
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,120
Science and democracy are the sunrise,

267
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
but today

268
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,960
the country is a mouldy, rotten

269
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,560

271
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,200
How about letting the sun of science and democracy

272
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,880
shine on the house?

273
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,240
In the past we used the simplest method,

274
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,960
knocking down old houses.

275
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,640
But you knocked down the house!

276
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,640
The mould, the sores, the glue are still hidden inside.

277

What grows is still rotten and dirty.

278
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,440
So, China must be strong.

279

but more importantly,

My opinion is that

288
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,080
we should start with the daily life

289
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,760
that is in our hearts and minds,

290
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,520

and write words that everyone can read.

294
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,120

Here, try it.
[He Shuheng, student at Hunan Provincial First Normal School]

371
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,400
You too.

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,080
You've misunderstood

373
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,840
this classmate.

374
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,360
He is

375
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,720
looking for a friend

376
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,400
with the same common purpose of serving the country.

377
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
How grand.

378
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,600
You all

379
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,880
seem to be making a pact of brotherhood.
[Ge Jianhao, mother of Cai Heseen]

380
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,480
Who is this '28 Strokes Student'?

381
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,480
Ma, '28 Strokes Student'

382
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,320
is Mao Zedong.

383
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,840
You know, Runzhi.

384
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,960
Oh, Runzhi.

385
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,080

Which one of you is '28 Strokes Student'?
[Xiao Zisheng, student at Hunan Provincial First Normal School]

389
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,280
Hello, hello.

390
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,240
I am here to apply for the meeting of friends.

391
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,520
My name is Cai Hesen.

392
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,160
How do you do?

393

This is Xiao Zisheng.

394

My hands are covered with ink.

Eat first.

403
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,200
Ok.

404
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,200

405
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
28 Strokes Student is back.

Mother Ge.

407
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,520
You've worked hard.

408
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,160
Runzhi,

409
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880
What are you talking about?

410
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,600
"Sent to the foothills"

411
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,480
"Hidden in the famous mountains"

412
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,600
Ah, right.

413
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,480
From "The Book of Documents"

414
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,480
"Sent to the foothills"

415
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,280
"Though he is late because of thunder and rain, he is not lost."

416
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,320

Please sit.

Take a look at my treasure.

00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,880
Sure.

434
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,200

To the side.

Lost your manners?

Here.

442
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,640
Look.

443
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,280
This is my treasure.

444
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,320
One for each.

445
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
One book a person.

446
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Today,

447
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,760
at our recruitment meeting,

448
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,560
let's discuss this,

449
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
and nothing else.

450
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Come, take a look.

451
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Look at this first,

452
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,920
Look, look.

453
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,120
This really is a treasure.

454
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,160
Everyone,

455
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,760
This is Mr. Chen Duxiu's "The Youth Magazine."

456
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,880
Mr. Yang Changji

457
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,560
has already recommended it to us many times.

458
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
He says it is the prescription to save the nation.

459
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,400
Run Huan is right.

460
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,680
This is the remedy that will save lives.

461
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,000
I've only

462
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
briefly skimmed the founding statement.

463
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
Reading

464
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,560
"A Call to the Youth"

465
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I felt as if

466
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
I've been struck by a thunderbolt.

467
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,640
Absolutely enlightening!

468
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,600
Runzhi,

469
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
You've bought so many issues at once.

470
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,520
How are you going to eat this month?

471
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,640
'Tis enough to have this book.

472
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,160
Runzhi,

473
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,600
don't worry and read your book.

474
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,960
If you do get hungry

475
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,200
come to Mother Ge

476
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,040
and you'll definitely

477
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,280
eat your fill.

478
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,680
Here. Great.

479
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm actually hungry.

480
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
You've reminded me.

481
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,520
Mother Ge,

482
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,320
remember to make it spicy.

483
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,800
The very spicy kind.

484
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,160
Got it for you.

485
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,000
Thank you!

486
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,440
Everyone,

487
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,240
I'm so energized.

488
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,520
Haven't we always been talking

489
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,200
about creating a new people?

490
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,800
Well, what is the new youth?

491
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,960
Mr. Chen Zhongfu

492
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,720
right here

493
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,120
talks about six criteria.

494
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,240
Be independent, and not servile.

495
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,800
Be progressive, and not conservative.

496
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,520
Be aggressive, and not retiring.

497
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,840
Be cosmopolitan, and not isolationist.

498
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,280
Be utilitarian, and not formalistic.

499
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,680
Be scientific, and not fanciful.

500
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,800
Wonderfully put!

501
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
The six criteria proposed by Mr. Zhongfu

502
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,240
is exactly the direction to work towards

503
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,360
for my generation.

504
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,880
True.

505
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,320
These six criteria are good,

506
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,600
but I don't think

507
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,560
they are comprehensive enough.

508
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
What do you mean?

509
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,680
I just feel

510
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
there needs to be at least one more.

511
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,440
Be sturdy, and not frail.

512
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,400
Tell me more.

513
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,840
Everyone,

514
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,160
our nation's scholars are more often

515
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,160
bookish and frail.

516
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,120
A military spirit has not been encouraged.

517
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,280
Only when the young people boldly striving to save the country

518
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,520
are physically strong,

519
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
can their efforts be similarily vigorous.

520
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,680
Then the moniker bestowed on us by foreigners

521
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,160
"the sick man of Asia"

522
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,400
can be actually thrown off completely.

523
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,560
Well said. Makes sense.

524
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,200
I approve.

525
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,160
I approve as well.

526
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,520
Yes, I also agree.

527
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,320
You're getting soaked!

528
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,120
Don't worry.

529
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,080
He's just like this.

530
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,160
Civilize the mind,

531
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440
make savage the body.

532
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,520
With both strength of body and strength of convictions

533
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,800
There's nothing on earth that's impossible.

534
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,480
Everyone,

535
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,600
This is

536
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,080
the new youth of China.

537
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,640
I've thought about it.

538
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
I am going to contribute to "Youth Magazine"

539
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
and discuss in depth

540
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,600
the physical education of Chinese people.

541
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,920
Good, good.

542
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,760
Like many young students

543
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,280
who struggled to find the truest way to save the country,

544
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,400
Moa Zedong's eyes were opened by the magazine "New Youth."

545
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,560
He started to explore

546
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,520
the ideas of the early New Culture Movement.

547
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,200
During this period,

548
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
he wrote these words in his diary:

549
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,600
In struggling with the sky, is there boundless joy.

550
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,780
In struggling with the earth, is there boundless joy.

551
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
In struggling with the people, is there boundless joy.

552
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,400
Students,
[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

553
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,160
I read
[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

554
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,040
this newly published "Youth Magazine"

555
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,000
and was immediately attracted by the

556
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,120
inaugural address "A Call to Youth" by Mr.Chen Duxiu.
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiang Yu, Nankai School Student]

557
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,160
It was like a bright lamp

558
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,440
that illuminated my mind,

559
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,840
It made me feel like

560
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,240
everything I've thought and learned and done before

561
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
was all for nought.

562
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,560
Therefore, I plan to switch

563
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,960
my oral reading

564
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,640
with this issue of "Youth Magazine"

565
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,560
to share my delight with everyone.

566
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,520
Compariots desiring to leave the age of ignorance,

567
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,800
ashamed of their simple mindedness,

568
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,680
and eager to catch up,

569
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,440
must pay equal attention to scientific knowledge and human rights.

570
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
Our scholars do not know science.

571
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,400
So they follow the Naturalists' School of auspicious signs and five elements.

572
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Confusing the world and cheating the people.

573
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,600
Our farmers do not know science.

574
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,600
So they have no methods for seed selection or insecticide.

575
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,200
Our industrialists do not know science.

576
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,200
So goods lie wasted on the ground,

577
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,600
as we are dependent on foreign countries.

578
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
Our merchants do not know science.

579
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,720
So they only care about short term profits,

580
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,760
without any thought for planning for the future.

581
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,400
Our physicians do not know science.

582
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,000
So they are not acquainted with human anatomy.

583
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,840
The truth

584
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,120
in the universe is boundless.

585
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,440
The fertile realms of science awaiting the trailblazer

586
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,720
are immense!

587
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,040
Youth, take up the task!

588
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,000
[Shanghai]

589
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,640
Strike your little gong.

590
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,000
"Youth Magazine" has been published.

591
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Chinese society has many difficulties.

592
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,840
Mr. Chen Duxiu has shared two prescriptions with the public.

593
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,320
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science

594
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,720
has already come to China.

595
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,320
King of steel, Carnegie.

596
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
That's Carnegie, not Shmarnegie.

597
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,440
Wonderful! Wonderful!

598
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,000
Turns out he was originally just a working boy.

599
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,720
Great!

600
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,800
Hello, excuse me.

601
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,520
Take a look, take a peek.

602
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,720
"Youth Magazine"

603
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science are here.

604
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,600
See how Carnegie fulfilled the American Dream.

605
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,300
How he went from a worker to the king of steel!

606
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,160
Here, take a look.

607
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:11,120
"Youth Magazine" Come, take a look.
Newest edition.

608
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,960
Take a look.

609
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,120
Together?

610
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,280
Thank you, thank you.

611
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,480
"Youth Magazine"

612
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,160
He's from my hometown.

613
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
His name is Hu Shi.

614
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,200
When he was nineteen years old

615
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,680
he went to study abroad in the US,

616
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,480
first at Cornell University to study agricultural science,

617
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
then he switched his major to literature.

618
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
He went to Columbia University this year

619
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,760
to study with that well-known professor, John Dewey,

620
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,000
for a doctorate of philosophy.

621
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,600
It can be said that this child

622
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,320
is proficient in literature, history, and philosophy.

623
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,120
He saw an issue of our "Youth Magazine"
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Cun, New Culture Movement activist]

624
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,360
and was very excited.

625
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,920
He's sent a letter

626
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,820
and wants to write an article regarding the revolution in literature.

627
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,920
So I would like to solicit your opinions.

628
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,080
That's great!

629
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,480
This topic of literary revolution is great.

630
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,560
I really didn't expect

631
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,080
a student who has been overseas for years

632
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,860
to be capable of seeing the purpose of my magazine

633
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
so incisively.

634
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,080
Genius!

635
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,440
A kindred spirit!

636
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,840
Alright, Zhong Fu

637
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,640
A sworn friend!

638
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
That's enough.

639
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,520
Zhong Fu, a young man's letter

640
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
can get you so excited?

641
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Aren't you too ridiculous?

642
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,240
Not by half!

643
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,600
Ideological guidance cannot be idle chit-chat, 

644
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,880
but start from a concrete basis

645
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,400
that focuses on the lives of the masses.

646
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,160
"Literary Revolution: A Tentative Proposal"

647
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,160
If this article is written properly,

648
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,960
it will be a bombshell!

649
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,280
Bai Sha, the younger generation will in time surpass us!

650
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,200
This Hu Shi

651
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,040
is too important for our "Youth Magazine."

652
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,040
Must grab him!

653
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,040
Oh Zhong Fu,

654
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,400
in this time and age,

655
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,640
it's not easy to find a genius

656
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,840
who can catch your eye.

657
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
Though don't get too hung up on it.

658
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,200
This guy is a doctoral student in the United States,

659
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
and a disciple of Professor Dewey.

660
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,840
As if you can grab him just by saying so.

661
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,200
This guy lives in the United States.

662
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Whether he can even come back is an issue.

663
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,400
No, no. This I can guarantee.

664
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,760
He will definitely return to China after completing his studies.

665
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,440
How can one be sure?

666
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
This guy, Hu Shi,

667
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,640
is a filial son.

668
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,360
Before he went abroad to study,

669
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,360
his mother arranged a marriage for him.

670
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
His mother can't wait to get a grandson.

671
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,160
So she writes him letters every few days

672
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,040
telling him to come back after he finishes his studies to get married.

673
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,800
He would not dare to disobey his mother.

674
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,720
This person is really too wonderful.

675
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
His thinking is wonderful.

676
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,600
What?

677
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,340
Grab him!

678
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,040
Grab him as soon as he comes back.

679
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,680
Junman!

680
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,320
Here, let me.

681
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,520
Why is your cough so bad?

682
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,320
You took your medicine?

683
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,120
I did. It's not effective.

684
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,480
It's not effective?

685
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
You have to keep taking it.

686
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,000
How can the medicine work if you don't keep taking it?

687
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,800
I've finished it.

688
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,240
But there were no results.

689
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,320
You've finished it.

690
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,440
Ok, alright.

691
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,760
Don't work any more.

692
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,800
Go rest in the house.

693
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
Let me sit here for a bit.

694
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,800
Get some air.

695
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,160
Then wait. I will go buy medicine.

696
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,040
You don't need to go.

697
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,400
The drawer has long run out of money.

698
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,200
The money you gave me last month is all used up.

699
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,720
It's an old problem.

700
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
It'll pass.

701
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,800
Don't worry. I'm not dying.

702
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,800
Gao Junman!

703
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,360
Don't work anymore!

704
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,600
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

705
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
Go inside and rest.

706
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,600
Wait for me.

707
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,600
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

708
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,120
Can't cook if the firewood's not chopped!

709
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,680
Zhong Fu,

710
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,520
why are you here in such a heavy rain?

711
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,680
Just dropping by.

712
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,680
Pour your own tea if you want.

713
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,600
Those the accounts?

714
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,880
So today,

715
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,400
I ran around to collect the money.

716
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,840
To date, our "Youth Magazine"

717
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,880
has sold 2000 copies in total,

718
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,840
breaking even.

719
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
The principal has basically been recouped.

720
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,040
That's great.

721
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,080
That's a good thing, right?

722
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,320
Mengzou,

723
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,760
My uh...

724
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,480
This issue's payment for uh,

725
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,480
for my editorial.

726
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,640
Is that included in the capital?

727
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm calculating the big accounts.

728
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,320
Haven't had a chance yet to take you into consideration.

729
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,800
Hold on, you have to take me into consideration as well.

730
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
If your capital has been recouped

731
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,240
then shouldn't the payment for my editorial

732
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,920
be given back to me?

733
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,400
Alright, then let me take you into consideration right now.

734
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,440
Let me see,

735
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,040
Your manuscript fee, editorial fee

736
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,920
added together

737
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,840
is 138 silver dollars.

738
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,600
However, you've asked three times for an advance.

739
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
The first time, for 4 silver dollars.

740
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
The second time, also for 4 silver dollars.

741
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,680
The third time, for 10 silver dollars.

742
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,360
18 all together.

743
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,560
138 minus 18 

744
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,560
So you should get

745
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,000
120 silver dollars, correct?

746
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,880
I'll give it to you right now.

747
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,840
Fifty.

748
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,840
One hundred.

749
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,600
One twenty.

750
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600
Take it.

751
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,680
I borrowed money three times.

752
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,600
Two $4 and one $10.

753
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,240
Why don't I have any impression of this?

754
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,320
These matters, you don't need to think over it.

755
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,840
These are the matters I'll look after. 

756
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,040
As for you, great thinker

757
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,560
just unhesitatingly let out your brilliance.

758
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,520
Zhong Fu,

759
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,520
you say, this Yuan Shikai,

760
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,520
his determination to be the emperor

761
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,920
makes the heavens angry and causes people to resent.

762
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,680
This authority, right now also has no time

763
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,120
to deal with the revolutionaries.

764
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,040
As soon as the current political situation starts to ease

765
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,360
this business opportunity, it will come.

766
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,080
I want to seize onto the opportunity, go out and raise capital.

767
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
With your great persona, you will have a lot of acquaintances.

768
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,520
Bring over more people with money to invest.

769
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,040
This magazine of ours, maybe it will resume operations.

770
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,680
Alright. No problem.

771
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,000
You're responsible for finding people, I'll show up personally.

772
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,440
As long as the magazine can be managed well,

773
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,560
whatever you have me do is fine.

774
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,080
Uncle Wang.

775
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,800
You've come back.

776
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,400
Dad.

777
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,800
Why have you come back so early today?

778
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,400
It's raining today, impossible to work.

779
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,040
Mengzou

780
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,600
This... Yannian and Qiaonian doing editing here,

781
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,600
isn't it that they should have pay too?

782
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,920
I gave it to them, Yannian didn't want it.

783
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,680
Speaking about this pay, 

784
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,400
it's made up for in my accommodation fees here.

785
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,320
I want to properly discuss with you,

786
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,720
these two children's matters. 

787
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,920
In the daytime, they are working at the port.

788
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,920
At night, they come over to my place to be editors.

789
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640
And they still need to learn French.

790
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,560
Wouldn't you say these two children are too tired

791
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,880
That is to say, the two brothers living costs right now, 

792
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,160
all depends on the salary from working at the port.

793
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
That's right.

794
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,720
I have also heard, at the port they

795
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,520
extended the working time.

796
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,320
I quietly asked Qiaonian

797
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,720
what's going on?

798
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,040
He said it's for getting the tuition to learn French.

799
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,800
You say, what to do?

800
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,720
This child, right now

801
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,600
when his body is still growing.

802
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,000
If he's like this, wouldn't his body break down?

803
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,640
You say, what to do with this?

804
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,240
Those two, if they didn't want the editing pay,

805
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,960
you should give it me. 

806
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,880
I am his father.

807
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,800
It should be me... Receiving it...

808
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,480
It should be normal too, right?

809
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,680
What! This is...

810
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,440
That's another matter!

811
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,440
Didn't I already tell you?

812
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,360
Yannian had the pay

813
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,680
included it in the accommodation fees here.

814
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,240
You still say your son and you are very similar,

815
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,800
not even a little similar.

816
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,440
He, give him money and he doesn't want it.

817
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,480
You here, keep going on and on with me.

818
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,760
This is 50 silver dollars. 

819
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,320
100 silver dollars.

820
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,240
This is 20.

821
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,200
Dad, what are you giving me so much.. 

822
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,160
Listen to me.

823
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,040
This money, I give it to you two brothers to pay tuition.

824
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,360
Understand?

825
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,720
Quickly go.

826
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,880
Zhong Fu.

827
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,080
You already gave it.

828
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,360
Mengzou.

829
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,960
You say, just now

830
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,360
said something like I borrowed money three times.

831
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,400
$4 twice, $10 once.

832
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,720
When was that?

833
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,480
How come I don't have any impression.

834
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,200
Let me look at the account.

835
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,320
Don't talk about these things with me anymore. 

836
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,320
I'll draw some money for you again,

837
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,560
not for drawing some money for myself.

838
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,040
I'll look at the account. How come I didn't...

839
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,240
Stop there!

840
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,800
Chen Yannian!

841
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,960
This money is to give you two brothers to pay tuition.

842
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,960
Am I wrong?

843
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,960
Don't need it.

844
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,520
Today, you say it to me clearly. 

845
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,640
What is it about me that you are so against? 

846
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,000
You are too greedy.

847
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,880
You want both a family and to love your country.

848
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:03,829
I do want both a family and to love my country.

849
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,120
Is there a contradiction between these two?

850
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
There is a contradiction. 

851
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,320
If you want to love your country, then you must give up the family.

852
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,720
Otherwise, you will only give the family

853
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,040
an even greater harm.

854
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,040
You really feel your assertion has value?

855
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,560
At least, currently, yes.

856
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,280
Good! Then you keep insisting! 

857
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,200
Go! Go!

858
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,680
Yannian. Yannian!

859
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,760
Zhong Fu!

860
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,600
Being older, wants to chat

861
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,640
but it collapses with a single conversation.

862
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:46,759
[Waseda University dormitory, Japan]

863
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,520
Shou Chang

864
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,320
Did you see the announcement at the school's entrance?

865
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,960
The school is known for its long-standing lack of learning.

866
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,640
You have been expelled!

867
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,080
I saw it. This was within my expectations.

868
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,040
I've been struggling for months.

869
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,400
It's done now. I've got a result.

870
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,160
I can completely focus on taking care of the revolution now.

871
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,040
Brother Shouchang

872
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,560
It's completely me who harmed you

873
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,120
At that time, I really shouldn't have insisted on pulling you

874
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,800
to be the editor-in-chief of "Minyi" magazine.

875
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,400
You were originally at the Foreign Students Assocation in Japan

876
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,120
being the head editor in the literature and history committee

877
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,240
were already very busy.

878
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,520
It doesn't have to do with you.

879
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,360
It's I who likes to edit magazines.

880
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
Right now, Yuan Shikai acts an emperor.

881
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,360
The country is already successfully thrown into a complete mess. 

882
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,680
I absolutely can not calm down my heart to read books.

883
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
What plans do you have?

884
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,080
First, wholeheartedly 

885
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,960
edit the first issue of "Minyi" magazine

886
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,800
have it become the rallying cry that denounces Yuan Shikai.

887
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,600
Then, I'll return to the country. Head to the battlefield.

888
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
Listening to you like this, I also can't sit still.

889
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,200
Anyway, I am also graduating soon

890
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,800
When the time comes, I'll return with you.

891
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,240
but returning to the main topic,

892
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,840
if we're really going to the firing line to fire guns and battle.

893
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,440
I don't know if I can do it.

894
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,120
Who says you have to fight Yuan with real weapons?

895
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,160
Chen Duxiu's ideological enlightenment of the youth

896
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
was the same as the Yuan struggle.

897
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,840
Moreover, he did it from the roots.

898
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
It's not bad compared to the results of a firearm.

899
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,560
Shouchang, I heard that his magazine

900
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,880
ran into big trouble.

901
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,280
Already stopped publishing.

902
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,360
I know.

903
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,720
Small trouble. It's almost resolved. 

904
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,040
Just change the publication name, and it's fine.

905
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
Right now, I am in the middle of

906
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,880
writing an article for the relaunch issue.

907
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,680
You are? Can I take a look?

908
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,760
What a great title for "Youth".

909
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,320
This long?

910
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,160
I'll read it to you. You try to feel it.

911
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes, yes.

912
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,400
When the Earth turns white,

913
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,960
we are still in our youth.

914
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,600
We use our youth,

915
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,280
To softly change earth's whiteness.

916
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,240
Although old, yet not old

917
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,000
is the Earth's one day of existence.

918
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,624
That is, our youth exists for one day.

919
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,300
Our youth exists for one day.

920
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,114
That is, the youth of the earth exists for one day.

921
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,360
In 1916,

922
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,920
Li Dazhao wrote his famous article

923
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,120
"Youth", in Japan.

924
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
The article used an uplifting revolutionary spirit

925
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,720
and a scientific approach to humanism

926
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,120
expressing an clear materialistic ideology,

927
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,400
proposing the ideal of rejuvenating China's youth.

928
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,800
Calling young people

929
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,760
to break through the snares of past history,

930
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,600
destroy stereotypical doctrines,

931
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,200
use the spirit of youth to continuously transform oneself,

932
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,400
use the vitality of youth, the ideals of youth

933
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,440
to wake up the old China from the century of dormancy,

934
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,600
and establish a youthful China.

935
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,080
Hurry, hurry, hurry. It's freezing.

936
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,066
[First-rate Xiang hotel, Shanghai]

937
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:07,861
[Wu Zhihui a.k.a. Jing Heng]

938
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Hurry, come warm up in the fire.

939
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,080
Quickly sit, quickly sit. Warm up.

940
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,720
Knowing I came back,

941
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,200
you guys even came to see me. Good!

942
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,120
By contrast, your guys' father

943
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,200
don't know if he doesn't welcome me back.

944
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,920
Or he is scared that I will snatch his profits,

945
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,560
so he's pulling his strong card with me

946
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,880
It's already been so long, and he doesn't come to see me,

947
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,720
he is really worse than a child.

948
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,440
What is Chen Duxiu busy with?

949
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,160
"Youth Magazine" became renowned with other people.

950
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,880
It was sued by others for breach of reputation

951
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,880
and so stopped publishing.

952
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,440
He's been busy with the lawsuit.

953
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,960
Who is so insensitive?

954
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,440
Dare to dispute with the enlightened great master Chen Duxiu?

955
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,200
Isn't this finding trouble by yourself?

956
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,240
Okay, okay. Let's not talk about him now.

957
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,120
How are you guys doing?

958
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,720
Living, isn't it very tough?

959
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,440
We aren't afraid of hardship!

960
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,960
We two have been working while studying.

961
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,240
Living life to the fullest!

962
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,640
Good. Good.

963
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,120
I didn't misjudge you guys.

964
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,200
I'll tell you guys.

965
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,760
I returned this time,

966
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
first is to assist in overthrowing the Lord Protector Yuan,

967
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,400
second is to launch a campaign for a work-study program for those who will stay in France.

968
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Didn't you guys want to go to France?

969
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,080
Let me test you guys.

970
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,400
Nowadays, what is the most popular theory in the West?

971
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,160
Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution!

972
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,000
That's not simple,

973
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,240
who told you this?

974
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,440
I overheard it too

975
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,920
Hunan and Anhui comrades held a meeting.

976
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,800
Chen Duxiu gave everyone

977
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,240
an explanation on the Theory of Evolution all morning

978
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,920
saying that natural selection is an unchanging truth

979
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,720
and is the motivation for human progress

980
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,240
In this, Chen Duxiu is ignorant and narrow-minded.

981
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,960
He only knows the first thing and not the second.

982
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,960
Actually, the popular theory nowadays

983
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,000
is not Darwin's Theory of Evolution,

984
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,000
rather it's Kropotkin's Theory of Mutual Assistance.

985
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,080
Come.

986
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,840
This is some material from France that I specially 

987
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
brought back for you guys.

988
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,920
You guys carefully take a look at it.

989
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,360
I guarantee

990
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,960
as you guys understand it more and more, 

991
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,440
you will for sure deeply fall in love with it.

992
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,240
Take a look, take a look.

993
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,560
March 1916

994
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
amidst the outcry at home and abroad

995
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,040
Yuan Shikai was forced to cancel his autocratic monarchy.

996
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,240
A shameful performance full of a farce to restore an autocratic monarchy

997
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,360
came to a premature end.

998
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,120
Since the Xinhai Revolution, 

999
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,560
due to the fact that in China

1000
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,560
the idea to establish a bourgeois republic

1001
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,760
was out of step with the Chinese situation,

1002
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,040
the old democratic revolution

1003
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
lead by China's bourgeoisie

1004
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
cannot obtain the extensive support of the working class.

1005
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,160
Hitting a wall in all directions. Suffering defeat in every battle.

1006
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,760
A difficult situation.

1007
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,120
Yuan Shikai, who represents the feudal power of China

1008
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,440
was regarded as taking away the achievements of the Xinhai Revolution, and met with contempt after his death.

1009
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,640
Revolutionists who were forced into exile overseas returned to the country one after another

1010
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,440
Li Dazhao

1011
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,840
invited to visit Beijing

1012
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,920
took the post of editor-in-chief of "Morning Bell" newspaper.

1013
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,800
At this time, after the baptism of the anti-Yuan movement

1014
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,840
initially accepting

1015
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,040
the historical materialism point of view, Li Dazhao

1016
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,120
already became a revolutionary full of new ideas.

[Qianmen Street, Beijing]

1018
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,320
Brother. Where is your home?

1019
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,880
Outside Yongdingmen. The pariah.

1020
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,560
Why do you say this?

1021
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,360
Those who pull carts, wield skill in trade

1022
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,640
have shaved heads, are pig butchers, coffin carriers,

1023
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,880
all live over there.

1024
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,160
Then how is getting by in life right now for you guys?

1025
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,320
Impossible to get by. Everyone's suffering until they can't take it anymore.

1026
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,240
According to the older generations' saying,

1027
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,920
we have never gone through such sullen days.
