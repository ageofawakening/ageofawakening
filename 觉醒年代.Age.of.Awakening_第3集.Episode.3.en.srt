[Episode Three]

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,360
I invited you here today

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,640
because I want to repair my image in your minds.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,080
This is the batch that just came out.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,760
Please enjoy.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
That's wonderful!

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,080
Wait, wait, wait!

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,680
It's not finished, it's not finished!

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,560
I can't write this for nothing.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,920
It has to be commissioned.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,920
Brother Zhong Fu.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,480
Your writing is in a class of its own.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,720
It's hard to find a good writer.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,240
As long as the gentleman is willing to write for us,

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,360
it's not a problem.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,160
Okay, then I won't charge more.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,560
Two hundred silver dollars per print.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,400
Don't worry, no problem!

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,320
Good!

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,862
Don't!

22
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:54,825
Don't rush!

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
We're not done yet.

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,320
I'd like to write more than one.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
One per month.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,400
What do you think?

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,080
One per month...

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,080
Yes, monthly.

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
No, it's a bit strange, isn't it?

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,703

Aiyo... yoyoyo...

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,160
This is rare.

34
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,640
One per month!

35
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,480
I've been with Zhongfu for so many years

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that I don't even have one of his calligraphies in my hand.

37
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,840
Naturally.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,640
What about you?

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll take it if you won't.

40
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,760
Brother Mengzou, Brother Zhong Fu.

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,160
You seem to have ulterior motives.

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,920
Right!

43
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,480
One per month, 200 per print.

44
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,427
We'll take it!

45
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:35,200
Take it!

46
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Good, Brother Menzou, write up the contract.

47
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,920

But where is the money?

59
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
Cut quickly!

What are you two doing in the house?

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,080
Is it hot?

63
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,720
Come and eat watermelon. Eat watermelon.

64
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,840
Come on, it's sweet. Come on, come on.

65

What's this?

77
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,560
It's for Zimei.

78

79

81

How's it going? What's the situation in Shanghai?

108
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
The anti-Yuan movement has taken root in people's hearts,

109
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
it is unstoppable.

110
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
It's just that the Yuan forces' repressive tactics

111
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
are getting more and more brutal.

112
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,200
Yes, there were many deaths everywhere.

It's not that I'm efficient,

122
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
it's that we've all been so desperate for so long

123
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,120
that we're going crazy.

124
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,680
It's a great opportunity to be active!

125
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000

Alright.

129
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,560
The situation is now in our favour.

130
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,440
The world powers are at war in Europe

131
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,760
and can't be bothered with our China.

by increasing suppression of anti-Yuan activists.

135
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,120
But such a high-handed policy

136
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,520
has instead given us

137
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,960
a lot of public support.

138
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Thus Mr. Zhongshan and General Huang Xing

139
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,200
asked us to take active action

140
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
to protect our country,

141
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,480
as soon as the time is right,

Whenever there is an incident in Yunnan,

149
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480

Nice work!

152
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,320
Why do I get the impression

153
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
that Zhong Fu is in charge of the army?

154
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
It's only been three days, you seem different than before.

155
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
I've heard you've got something big.

156
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Tell us about it.

157
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,040
I can't continue fighting and quarrelling forever.

158
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm still doing my old job, writing.

159
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,320
For the past two months, I and Baisha have been staying at home

160
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
running a magazine called "Youth Magazine".

161
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,080
The goal was to promote a new culture,

162
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
to create a new generation of young people

163
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,120
with the most advanced ideas

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
and theories in the world,

165
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,480
in order to replace the one that has ruled China for thousands of years:

166
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,080
the Three Principles of Confucianism.

167
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
Under the banner of science and democracy,

168
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
a new generation of youth will be reinvented.

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,280
This is a sketch of the inaugural issue.

170
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Gentlemen, share your thoughts.

171
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,880
Brother Zhong Fu,

172
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
why is there a foreigner on this cover?

173
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,960
Who is this?

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
Carnegie!

175
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,920
The steel king and philanthropist.

176
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
He is Scottish.

177
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
At the age of eleven, he moved to America

178
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
and worked in a textile factory to make ends meet.

179
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,520
Firing boilers,

180
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
working as a courrier...

181
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,160
Then, through his own ingenuity and hard work,

182
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,960
established his own company

183
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,640
alongside Rockefeller and Morgan

184
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,680
creating a steel empire...

185
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,080
It became one of the three giants of the American economy.

186
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,280
The reason I put Carnegie

187
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,400
as the cover of our inaugural issue

188
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,400
is that we want to tell

189
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
the children of China who are still suffering

190
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,760
that the way of the world is left to the people of this world

191
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
and where there is a will, there is a way.

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,960
Zhong Fu, you promote new cultures and new ideas.

193
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
I'm all for it.

194
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,720
But if you reject Confucianism in its entirety,

195
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
I cannot accept.

196
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,920
Brother Xing Yan, not all of it.

197
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,480
Listen to me carefully

198
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,560
and in detail.

199
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,840
Let's go.

200
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,451
[Aurora University auditorium, Shanghai]

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Some people say that you, Chen Duxiu, started a magazine

202
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,040
to awaken the nation's political 

203
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
and ethical consciousness.

204
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,120
So what is this awakening?

205
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
As everyone knows,

206
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,560
after Lin Zexu banned opium,

207
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
the British invaded China.

208
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
With their strong ships and powerful guns,

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
we were defeated.

210
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,320
So some people suggested

211
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,240
that we should learn from the barbarians to control them.

212
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,960
This is the first awakening.

213
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,600
Knowing that you are not as good as others

214
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,240
and the need to learn from them.

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,000
Later on, some people also further realized

216
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,040
that we are not only inferior in skills

217
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,080
but also in country.

218
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,480
The foreigners had a more advanced system than we did,

219
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,320
so they came up with the Hundred Days' Reform and the New Deal of the late Qing Dynasty.

220
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,680
Until the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial system

221
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,920
and established a republic.

222
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,840
This is the second awakening.

223
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,480
But what about the establishment of the Republic?

224
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
The foreigners are still bullying us.

225
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,920
The people still don't have enough to eat.

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,760
Here's why.

227
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,480
It's not just that we're not as good as others,

228
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,960
with a system not as good as theirs.

229
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,400
The most fundamental thing

230
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,520
is our ideological and moral philosophy.

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,400
which is less advanced than others.

232
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,080
That's why I say that all enlightenment

233
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
is ultimately the enlightenment of the mind

234
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,160
and the awareness of moral philosophy.

235
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
This is the final awakening.

236
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
In the end, it's all about human awareness.

237
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,840
This final awakening is to change our minds

238
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,240
to find the most advanced ideas in the world

239
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,960
to arm our people

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,800
to shape a new generation of youth

241
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,320
to create a new nation!

242
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes! Yes! Yes!

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
For the new youth in contemporary China,

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
I think there should be six criteria.

245
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
First, one must be independent, not servile.

246
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,520
Second, one must be progressive, not conservative.

247
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,040
Third, one must be aggressive, not reclusive.

248
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,040
Fourth, one must be international, not isolated.

249
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,200
Fifth, one must be practical, not illusory.

250
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,840
Sixth, one must be scientific, not imaginary.

251
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
The six criteria are,

252
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,560
in a nutshell, that science and democracy

253
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,520
should create a new generation of young people,

254
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
and the only way to do this is to use both science and democracy.

255
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,520
Science and democracy are the criteria

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,840
by which politics, law, ethics, academia,

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
social customs 

258
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,400
and the daily lives of people

259
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
are judged.

260
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,080
Anything that is contrary to science and democracy,

261
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,920
even if it is the legacy of our ancestors,

262
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,800
the teachings of our sages

263
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
and the veneration of society

264
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
is not worth promoting.

265
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,600
Yes! Yes! Yes!

266
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,120
Science and democracy are the sunrise,

267
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
but today

268
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,960
the country is a mouldy, rotten

269
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,560

271
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,200
How about letting the sun of science and democracy

272
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,880
shine on the house?

273
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,240
In the past we used the simplest method,

274
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,960
knocking down old houses.

275
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,640
But you knocked down the house!

276
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,640
The mould, the sores, the glue are still hidden inside.

What grows is still rotten and dirty.

278
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,440
So, China must be strong.

279

but more importantly,

My opinion is that

288
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,080
we should start with the daily life

289
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,760

290
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,520

and write words that everyone can read.

294
