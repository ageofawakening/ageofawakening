00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,524
[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:07,559
[Episode Seven]

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,800
The topic of today's meeting is

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,120
reforming Peking University's teaching work.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,040
This subject,

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,520
five years prior, when I was Minister of Education,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,800
is what I brought up. 

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,280
Today, we can truly put it into practice.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
This shows the difficulty of reform.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,680
In the face of such difficult reforms,

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,160
there must be a condition:

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
that is unity.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,040
The first step of reform

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,360
is to set up a board of trustees.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
This board of trustees

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
is composed of the president and deans of various discplines

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,160
as well as professors represented by trustees.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,800
For every five professors in the school,

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,760
one trustee must be elected.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
The president is the chief trustee,

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,520
and all major school matters

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,360
must be examined and approved by the board of trustees,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,720
such as the development of various rules and regulations,

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,240
determining the abolition and establishment of disciplines

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,480
or of academic titles of professors,

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,280
the school budget, and so on.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
All have to go through the university board of trustees.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,120
Therefore, we obligate every professor of each discipline

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
to be reappointed.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
To bring the best talents,

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,240
including foreign.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
We must all accept into Peking University

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
and abolish those unqualified professors,

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,760
including foreign professors.

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,760
This task is very complicated.

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,480
So we should start with liberal arts.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
May Mr. Zhongfu put all his energy into this area

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,680
and come up with a detailed plan as soon as possible.

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,000
Hand it over to the school board of trustees for discussion and approval.

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,280
Understood.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,160
Good.

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,400
That's all for today's meeting.

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,040
Good.

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,120
Professor Gu.

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,000
This is over, too.

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
The two of us can spar in the school grounds on campus.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,760
The others can attend.

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
Please.

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,240
Brother Zhongfu, please stay.

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
I want to talk to you.

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
Let's sit down and talk.

52
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,880
Brother Zhongfu is a researcher of Chinese history.

53
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:47,451
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,960
Do you know

55
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,960
which era of Chinese history

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,600
it reminds me of at the moment?

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,480
Hot.

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
The Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period before Qin dynasty.

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,880
What was the situation of the era at that time?

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
The Western Zhou dynasty destroyed rites and music.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
At the time, no one knew where to go from there.

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,259
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,200
Everyone was looking for a way out.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
But the key point

65
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,280
is that in that period,

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,240
there was no unified royal authority,

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,880
so all kinds of learning came out.

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
You say yours, I'll say mine.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
So it's a pleasure to fight it out.

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,680
Right.

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,240
The Hundred Schools of Thought. How lively.

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
Therefore, culture is the forerunner of politics.

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,160
Brother Zhongfu, I don't know if you've noticed

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,040
the period we are in now is very similar to that of the pre-Qin.

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
No matter what era the future develops into, 

76
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
it will eventually be guided by our

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,240
present advocacy of new culture.

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
It is also based on the break with the old culture.

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,051
No.

80
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:11,246
No.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
I disagree with you.

82
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,520
Culture is not separable.

83
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,280
New culture can only

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
grow in the swaddling clothes of the old culture.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,800
And as for old culture, it's only sublation and innovation.

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,760
Academic research cannot be uniform.

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
We must encourage and support a Hundred Schools of Thought.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
What Mister means is

89
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,760
Peking University should continue to hire

90
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
these old-fashioned die-hard professors.

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,360
Yes.

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
But the new culture

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
is grass that just broke through the soil.

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
How can you stand

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
the crazy trampling of the old forces?

96
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
What's wrong?

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,920
Are you, Chen Duxiu, not confident?

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
What did you tell me yesterday?

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
I mean, I want to fight

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
but I really don't want to

101
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,400
associate with these stubborn old-fashioned professors

102
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
all day long.

103
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Look at this Gu Hongming.

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
The moment I arrived, I was given a show of strength.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
Of course I'm going to spar with him on the school grounds.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,560
Brother Zhongfu.

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
As the Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University,

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
you can't be unable to tolerate people.

109
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
You know, people and culture are the most complicated.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
In today's chaotic era,

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,280
in fact, everyone is looking for a way out for the country,

112
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,840
but the thinking is different.

113
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,680
You take for example Gu Hongming.

114
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
Although some people say that he is a die-hard royalist,

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
he is also full of justice akin to the Spring and Autumn period,

116
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,280
but we have to admit

117
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,040
Gu Hongming's exposition and criticism of Western culture

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,040
is still of great positive significance.

119
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,720
People like you and I who have been abroad for many years

120
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
should feel the same way.

121
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,440
Right?

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,080
Master Cai's words, is of great benefit to me.

123
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,360
You are flattering me.

124
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
In addition to you and I,

125
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,560
This Mr. Liu Shipei, a fellow of the Yuewang Association,
(democratic revolutionary group founded in 1905 by Chen Duxiu and Bo Wenwei)

126
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,560
he recently sent me a letter.

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
This person...

128
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,960
He is one of the famous Six Chuan Gentlemen
(pro-Yuan monarchist organisation)

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
and also wrote to Yuan Shikai

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,240
"On Restoring the Ancient Ways to the Country under the Monarch".

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,320
What did he say in his letter sent to me?

132
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,000
First, it refutes

133
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Hu Shi's "On Literary Improvement".

134
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,920
Second,

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,800
he actively asked to teach at Peking University.

136
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
This Liu Shipei

137
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
has done a lot of foolish things.

138
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
But he is a scholar.

139
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,880
Everything he did was for the sake of his livelihood.

140
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,280
Brother Zhongfu.

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
My dream

142
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
is for Peking University to become

143
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
a great academic stage with outstanding talents,

144
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,400
because only in this way

145
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,120
can we breed a healthy new culture.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,600
I asked Brother Zhongfu to come to Peking University as the Dean of Liberal Arts.

147
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
That is the origin of all.

148
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
Brother Jiemin.

149
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,560
Now I miss it very much.

150
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,280
The times we were making bombs together,

151
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,720
at least that time,

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
you didn't talk in circles.

153
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,880
I see.

154
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,120
You mean not only to keep Gu Hongming

155
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,400
and let me fight with him,

156
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,200
but also to bring the old-fashioned Liu Shipei

157
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
to Peking University, right?

158
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
I carefully understand Master Cai's ingenuity.

159
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
I have a lot to live up to.

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhongfu.

161
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,960
Students, the fate of the literary revolution

162
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
has not been brewing for a day.

163
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,886
[Gu Hongming, styled Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

164
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,640
The first to raise the banner of righteousness

165
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
was my friend Hu Shi,

166
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,640
willing to brave the enemies of the national scholars,

167
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
to raise the banner of the cultural revolutionary army

168
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
Consider my friend's solidarity.

169
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,560
The banner is written with

170
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
the three great doctrines of our revolutionary army.

171
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,440
I say, overthrow the ornate, aristocratic literature,

172
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,360
build a simple, lyrical, national literature.

173
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,960
I say, overthrow the stale, extravagant, classical literature,

174
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,360
build a fresh, honest, realistic literature.

175
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,200
I say, overthrow the intricate, obscure, pastoral literature,

176
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
build a clear, popular, social literature.

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,080
Aye! Aye! Aye!

178
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,880
Aye!

179
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,560
Mr. Chen has said it well!

180
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Aye! Aye! Aye!

181
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,440
Aye!

182
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,520
Don't move. Don't move.

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
Everyone's in class.

184

Don't move. Don't move.

185
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:12,344
Don't move. Don't move.

186
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,200
Everyone's in class.

187
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,720
Almost there. Almost there. Almost there.

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,880
How long can you go for?

189
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,440
Mister is coming!

190
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
Mister is coming! Mister is coming!

191
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,520
Enough. Enough. Enough.

192
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,840
Rise.

193
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,760
Bow.

194
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
Greetings, sir.

195
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,414
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Professor at Peking University]

196
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,680
Greetings, students. Sit.

197
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,880
Fellow students,

198
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,400
today let's all enjoy this strange piece of writing.

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,400
Recently in America,

200
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,960
there was an unmatured youngster named Hu Shi

201
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,080
who wrote several poems in vernacular Chinese.

202
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,960
Unexpectedly, it was published in the famous

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
"New Youth" magazine

204
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,440
and unexpectedly even won some applause.

205
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
It's ridiculous!

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,240
I've read this article.

207
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,960
It's like seeing a bunch of cattle manure. 

208
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,960
Causes one to be unable to swallow

209
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
and think like a barn fly.

210
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
Making people thin and sleepless.

211
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Therefore, from now on,

212
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
I will make a rule.

213
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
That is, before class every day,

214
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,520
I will spend twenty minutes

215
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,840
criticizing this writing in vernacular, free verse in vernacular,

216
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,440
bit by bit until it falls over, rotten and stinking.

217
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,680
Mr. Jigang.

218
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,720
If you don't want the "New Youth"

219
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
that you threw on the ground.

220
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
Can I pick it up?

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
You can consider it a bargain.

222
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,560
Wait, wait.

223
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,040
Put it back.

224
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
Didn't you not want it?

225
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,480
Pick it up.

226
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,520
Mister can disagree with the ideas in the book,

227
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,120
but don't throw the book away.

228
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,840
What ideas?

229
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,520
It's all nonsense!

230
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,320
I'm going to throw it a hundred times, a thousand times!

231
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,796
Pick it up.

232
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:27,924
Pick it up!

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Sir, let me pick it up for you.

234
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,720
Sir.

235
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,880
However many times you throw it

236
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,480
is however many times I will help you to pick it up.

237
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,440
I've taken on the task.

238
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,040
Go back!

239
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,360
Of course.

240
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,320
Sir!

241
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
If you throw it again, I'll also pick it up for you.

242
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,680
Students! Pick it up or not?

243
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,480
Pick it up!

244
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,120
Quiet!

245
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,280
Sit down.

246
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920
Students, let's get back on topic.

247
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,160
Writing poems in vernacular Chinese.

248
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,600
What a joke.

249
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,240
This is just lunatic ravings!

250
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
Self-delusions!

251
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,160
What is poetry?

252
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,920
The essentials of poetry. What is the essence of poetry?

253
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
To sum it up in one word,

254
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
it is refinement.

255
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,320
What is vernacular?

256
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,400
It can also be summed up in one word,

257
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
it is vulgar.

258
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,640
One is refined, one is vulgar.

259
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
One is holy, one is grotesque.

260
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
Can we mentioned these in the same breath?

261
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,840
Can we pass off fish eyes as pearls?

262
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
Sir.

263
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
I think literature should be both refined and popular.

264
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Old-style poetry and vernacular poetry go hand in hand.

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Wouldn't free development be better?

266
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Confusion!

267
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,160
Poetry is poetry, prose is prose, and speech is speech.

268
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,640
If you want to represent everything in vernacular,

269
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,640
why do you need poetry?

270
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160
What is the point of Peking University?

271
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
Do you still need to travel thousands of miles

272
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
from Hunan to Beijing to go to school?

273
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,440
Sir.

274
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760
Vernacular poetry is really popular now.

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,560
Female students in normal universities

276
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320
keep Mr. Shizhi's poems in their hands every day,

277
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,838
[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhonghao, Student at Peking University]

278
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
and they organize vernacular poetry readings.

279
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,640
Exactly.

280
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,120
Right.

281
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,640
Our Peking University student union

282
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400
is also preparing for a poetry recital.

283
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,000
Many professors have come to attend.

284
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
such as Professor Chen Duxiu,

285
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,280
Professor Qian Xuantong,

286
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,720
and Professor Shen Yinmo.

287
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,760
They all come to attend.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,640
Right!

289
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
They all want to come!

290
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,720
Yeah! Yeah!

291
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Quiet!

292
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
Deng Zhongxia, I ask you.

293
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Whose student are you?

294
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480
Are you my, Huang Kan's, protege?

295
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,120
Or that Chen Duxiu's filial son and grandson?

296
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
Sir.

297
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,280
I love my teacher,

298
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,640
I love the truth more.

299
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Well, since you're talking about the truth.

300
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
Then I'll tell you what truth is.

301
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080
What the teacher says is truth.

302
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
Dignity is truth.

303
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
You are arguing irrationally.

304
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680
Guo Xingang, what did you say there?

305
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,200
He said you argue irrationally!

306
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,320
Quiet!

307
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,760
Guo Xingang, Deng Zhongxia.

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
You two ignore discipline.

309
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Gathering people to make trouble and scold the teacher.

310
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,920
Outrageous!

311
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,560
Both of you, get lost.

312
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,520
Get lost!

313
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,240
Get lost! Get lost! Get lost!

314
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,200
Quiet!

315
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,000
A wall of dirty soil cannot be plastered over.

316
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,640
Let's go, let's get lost.

317
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,160
Good. Students, let's continue our class.

318
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
Today's lecture is on "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons".

319
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,680
Open your textbooks.

320
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,320
Gentlemen, students,

321
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,000
let's begin our meeting.

322
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,280
Liberal arts professor Huang Kan has submitted a complaint in writing to Mr. Cai

323
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,080
regarding the students Deng Zhongxia and Guo Xingang

324
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,520
for disrupting classroom order,

325
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
insulting the teacher, and deviating from Confucian doctrine,

326
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,920
and requests the appropriate disciplinary actions be taken.

327
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,200
Mister Cai has instructed the school to lead an investigation

328
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,560
and ascertain the facts of the matter,

329
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,560
as well as propose suggestions on how to handle it.

330
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
For the sake of prudence,

331
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,120
Mr. Cai is personally attending this meeting.

332
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
Professor Huang Kan is invited to begin the litigations.

333
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,600
Mr. Wu just now misspoke.

334
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,000
This can't be called a lawsuit.

335
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,840
We are here to have a discussion today,

336
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,320
to express our own opinions.

337
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,480
Mr. Huang Kan is invited to express his opinion.

338
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,400
Peking University has always respected the dignity of the teaching profession.

339
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,720
It is a law-abiding school with rules.

340
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,920
But recently,

341
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,360
the so-called New Culture school of thought has enticed

342
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,040
a section of students to be confused in their thinking and lacking in their discipline.

343
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,560
To the point of openly stirring up trouble in class,

344
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
and insulting their teachers.

345
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
It is truly preposterous.

346
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,520
If this can be tolerated, what cannot?

347
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,160
The culprits Guo Xingang and Deng Zhongxia

348
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,200
must be disciplined by the school as a warning to others.

349
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,520
What?

350
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,440
Guo Xingang and Deng Zhongxia...

351
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,280
Hurling abuse at teachers?

352
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,080
Really!

353
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,040
What about the dignity of the teaching profession?

354
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
Quiet down, everyone.

355
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,640
Everyone, quiet. Everyone, quiet down.

356
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
Be quiet, everyone.

357
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,200
The student Deng Zhongxia is invited to address the litigations against him.

358
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,160
No, not litigations.

359
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
To present his side of the argument.

360
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,360
You may speak.

361
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,440
Honoured teachers, gentlemen.

362
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,840
We didn't disrupt classroom conduct.

363
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
We merely didn't entirely agree

364
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,560
with Professor Huang Kan's viewpoint on vernacular Chinese verse,

365
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
and his attitude in the classroom

366
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,840
towards "New Youth" magazine.

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,840
In the classroom we entered into some discussion

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,800
and debate.

369
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,200
I believe

370
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
this should be under the purview of academic freedom.

371
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,440
And not "hurling abuse at the teacher."

372
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,560
Deng Zhongxia,

373
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,080
how can you lie?

374
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
Why don't you tell the truth?

375
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
I testify that Guo Xingang

376
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,880
truly did insult Professor Huang Kan, using specious arguments and sophistry.

377
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,720
We all saw it.

378
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,520
Yes!

379
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,320
We saw it all.

380
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,880
Gentlemen,

381
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
Professor Huang Kan personally attacked

382
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,600
"New Youth" and vernacular poetry in class.

383
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,680
He said "New Youth" was fly-covered cow dung

384
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
and that the writers of vernacular Chinese were idiots.

385
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
But also that his words were the truth,

386
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,800
unquestionably so.

387
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
Is this not preposterous sophistry?

388
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
It is! It is!

389
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,920
Quiet, everyone.

390
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
Quiet, everyone. Quiet.

391
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,160
Quiet, everyone.

392
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,680
Dean Chen, this is an affair of the liberal arts department.

393
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,200
Please state your thoughts.

394
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,760
The origin of this has to do with vernacular writing

395
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,840
and "New Youth" magazine.

396
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
I am heavily implicated in this matter

397
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,120
and am in fact the biggest idiot, according to Professor Wang Kan.

398
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,520
Vernacular speech belongs to those who are idiots

399
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
so as an idiot I better remain silent

400
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
and not speak any idiocies.

401
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,680
Gentlemen,

402
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it is very clear to me what the whole story is.

403
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
Who is right and who is wrong is already self evident.

404
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
In my opinion, the party subjected to disciplinary action

405
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
should not be a few students who dare to presevere with the truth

406
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,920
but rather the one who used the classroom to publicly vent their personal spite.

407
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
The thief who cries thief, Professor Huang Kan.

408
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,600
Huang Kan was vulgar in his speech,

409
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
absurd in his conduct

410
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
and falls far short of Peking University's motto

411
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,280
and Master Cai's objectives for our school.

412
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
Behaviour simply not deserving of being called a teacher.

413
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,960
This kind of person should be cleared out of Peking University.

414
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,440
Right!

415
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,320
Does everyone agree?

416
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,120
I agree!

417
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,840
Cleared out of Peking University!

418
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,280
We shouldn't want this kind of professor!

419
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,680
Exactly!

420
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,640
Stop your hubbub.

421
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,680
You shut up!

422
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,800
Mr. Qian Xuantong, you were too harsh.

423
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
Huang Jigang acted in the interest of the public good,

424
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,560
to uphold our national culture and refute heresies.

425
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,320
It is not a crime.

426
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,400
Completely unreasonable remarks!

427
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,449
[Shen Yinmo, Professor at Peking University]

428
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
In that case, is it a crime

429
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,320
for students to support new culture,

430
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,560
to take a stand on a matter of principle?

431
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,600
Invalid!

432
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,160
Valid!

433
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
Evil heresies!

434
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,240
It is right and proper to support new culture.

435
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,280
Everyone, please sit down. Please sit down.

436
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Let's hear what Mr. Cai has to say.

437
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,560
Today, attending this...

438
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
this discussion forum,

439
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,800
I had not planned to speak.

440
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
But I am moved by everyone's

441
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
fierce and frank participation just now,

442
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,120
so I will say a few words.

443
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,440
To speak bluntly,

444
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200
I think this discussion forum is very good.

445
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,880
To discuss problems freely when they arise, and collect suggestions.

446
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,920
This, in itself,

447
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
is an aspect of our reform measures at Peking University.

448
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,240
What everyone was just discussing

449
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,800
is a question of the school's rules and regulations.

450
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
We do have customs at Peking University.

451
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
In my opinion, Peking University's most important custom

452
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,360
is scientific democracy, inclusive, in all its forms.

453
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,080
What is the premise of scientific democracy?

454
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
It is equality.

455
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
Everyone is equal before the truth.

456
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,520
Not to mention teachers and students.

457
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,760
Inclusive, in all its forms.

458
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,040
That refers to everyone

459
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,920
being able to express their academic opinions.

460
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,680
To hold forth to their heart's content.

461
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,640
This should be our school tradition at Peking University.

462
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,160
I believe discussions like today's

463
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
will occur often at Peking University in the future.

464
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,720
I also hope this kind of discussion forum,

465
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,800
even if it is a bit fierce,

466
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,880
as long as it is useful for teaching,

467
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
the more there are, the merrier.

468
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,520
Well said!

469
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,568
[Spring, 1917]

470
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
Slow down, don't fall.

471
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
Don't let the two of them trip.

472
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
These days, once things are looking up, time just flies by.

473
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
Three months have passed in the blink of an eye.

474
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,600
I thought these three months were quite long.

475
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,840
People are always rushing to argue with me.

476
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,400
Trembling with fear, walking on thin ice.

477
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Oh, please.

478
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,880
It takes two to tango.

479
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
My wife knows me.

480
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,400
Wife, take it easy.

481
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,760
So busy with this and that as soon as you get here.

482
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,080
Can't you take a little break?

483
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,480
If I take a break,

484
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,240
when will this house get tidied?

485
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,960
Wife,

486
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,800
come, rest a while.

487
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,840
Drink some tea.

488
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,920
Set aside your job. I can do it too.

489
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
You do it?

490
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
You only know how to flap your lips.

491
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,360
Why don't you just save me some trouble.

492
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,360
The more you help, the more fuss.

493
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,880
I feel winter in Beijing

494
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,240
is more comfortable than in Shanghai.

495
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
With a fire, it's warmer inside than outside.

496
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
In Shanghai, during winter,

497
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,840
it's even colder inside than outside.

498
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,040
Yannian got several patches of frostbite on his feet.

499
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,880
How come?

500
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,400
From setting up those stall outside.

501
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,400
Has medicine been applied?

502
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,080
It's been applied.

503
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,840
But he won't listen to my advice.

504
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,280
Still insists on setting up the stalls.

505
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,720
Let me tell you something interesting.

506
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,040
Did you know, after you left,

507
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,680
Yannian suddenly came to visit one day.

508
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,040
To apologize to me.

509
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,240
Said that I was so concerned about them before,

510
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,160
helped them so much,

511
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,320
that he never expressed any gratitude towards me,

512
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,080
and that it was inappropriate of him.

513
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,000
And then he told me to stop worrying.

514
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,560
He can take care of himself now.

515
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,600
No more false bravado like before.

516
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,880
No more false bravado.

517
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,520
Setting up stalls even with frostbitten feet.

518
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,960
That's not false bravado?

519
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,240
That's enough.

520
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,240
He's a child after all.

521
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,560
It's already pretty good that he's this thoughtful.

522
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,480
He told me a great deal that day.

523
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,760
I feel,

524
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
he's truly grown-up a lot more compared to before.

525
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
But, right now he really enamoured with Wu Zhihui,

526
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,360
fascinated by his anarchism.

527
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
He's determined to do a work-study program in France.

528
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,600
Along with Qiaonian, he's even living at school now.

529
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,560
But they're still editors at "New Youth"

530
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,440
helping with publishing.

531
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,560
Wang Mengzou signed a contract with the two of them.

532
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
Each according to their work.

533
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,280
So they've figured out both school and life for themselves.

534
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,720
You don't need to worry.

535
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,160
It's not that easy to go to France for work-study.

536
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,360
France is fighting a war.

537
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
Don't know when it's going to end.

538
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,040
The two of them can't stay

539
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,480
in that French evening class forever.

540
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,720
Before, I wanted them to learn self-discipline.

541
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,520
Now it seems like

542
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
it would be more suitable for them to come to Beijing.

543
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,760
I heard Wu Zhihui say

544
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,840
that he is planning,

545
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,840
with Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng,

546
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,320
to establish a Sino-French university in France.

547
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,840
If that is successful,

548
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
then those two kids would have a way out.

549
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,720
Can't just follow whatever Wu Zhihui says.

550
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,280
That guy looks rough, but he's actually quite shrewd.

551
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,720
Kind face, cruel heart.

552
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
Hard to figure him out.

553
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,200
Yannian shouldn't get too close to him.

554
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,480
It's no good.

555
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I have to write him a letter. Advise him.

556
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,381
You're writing a letter?

557
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,720
You write.

558
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,160
I dictate. You write.

559
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
And go to the pharmacy.

560
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,080
Buy him a few boxes of tiger balm.

561
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,280
Send it together.

562
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,800
That's better.

563
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,080
Brother Zhongfu!

564
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,920
At the ceramic glaze factory

565
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
we found this old thing for sister-in-law.

566
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Careful, careful.

567
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
This must be sister-in-law.
[Li Dazhao, styled Shou Chang, editor of Tiger Daily]

568
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,360
Let me make some introductions.

569
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,320
Li Dazhao,

570
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,560
gifted scholar from Waseda University

571
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
Now, with Mr. Zhang Shizhao,

572
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,800
editors of "Tiger"

573
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,160
and also co-editor

574
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,880
of our "New Youth."

575
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,480
Hello.

576
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,680
Zhao Shiyan,

577
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,360
student at Beijing Normal University's affiliated middle school,
[styled Qin Sheng]

578
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,400
disciple of Shou Chang,

579
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,600
and an alumnus from your school.

580
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,320
Mrs. Chen.

581
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
Hello, Shiyan.

582
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
Guo Xingang, Bai Lan.

583
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
I met them in Japan.

584
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,960
Hello, Mrs. Chen.

585
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,840
Hello.

586
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,560
Sister-in-law, take a look at this. Do you like it?

587
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,880
It's too wonderful. Such a wonderful thing.

588
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,080
Where should it be placed?

589
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,720
Thanks.

590
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,640
How about in the bedroom?

591
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,440
Great.

592
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,320
That room, there.

593
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:42,960
Shiyan,

594
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,680
help move it in.

595
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,000
Sure.

596
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,280
Thank you.

597
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,720
It's so nice.

598
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,840
Thought you'd have need for it.

599
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
Shou Chang, it's an honour to meet you at last.

600
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,880
You article "New Youth," is deeply moving.

601
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,200
I often read it aloud when I'm by myself.

602
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,480
I really liked it.

603
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,240
Sister-in-law, you are too generous with your praise.

604
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,760
I've actually read your poetry before.

605
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Graceful and subdued like Li Qingzhao, heartbreaking.
[southen Song dynasty female poet]

606
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,840
What poetry?

607
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
That was just made up nonsense and venting.

608
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,280
Let's first have a seat.

609
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,040
After sitting down, you two can continue to flatter each other.

610
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,840
How's that?

611
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,280
Really!

612
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,840
Zhimei, Henian,

613
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
come and see Mr. Dazhao.

614
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,000
Hello, Mr. Dazhao.

615
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
Hello, you two darlings.

616
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,480
They look like you.

617
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,040
Take this, play over there.

618
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,560
You two sit.

619
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:24,960
Alright.

620
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,560
Here, Shou Chang, sit.

621
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,200
Alright.

622
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Sister-in-law,

623
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,720
now that you're here, I'm finally liberated.

624
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,000
What do you mean by that?

625
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,720
What do I mean by that?

626
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,920
This guy of yours,

627
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,920
mooching off of me every day after he got to Beijing.

628
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,280
It's one thing to mooch,

629
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,960
but he even disdained my cooking, saying it's inferior to yours.

630
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,440
Left me both mentally and physically exhausted.

631
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,080
What I've been eating these last three months has been pitiful.

632
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,200
You see!

633
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,480
I understand.

634
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,160
From now on Mr. Shou Chang,

635
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,520
you must come to eat at our home often.

636
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,240
You have to mooch back all the food he mooched from you!

637
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,760
What are we eating today?

638
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,240
Shou Chang,

639
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
you've been in Beijing for about a year now.

640
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,760
You should move your family here.

641
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,960
That's right.

642
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,720
Mr. Shou Chang is so valiant.

643
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
You must make a great couple.

644
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,000
A marriage of mutual respect.

645
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,640
Sister-in-law, you didn't know this.

646
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
My wife and I were an arranged child marriage.

647
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
When I was ten, my family was short of womenfolk.

648
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,920
So I was married off.

649
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,760
My wife is six years older than me,

650
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,640
and can't read very many characters. She's a genuine village girl.

651
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
But we are very fond of each other,

652
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,120
and have had four children together.

653
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,040
Two of them died young.

654
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,240
Mr. Shou Chang is of noble character and very admirable.

655
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,520
No matter what, you need to settle down your family.

656
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
Why don't you, sooner rather than later,

657
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,520
move your wife and children to Beijing.

658
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,440
I've actually had this thought.

659
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,680
But the situation in Beijing right now is unstable.

660
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,040
Incessant fighting between warlords.

661
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,880
Let's wait and see.

662
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,720
Peking University is appointing professors again.

663
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,720
Why don't you and Gao Yihan come to Peking University.

664
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,240
Peking University?

665
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
I've seen the list of appointees

666
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,960
for your Liberal Arts department.

667
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Not bad. Very comprehensively thought out.

668
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,920
But there's a problem.

669
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,280
The education ministry wouldn't process

670
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
so many at once.

671
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,000
I think we should do it in batches, to get around it.

672
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,000
Separate them in different groups.

673
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,000
For example, Liu Shipei,

674
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
Zhang Shizhao,

675
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,520
could be put on file with the education ministry.

676
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,720
Hello, Sirs.

677
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,440
Hello, students.

678
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,240
And as for the younger people,

679
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,320
particularly the ones who aren't well-known,

680
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,680
or those without academic qualifications,

681
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,360
we'll use the pathway

682
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,040
or sorting them in batches.

683
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,960
At present, there are three categories of young talents.

684
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,920
Those in the US usually have proper academic credentials.

685
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,960
Those in Japan rarely have official diplomas.

686
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,880
And then there are those who didn't attend university,

687
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,880
but have some degree of renown in China.

688
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,600
Like Liu Bannong, Liang Shuming etc.

689
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,040
"From wind and rain comes China's vital force,"

690
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
"What a great pity not to hear a neighing horse!"

691
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,000
"I urge the Lord of Heaven to shake us up again,"

692
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080
"And grant us talent not bound to a single kind."

693
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,560
The last few lines of Gong Zichen's poem

694
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,360
will serve as Peking University's general principle for appointing professors.

695
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,720
What "not bound to a single kind" means is--

696
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,040
Greetings, sir.

697
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,760
Greetings, student.

698
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,880
is learning to be flexible and accomodate different arrangements and ways.

699
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,360
For example, Zhang Shizhao, Li Dazhao

700
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,680
They are in the middle of running "Jiayin", unable to leave it. (?)

701
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080
Especially Zhang Shizhao, who told me

702
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,040
He will only be the head of Peking University's library for half a year.

703
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,080
"After half a year, I'll get Li Dazhao to take over."

704
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
This way Li Dazhao's problem is solved.

705
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,600
Another example, Liu Banong, he has no educational background. 

706
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,480
So we will appoint him to be the professor of preparatory courses.

707
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,120
In short, attract talent by any means necessary.

708
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
So we can have talented people all gathered in Peking University.

709
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,960
Right. 

710
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,560
Right now, there are some talents in other parts of the country. 

711
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,840
Even abroad.

712
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,960
They won't be able to get here for some time.

713
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,920
I am wondering if we should also take them into consideration.

714
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,600
First get them in.

715
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
People like Hu Shi, Wu Yu.

716
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,960
Of course. 

717
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,200
Hushi is a talent that is hard to come by. 

718
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,400
Since he has --

719
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,040
Greetings, sir. 

720
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,680
Greetings, student.

721
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,000
Since he has this PhD,

722
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,040
appointing him,

723
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
making an exception will not cause any problems.

724
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
Just now you talked about overseas.

725
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,480
Greetings, sir.

726
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,280
Greetings, student.

727
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,320
There is one called Yang Changji, do you know?

728
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,320
He is teaching in Changsha, Hunan.

729
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,600
A literature bachelor's degree from the University of Aberdeen.

730
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,080
Greetings, sir.

731
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,120
Greetings, student.

732
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,720
How about it. Let's hire him at Peking University. 

733
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,760
Sure!

734
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,100
[Hunan province, first established teacher-training school]

735
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,040
Mr. Yi

736
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,360
Greetings, sir.

737
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,280
Mr. Yi.

738
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,600
How's it going here with you?

739
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,760
You can see it is already almost tidied up here.
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Cun, new culture movement scholar] 

740
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,160
Come, I'll do some introductions. 

741
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,880
This is Yi Baisha, Mr. Yi.

742
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,040
He is one of the chief writers of "New Youth"

743
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,680
and the author of "A Critique of Confucius"

744
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,120
Sir, hello.
[Mao Zedong, styled Runzhi, student of Hunan province's first normal university]

745
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,480
Hello.

746
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,040
This person is our student.

747
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,000
Called Mao Zedong.

748
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,080
He is our "New Youth's"

749
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,680
zealous follower.

750
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,440
As a matter of fact,

751
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,560
hearing that you came,

752
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,000
he wouldn't stop bothering me

753
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
to take him to see you

754
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,520
and ask for guidance on some problems.

755
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,080
As soon as he starts talking about politics

756
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,000
he always brings up "New Youth."

757
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,280
He even nitpicks for us.

758
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,040
Finding errors and correcting mistakes in "New Youth."

759
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Is that right?

760
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,760
In that case I want to hear about

761
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,040
what errors you've found.

762
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,800


763
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
Sir. I believe Mr. Chen Duxiu's

764
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
six guiding principles in New Youth

765
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,520
is not very comprehensive.

766
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,520
I believe at the very least, there needs to be an additional

767
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,760
"Be sturdy, and not frail."

768
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,640
Those foreigners

769
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,480
don't they always say we are the sick men of Asia? 

770
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,560
Sick men, they are not able to save China. 

771
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,880
Good, very well said.

772
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,120
When there's a chance, I will surely take your idea

773
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,880
and convey it to Mr. Zhongfu.

774
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,040
Sir, thank you.

775
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,840
How's this,

776
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,840
why don't you two have a chat.

777
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,200
I still have matters to be busy with.

778
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
I'll... take my leave first. 

779
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,400
Take care, sir.

780
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,920
Sir.

781
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,840
I have a presumptuous request.

782
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,800
I... have written an essay,

783
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,040
and would like to ask you for some pointers.

784
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,400
Sure.

785
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,080
Please, sit.

786
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,640
Okay.

787
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,320
"A Study of Physical Education"

788
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,040
Our nation is wanting in strenght. The military spirit has not been encouraged;

789
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,320
The physical condition of the population deteriorates daily.

790
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,760
This is an extremely disturbing phenomenon.

791
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,800
The promoters of physical education have no grasped the essence of the problem,

792
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,120
and therefore, their efforts, though prolonged, have not been effective.

793
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,680
Our weakness wil increase further...

794
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,400
Impressive! 

795
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,160
The start of the essay is impressive!

796
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
I invite you, sir, to lend your advice.

797
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Good essay , good essay.

798
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,480
It really is a good essay! 

799
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,680
This is the first essay I've seen

800
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,000
that systematically investigates physical education in China.

801
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
This, with regards to promoting New Youth, New Culture

802
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,080
and our promotion of new life

803
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,760
is of great benefit.

804
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,640
Honestly speaking,

805
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,480
I wouldn't be able to write an essay like this.

806
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,640
Sir, you flatter me.

807
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,360
How's this?

808
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,880
I'll write a recommendation letter for you. 

809
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,000
Have this essay

810
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
sent to Mr. Chen Duxiu in Beijing. 

811
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,120
I believe

812
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,480
he will surely publish it.

813
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,680
Sir.

814
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,920
If you feel that this piece of essay is written well.

815
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,760
I will send it to Mr. Chen Duxiu right away. 

816
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,800
As for

817
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,920
the recommendation letter.

818
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,960
It is not needed.

819
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,720
I'm afraid it will influence Mr. Chen Duxiu's judgement.

820
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,000
Alright.

821
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,280
You have a bright future.

822
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,040
Scissors sharpening! Knife sharpening!
[Jiangan Lane, Beijing] 

823
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,080
This essay,

824
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,760
Liu Bannong looked at it and thought it was well written.

825
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,880
Very insightful.

826
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,240
However, given that there are no comparable articles

827
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,560
about physical education to use as a reference,

828
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,760
plus the fact

829
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
the author is still a student of a teacher-training school,

830
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,600
its impact will be limited.

831
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,160
We can first put it aside, and talk about it again later. (?)

832
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,920
Then, what's your opinion?

833
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,000
What I mean is that the article itself is not bad,

834
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,200
but

835
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,920
all the articles published in this issues are from well-known authors.

836
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,360
We can put it aside for the time being.

837
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,800
I don't agree with this opinion from you two.

838
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,400
I feel this essay

839
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
can be the start of research into physical education.

840
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,800
It's significant for providing guidance for youth.

841
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
This author with the penname "Twenty-Eight Strokes"

842
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,080
is Mao Zedong

843
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,200
Only twenty four years old.

844
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,880
To be able to write an essay like this is very amazing. 

845
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,080
This publication of articles like this

846
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,400
is important for motivating and encouraging youth.

847
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,080
My opinion is to publish it in this issue.

848
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,960
Okay, I'll go back and discuss it with Bannong. 

849
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
What's there to discuss? Publish it right away.

850
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,480
Everyone,

851
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,800
Today is our Peking University's

852
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,480
first discussion forum.

853
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
The subject is to look into and discuss

854
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,720
Peking University's list of appointed professors in the Liberal Arts department.

855
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,800
Right now, Mr. Chen Duxiu is invited

856
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,560
to provide an explanation of the list of names for us.

857
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,040
Dear committee members,

858
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,320
the list of names that has been given to everyone

859
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,360
is based on what Mr. Cai has set

860
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,080
as Peking University's general educational reform guidelines.

861
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,960
It is based on a systemic investigation of

862
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,680
the top talents in each area of the humanities

863
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
as well as consideration of what is pratically required

864
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,000
to construct our Liberal Arts department at Peking University.

865
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,080
It follows Mr. Cai's thoughts

866
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,200
on establishing Peking University's long term development,

867
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,160
and applies his principle of not being bound to only one way of selecting talent.

868
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,240
Our list of names pays particular attention

869
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,160
to young and middle-aged people with talent.

870
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,360
To sum it up,

871
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,440
this list of names consists of three types of talents.

872
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,880
The first is experts with achievements and influence

873
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,560
who are academically well-known.

874
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,400
Such as Zhang Shizhao,

875
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,240
Gu Hongming, Yang Changji

876
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,240
Liu Shipei, Huang Kan, and so on. 

877
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,080
The second is those who are abroad and finished studying

878
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,440
or about to return to China,

879
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,560
who have already shown some promise.

880
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,760
Such as Jiang Menglin, Hu Shi, Xu Beihong 

881
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,840
Gao Yihan, Li Dazhao, and so on.

882
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,320
The third is those with no educational background 

883
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,480
but truly has genuine talent,

884
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,120
with some small amount of renown.

885
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Such as Liang Shuming, Liu Bannong, and so on.

886
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,640
What needs to be emphasized is

887
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,480
This is a big list, divided into batches, ranks

888
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,520
different positions, and appointment tracks.

889
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,320
It is a list of qualified people,

890
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,800
and not necessarily a list of names we will immediately hire.

891
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,360
Seeing as there is quite a number of people,

892
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,280
and committee members are already very familiar

893
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,720
with some names on the list,

894
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,920
I won't introduce them one by one.

895
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,600
Now, each committee members is invited to do their duty

896
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,000
and start the discussion.

897
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,000
In my opinion, the standard for professors at Peking Univesity

898
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
should combine both ability and integrity, putting virtue first.

899
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,560
Some people, although they are educated and famous,

900
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,240
were willing running dogs of Yuan Shikai,

901
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,640
and notorious royalists.

902
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,160
People like this,

903
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,600
in my view, have no right to be professors at the new Peking University.

904
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,120
Brother Deqian,

905
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,800
you have your heart set on smashing my rice bowl. [taking away my job]

906
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,480
Was I not telling the truth?

907
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,600
Gentlemen Qian,

908
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,200
Of those named on the list, or sitting here,

909
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,360
I am not the only royalist.

910
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,320
Say it clearly! Who is a running dog!

911
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,760
Say it clearly!

912
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,440
Who is a royalist?

913
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,160
Do you still need me to say it?

914
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,920
It is self evident.

915
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,040
Apologies, Mr. Qian,

916
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,600
forgive me for interrupting your speech.

917
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,080
What you said is right.

918
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,360
Peking University's appointed professors need to have both ability and integrity.

919
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,040
I totally agree.

920
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,160
But if you say that royalists are without virtue by definition,

921
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,080
then I beg to differ.

922
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,760
At present, as China is undergoing turbulent transformation,

923
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,000
we are all seeking a way out.

924
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,160
All kinds of political views should be in conflict with each other.

925
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,440
The Peking University I envision is for teaching and educating people,

926
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,200
a place of research and learning.

927
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,600
For there to be all kinds of debates and academic point of views,

928
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,200
is a normal phenomenon. 

929
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,800
It is said that people of noble character can be in disagreement 
but get along with one another.

930
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,520
All the more reason for us to be inclusive.

931
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,240
For example, in the study of culture,

932
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,320
should we modernize or remain traditional?

933
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
All can give their own view, let a hundred schools of thought contend!

934
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,480
Only in this way, with this progressive culture,

935
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,720
could we distinguish ourselves.

936
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,640
Mr. Chen,

937
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,720
you are the flag carrier of new culture.

938
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,160
What do you think, amongst those present today, 

939
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,440
who, because they venerate Confucius,

940
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,280
are without virtue?

941
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,400
I've never thought those who venerate Confucius are without virtue.

942
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,400
There are two kinds of people who venerate Confucius.

943
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,920
Those who are academic Confucians.

944
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,920
And those who are political Confucians.

945
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,320
The discipline of Confucianism

946
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,440
was originally one school of thought out of the hundred

947
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,560
from the Spring and Autumn Period.

948
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,760
One field of knowledge.

949
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,840
It is wide-ranging and profound, long-standing and well-established.
