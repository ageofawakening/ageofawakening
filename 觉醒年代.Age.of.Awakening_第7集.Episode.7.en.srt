00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,524
[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:07,559
[Episode Seven]

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,800
The topic of today's meeting is

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,120
reforming Peking University's teaching work.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,040
This subject,

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,520
five years prior, when I was Minster of Education,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,800
is what I brought up. 

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,280
Today, we can truly put it into practice.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
This shows the difficulty of reform.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,680
In the face of such difficult reforms,

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,160
there must be a condition:

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
that is unity.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,040
The first step of reform

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,360
is to set up a board of trustees.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
This board of trustees

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
is composed of the president and deans of various discplines

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,160
as well as professors who are represented by assessors.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,800
For every five professors in the school,

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,760
one trustee must be elected.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
The president is the chief trustee,

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,520
and all major school matters

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,360
must be examined and approved by the board of trustees,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,720
such as the development of various rules and regulations,

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,240
determining the abolition and establishment of disciplines

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,480
or of academic titles of professors,

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,280
the school budget, and so on.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
All have to go through the university board of trustees.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,120
Therefore, we obligate every professor of each discipline

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
to be reappointed.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
To bring the best talents

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,240
including foreign.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
We must accept all to Peking University

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
and abolish those unqualified professors,

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,760
including foreign professors.

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,760
This task is very complicated.

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,480
So we should start with liberal arts.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
May Mr. Zhongfu put all his energy into this area

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,680
and come up with a specific plan as soon as possible.

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,000
Give it to the school board of trustees for discussion and approval.

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,280
Understood.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,160
Good.

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,400
That's all for today's meeting.

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,040
Good.

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,120
Professor Gu.

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,000
This is over, too.

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
The two of us can spar in the small grounds on campus.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,760
Others can attend.

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
Please.

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,240
Brother Zhongfu, please stay.

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
I want to talk to you.

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
Let's sit down and talk.

52
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,880
Brother Zhongfu is a researcher of Chinese history.

53
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:47,451
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,960
Do you know

55
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,960
which era of Chinese history

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,600
it reminds me of at the moment?

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,480
Hot.

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
The Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period before Qin Dynasty.

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,880
What was the situation of the era at that time?

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
The Western Zhou Dynasty destroyed rites and music.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
At the time, no one knew where to go from there.

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,259
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,200
Everyone is looking for a way out.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
But the key point

65
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,280
is that in that period,

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,240
there was no unified royal authority,

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,880
so all kinds of learning came out.

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
You say yours, I'll say mine.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
So it's a pleasure to fight it out.

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,680
Right.

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,240
The Hundred Schools of Thought. How lively.

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
Therefore, culture is the forerunner of politics.

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,160
Brother Zhongfu, I don't know if you found out.

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,040
We are very similar to the pre-Qin period now.

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
No matter what era the future develops,

76
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
it will eventually be based on us.

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,240
The New Culture advocated today is the forerunner.

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
It is also based on the break with the old culture.

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,051
No.

80
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:11,246
No.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
I disagree with you.

82
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,520
This culture, it is inseparable.

83
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,280
Its new culture can only grow in

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
the naked protection of the old culture.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,800
It just abandons and innovates the old culture,

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,760
and can't be uniform in academic research.

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
We must encourage and support a Hundred Schools of Thought.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
What Mr. means is

89
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,760
Peking University should continue to hire

90
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
these old-fashioned die-hard professors.

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,360
Yes.

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
But the New Culture

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
is a grass that just broke ground.

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
How can you stand

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
the crazy trampling of the old forces?

96
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
What's wrong?

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,920
You, Chen Duxiu, are not confident.

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
What did you tell me yesterday?

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
I mean, I want to fight

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
but I really don't want to

101
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,400
with these stubborn old-fashioned professors

102
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
all day long.

103
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Look at this Gu Hongming.

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
The moment I arrived, I was given (fig.) a show of strength.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
Of course I'm going to make an appointment with him on the playground.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,560
Brother Zhongfu.

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
As the Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University,

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
you can't tolerate people.

109
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
You know, people and culture are the most complicated.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
In today's chaotic era,

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,280
in fact, everyone is looking for a way out for the country,

112
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,840
but the thinking is different.

113
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,680
You take for example Gu Hongming.

114
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
Although some people say that he is a die-hard royalist,

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
full of justice akin to the Spring and Autumn Period,

116
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,280
but we have to admit

117
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,040
Gu Hongming's exposition and criticism of Western culture

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,040
is still of great positive significance.

119
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,720
People like you and me who have been abroad for many years

120
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
should feel the same way.

121
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,440
Right?

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,080
Master Cai benefited a lot from his words.

123
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,360
You are flattering me.

124
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
There is also you and me,

125
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,560
Mr. Liu Shipei, a fellow of the Yuewang Association.

126
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,560
He recently sent me a letter.

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
This person,

128
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,960
He is a famous six gentlemen (?)

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
and also wrote to Yuan Shikai

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,240
"On restoring ancient ways to the country by the monarch". (?)

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,320
What did he say in his letter about me?

132
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,000
First, it refutes

133
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Hu Shi's "Discussion on Literary Improvement".

134
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,920
Second,

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,800
he actively asked to teach at Peking University.

136
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
This Liu Shipei

137
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
has done a lot of things.

138
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
But he is a scholar.

139
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,880
Right as rice beam. (?)

140
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,280
Brother Zhongfu.

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
My dream

142
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
is for Peking University to become

143
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
a great academic stage with outstanding talents,

144
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,400
because only in this way

145
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,120
can we breed a healthy new culture.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,600
I asked Brother Zhongfu to come to Peking University as the Dean of Liberal Arts.

147
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
This is where it all started. (?)

148
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
Brother Jiemin.

149
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,560
Now I miss it very much.

150
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,280
When we were making bombs together,

151
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,720
at least that time,

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
you didn't talk around.

153
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,880
I see.

154
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,120
You mean not only to keep Gu Hongming

155
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,400
and let me fight with him,

156
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,200
but also to bring the old-fashioned Liu Shipei

157
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
to Peking University, right?

158
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
I carefully understand Master Cai's ingenuity.

159
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
I live up to the great trust.

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhongfu.

161
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,960
Students, the fate of the literary revolution

162
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
has not been brewing for a day.

163
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,886
[Gu Hongming, styled Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

164
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,640
The first to raise the banner of righteousness

165
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
was my friend Hu Shi,

166
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,640
willing to brave the enemies of the national scholars

167
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
to raise the banner of the Cultural Revolutionary Army.

168
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
Think of my friend's solidarity (?)

169
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,560
Great books on the flag (?)

170
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
Three principles of our revolutionary army (?)

171
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,440
I say, push down the carved aristocratic literature,

172
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,360
build an easy and lyrical national literature,

173
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,960
push down the stale and extravagant classical literature,

174
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,360
construct a fresh and honest realistic literature.

175
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,200
I say, push down the arduous mountain forest literature,

176
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
build a clear and popular social literature.

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,080
Aye! Aye! Aye!

178
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,880
Aye!

179
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,560
Mr. Chen has well said!

Aye! Aye! Aye!

181
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,440
Aye!

Everyone's in class.

187
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,720
Almost there. Almost there. Almost there.

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,880
How long can you last?

189
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,440
He's coming!

190
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
He's coming! He's coming!

191
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,520
OK, OK, OK.

192
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,840
Rise.

193
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,760
Bow.

194
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
Greetings, sir.

195
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,414
[Huang Kan, styled Ligang, Professor at Peking University]

196
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,680
Greetings, students. Sit.

197
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,880
Fellow students,

198
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,400
let's enjoy all the strange articles today.

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,400
Recently in America,

200
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,960
there was a young man named Hu Shi

201
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,080
who wrote several poems in vernacular Chinese.

202
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,960
It was published in the famous

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
"New Youth" magazine

204
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,440
and won a slice of applause.

205
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
It's ridiculous!

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,240
I've seen this article.

207
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,960
It's like a lot of cattle.

208
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,960
People can't eat it,

209
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
and think like rainbow flies in a hut.

210
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
Making people thin and sleepless.

211
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Therefore, from now on,

212
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
I will make a rule.

213
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
That is, before class every day,

214
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,520
I will spend twenty minutes

215
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,840
criticizing this vernacular poem

216
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,440
until it is overturned and stinky.

217
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,680
Mr. Ligang.

218
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,720
If you don't want the "New Youth"

219
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
you threw on the ground.

220
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
Can I pick it up?

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
You can consider it a bargain.

222
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,560
Wait, wait.

223
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,040
Put it back.

224
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
Didn't you not want it?

225
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,480
Pick it up.

226
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,520
Mister can disagree with the ideas in the book,

227
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,120
but don't throw the book away.

228
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,840
What ideas?

229
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,520
It's all nonsense!

230
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,320
I'm going to throw it a hundred times, thousand times!

231
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,760
Pick it up!

232
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Sir, let me pick it up for you.

233
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,720
Sir.

234
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,880
How many times will you throw it in the future?

235
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,480
How many times will I help you pick it up?

236
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,440
I've wrapped up the job.

237
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,040
Go back!

238
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,360
Of course.

239
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,320
Sir!

240
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
If you throw it again, I'll pick it up for you.

241
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,680
Students can't pick it up.

242
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,480
Pick it up!

243
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,120
Quiet!

244
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,280
Sit down.

245
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920
Students, let's get down to business.

246
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,160
Writing poems in vernacular Chinese.

247
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,600
What a joke.

248
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,240
This is just lunatic ravings!

249
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
Self-delusions!

250
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,160
What is poetry?

251
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,920
The essentials of poetry. What is the essence of poetry?

252
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
To sum it up in one word,

253
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
it is refined.

254
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,320
What is vernacular speech?

255
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,400
It can also be covered in one word,

256
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
it is vulgar.

257
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,640
One is refined, one is vulgar.

258
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
One is holy, one is obscene.

259
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
Can we mentioned these in the same breath?

260
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,840
Can we pass off fish eyes as pearls?

261
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
Sir.

262
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
I think literature should be both refined and popular.

263
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Old-style poetry and vernacular poetry go hand in hand.

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Wouldn't the freedom to develop be better?

265
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Confusion!

266
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,160
This poetry is poetic prose is text is words.

267
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,640
If you want to represent everything in vernacular,

268
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,640
why do you need poetry?

269
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160
what else does Peking University do?

270
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
Do you still need to travel thousands of miles

271
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
from Hunan to Beijing to go to school?

272
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,440
Sir.

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760
Vernacular poetry is really popular now.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,560
Female students in normal universities

275
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320
keep Mr. Shizhi's poems in their hands every day,

[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhonghao, Student at Peking University]

277
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
and they organize vernacular poetry readings.

278
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,640
Exactly.

279
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,120
Right.

280
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,640
Our Peking University student union

281
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400
is also preparing for a poetry recital.

282
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,000
Many professors have come to attend.

283
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
such as Professor Chen Duxiu,

284
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,280
Professor Qian Xuantong,

285
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,720
and Professor Shen Yinmo.

286
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,760
They all come to attend.

287
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,640
Right!

288
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
(?)

289
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,720
Yeah! Yeah!

290
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Quiet!

291
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
Deng Zhongxia, I ask you.

292
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Whose student are you?

293
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480
Are you my, Huang Kan's, protege?

294
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,120
Or that Chen Duxiu's filial son and grandson?

295
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
Sir.

296
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,280
To Sir, with Love. (?)

297
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,640
Love the truth more.

298
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Well, since you're talking about the truth.

299
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
Then I'll tell you what truth is.

300
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080
What the teacher says is truth.

301
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
Dignity is truth.

302
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
You are arguing irrationally.

303
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680
Guo Xingang, what did you say there?

304
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,200
He said you argue irrationally!

305
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,320
Quiet!

306
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,760
Guo Xingang, Deng Zhongxia.

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
You two ignore discipline.

308
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Gathering people to make trouble and scold the teacher.

309
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,920
Outrageous!

310
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,560
You two get away from me.

311
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,520
Get away!

312
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,240
Get away! Get away! Get away!

313
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,200
Quiet!

314
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,840
A wall of dirt can not be an altar.

315
