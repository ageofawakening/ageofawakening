00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,120


238
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,280


239
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920


240
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,160


241
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,600


242
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,240


243
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240


244
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,160


245
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,920


246
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000


247
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560


248
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,320


249
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,400


250
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160


251
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,640


252
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920


253
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000


254
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,840


255
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760


256
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440


257
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760


258
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,840


259
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120


260
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,160


261
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,640


262
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,640


263
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160


264
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320


265
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560


266
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,440


267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760


268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,560


269
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320


270
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320


271
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,640


272
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,120


273
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,640


274
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400


275
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,000


276
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920


277
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,280


278
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,720


279
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,760


280
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,640


281
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640


282
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,720


283
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,600


284
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560


285
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560


286
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480


287
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,120


288
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280


289
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,280


290
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,640


291
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520


292
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240


293
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080


294
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040


295
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680


296
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680


297
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,200


298
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,320


299
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,760


300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600


301
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920


302
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,920


303
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,560


304
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,520


305
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,240


306
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,200


307
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,840


308
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,000


309
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,640


310
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,160


311
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
Today's lecture is on "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons."

312
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,680
Open your textbooks.

313
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,320
Gentlemen, students,

314
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,000
let's begin our meeting.

315
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,280
Liberal Arts professor Huang Kan has submitted a complaint in writing to Mr. Cai

316
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,080
regarding the students Deng Zhongxia and Guo Xingang

317
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,520
for disrupting classroom order,

318
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
insulting the teacher, and deviating from Confucian doctrine,

319
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,920
and requests the appropriate disciplinary actions be taken.

320
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,200
Mister Cai has instructed the school to lead an investigation

321
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,560
and ascertain the facts of the matter,

322
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,560
as well as propose suggestions on how to handle it.

323
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
For the sake of prudence,

324
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,120
Mr. Cai is personally attending this meeting.

325
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
Professor Huang Kan is invited to begin the litigations.

326
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,600
Mr. Wu just now misspoke.

327
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,000
This can't be called a lawsuit.

328
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,840
We are here to have a discussion today,

329
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,320
to express our own opinions.

330
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,480
Mr. Huang Kan is invited to express his opinion.

331
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,400
Peking University has always respected the dignity of the teaching profession.

332
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,720
It is a law-abiding school with rules.

333
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,920
But recently,

334
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,360
the so-called New Culture school of thought has enticed

335
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,040
a section of students to be confused in their thinking and lacking in their discipline.

336
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,560
To the point of openly stirring up trouble in class,

337
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
and insulting their teachers.

338
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
It is truly preposterous.

339
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,520
If this can be tolerated, what cannot?

340
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,160
The culprits Guo Xingang and Deng Zhongxia

341
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,200
must be disciplined by the school as a warning to others.

342
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,520
What?

343
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,440
Guo Xingang and Deng Zhongxia...

344
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,280
Hurling abuse at teachers?

345
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,080
Really!

346
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,040
What about the dignity of the teaching profession?

347
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
Quiet down, everyone.

348
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,640
Everyone, quiet. Everyone, quiet down.

349
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
Be quiet, everyone.

350
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,200
The student Deng Zhongxia is invited to address the litigations against him.

351
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,160
No, not litigations.

352
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
To present his side of the argument.

353
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,360
You may speak.

354
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,440
Honoured teachers, gentlemen.

355
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,840
We didn't disrupt classroom conduct.

356
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
We merely didn't entirely agree

357
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,560
with Professor Huang Kan's viewpoint on vernacular Chinese verse,

358
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
and his attitude in the classroom

359
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,840
towards "New Youth" magazine.

360
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,840
In the classroom we entered into some discussion

361
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,800
and debate.

362
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,200
I believe

363
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
this should be under the purview of academic freedom.

364
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,440
And not "hurling abuse at the teacher."

365
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,560
Deng Zhongxia,

366
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,080
how can you lie?

367
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
Why don't you tell the truth?

368
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
I testify that Guo Xingang

369
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,880
truly did insult Professor Huang Kan, using specious arguments and sophistry.

370
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,720
We all saw it.

371
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,520
Yes!

372
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,320
We saw it all.

373
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,880
Gentlemen,

374
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
Professor Wang Kan personally attacked

375
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,600
"New Youth" and vernacular poetry in class.

376
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,680
He said "New Youth" was fly-covered cowshit

377
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
and that the writers of vernacular Chinese were idiots.

378
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
But also that his words were the truth,

379
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,800
unquestionably so.

380
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
Is this not preposterous sophistry?

381
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
It is! It is!

382
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,920
Quiet, everyone.

383
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
Quiet, everyone. Quiet.

384
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,160
Quiet, everyone.

385
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,680
Dean Chen, this is an affair of the liberal arts department.

386
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,200
Please state your thoughts.

387
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,760
The origin of this has to do with vernacular writing

388
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,840
and "New Youth" magazine.

389
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
I am heavily implicated in this matter

390
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,120
and am in fact the biggest idiot, according to Professor Wang Kan.

391
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,520
Vernacular speech belongs to those who are idiots

392
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
so as an idiot I better remain silent

393
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
and not speak any idiocies.

394
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,680
Gentlemen,

395
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it is very clear to me what the whole story is.

396
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
Who is right and who is wrong is already self evident.

397
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
In my opinion, the party subjected to disciplinary action

398
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
should not be a few students who dare to presevere with the truth

399
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,920
but rather the one who used the classroom to publicly vent their personal spite.

400
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
The thief who cries thief, Professor Wang Kan.

401
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,600
Wang Kan was vulgar in his speech,

402
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
absurd in his conduct

403
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
and falls far short of Peking University's motto

404
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,280
and Master Cai's objectives for our school.

405
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
Behaviour simply not deserving of being called a teacher.

406
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,960
This kind of person should be cleared out of Peking University.

407
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,440
Right!

408
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,320
Does everyone agree?

409
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,120
I agree!

410
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,840
Cleared out of Peking University!

411
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,280
We shouldn't want this kind of professor!

412
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,680
Exactly!

413
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,640
Stop your hubbub.

414
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,680
You shut up!

415
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,800
Mr. Qian Xuantong, you were too harsh.

416
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
Wang Jigang acted in the interest of the public good,

417
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,560
to uphold our national culture and refute heresies.

418
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,320
It is not a crime.

419
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,400
Completely unreasonable remarks!

420
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,080
[Shen Yinmo, Peking University Professor]

421
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
In that case, is it a crime

422
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,320
for students to support new culture,

423
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,560
to take a stand on a matter of principle?

424
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,600
Invalid!

425
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,160
Valid!

426
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
Evil heresies!

427
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,240
It is right and proper to support new culture.

428
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,280
Everyone, please sit down. Please sit down.

429
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Let's hear what Mr. Cai has to say.

430
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,560
Today, attending this...

431
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
this discussion forum,

432
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,800
I had not planned to speak.

433
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
But I am moved by everyone's

434
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
fierce and frank participation just now,

435
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,120
so I will say a few words.

436
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,440
To speak bluntly,

437
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200
I think this discussion forum is very good.

438
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,880
To discuss problems freely when they arise, and collect suggestions.

439
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,920
This, in itself,

440
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
is an aspect of our reform measures at Peking University.

441
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,240
What everyone was just discussing

442
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,800
is a question of the school's rules and regulations.

443
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
We do have customs at Peking University.

444
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
In my opinion, Peking University's most important custom

445
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,360
is scientific democracy, inclusive, in all its forms.

446
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,080
What is the premise of scientific democracy?

447
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
It is equality.

448
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
Everyone is equal before the truth.

449
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,520
Not to mention teachers and students.

450
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,760
Inclusive, in all its forms.

451
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,040
That refers to everyone

452
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,920
being able to express their academic opinions.

453
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,680
To hold forth to their heart's content.

454
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,640
This should be our school tradition at Peking University.

455
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,160
I believe discussions like today's

456
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
will occur often at Peking University in the future.

457
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,720
I also hope this kind of discussion forum,

458
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,800
even if it is a bit fierce,

459
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,880
as long as it is useful for teaching,

460
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
the more there are, the merrier.

461
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,520
Well said!

462
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,760
[Spring, 1917]

463
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
Slow down, don't fall.

464
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
Don't let the two of them trip.

465
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
These days, once things are looking up, time just flies by.

466
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
Three months have passed in the blink of an eye.

467
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,600
I thought these three months were quite long.

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,840
People are always rushing to argue with me.

469
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,400
Trembling with fear, walking on thin ice.

470
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Oh, please.

471
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,880
It takes two to tango.

472
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
My wife knows me.

473
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,400
Wife, take it easy.

474
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,760
So busy with this and that as soon as you get here.

475
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,080
Can't you take a little break?

476
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,480
If I take a break,

477
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,240
when will this house get tidied?

478
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,960
Wife,

479
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,800
come, rest a while.

480
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,840
Drink some tea.

481
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,920
Set aside your job. I can do it too.

482
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
You do it?

483
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
You only know how to flap your lips.

484
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,360
Why don't you just save me some trouble.

485
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,360
The more you help, the more fuss.

486
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,880
I feel winter in Beijing

487
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,240
is more comfortable than in Shanghai.

488
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
With a fire, it's warmer inside than outside.

489
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
In Shanghai, during winter,

490
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,840
it's even colder inside than outside.

491
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,040
Yannian got several patches of frostbite on his feet.

492
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,880
How come?

493
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,400
From setting up those stall outside.

494
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,400
Has medicine been applied?

495
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,080
It's been applied.

496
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,840
But he won't listen to my advice.

497
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,280
Still insists on setting up the stalls.

498
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,720
Let me tell you something interesting.

499
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,040
Did you know, after you left,

500
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,680
Yannian suddenly came to visit one day.

501
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,040
To apologize to me.

502
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,240
Said that I was so concerned about them before,

503
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,160
helped them so much,

504
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,320
that he never expressed any gratitude towards me,

505
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,080
and that it was inappropriate of him.

506
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,000
And then he told me to stop worrying.

507
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,560
He can take care of himself now.

508
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,600
No more false bravado like before.

509
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,880
No more false bravado.

510
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,520
Setting up stalls even with frostbitten feet.

511
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,960
That's not false bravado?

512
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,240
That's enough.

513
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,240
He's a child after all.

514
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,560
It's already pretty good that he's this thoughtful.

515
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,480
He told me a great deal that day.

516
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,760
I feel,

517
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
he's truly grown-up a lot more compared to before.

518
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
But, right now he really enamoured with Wu Zhihui,

519
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,360
fascinated by his anarchism.

520
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
He's determined to do a work-study program in France.

521
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,600
Along with Qiaonian, he's even living at school now.

522
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,560
But they're still editors at "New Youth"

523
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,440
helping with publishing.

524
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,560
Wang Mengzou signed a contract with the two of them.

525
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
Each according to their work.

526
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,280
So they've figured out both school and life for themselves.

527
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,720
You don't need to worry.

528
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,160
It's not that easy to go to France for work-study.

529
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,360
France is fighting a war.

530
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
Don't know when it's going to end.

531
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,040
The two of them can't stay

532
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,480
in that French evening class forever.

533
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,720
Before, I wanted them to learn self-discipline.

534
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,520
Now it seems like

535
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
it would be more suitable for them to come to Beijing.

536
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,760
I heard Wu Zhihui say

537
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,840
that he is planning,

538
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,840
with Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng,

539
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,320
to establish a Sino-French university in France.

540
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,840
If that is successful,

541
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
then those two kids would have a way out.

542
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,720
Can't just follow whatever Wu Zhihui says.

543
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,280
That guy looks rough, but he's actually quite shrewd.

544
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,720
Kind face, cruel heart.

545
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
Hard to figure him out.

546
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,200
Yannian shouldn't get too close too him.

547
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,480
It's no good.

548
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I have to write him a letter. Advise him.

549
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,560
You're writing a letter?

550
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,720
You write.

551
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,160
I dictate. You write.

552
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
And go to the pharmacy.

553
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,080
Buy him a few boxes of tiger balm.

554
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,280
Send it together.

555
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,800
That's better.

556
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,080
Brother Zhongfu!

557
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,920
At the ceramic glaze factory

558
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
we found this old thing for sister-in-law.

559
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Careful, careful.

560
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
This must be sister-in-law.
[Li Dazhao, styled Shou Chang, editor of Tiger Daily]

Now, with Mr. Zhang Shizhao,

disciple of Shou Chang,

572
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,600
and an alumnus from your school.

573
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,320
Mrs. Chen.

574
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
Hello, Shiyan.

Guo Xingang, Bai Lan.

576
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
I met them in Japan.

Hello, Mrs. Chen.

578
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,840
Hello.

579
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,560
Sister-in-law, take a look at this. Do you like it?

580
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,880
It's too wonderful. Such a wonderful thing.

581
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,080
Where should it be placed?

582
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,720
Thanks.

583
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,640
How about in the bedroom?

584
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,440
Great.

585
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,320
That room, there.

586
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:42,960
Shiyan,

587
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,680
help move it in.

588
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,000
Sure.

589
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,280
Thank you.

590
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,720
It's so nice.

591
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,840
Thought you'd have need for it.

592
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
Shou Chang, it's an honour to meet you at last.

593
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,880
You article "New Youth," is deeply moving.

594
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,200
I often read it aloud when I'm by myself.

595
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,480
I really liked it.

596
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,240
Sister-in-law, you are too generous with your praise.

597
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,760
I've actually read your poetry before.

598
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Graceful and subdued like Li Qingzhao, heartbreaking.
[southen Song dynasty female poet]

599
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,840
What poetry?

600
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
That was just made up nonsense and venting.

601
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,280
Let's first have a seat.

602
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,040
After sitting down, you two can continue to flatter each other.

603
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,840
How's that?

604
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,280
Really!

605
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,840
Zhimei, Henian,

606
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
come and see Mr. Dazhao.

607
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,000
Hello, Mr. Dazhao.

608
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
Hello, you two darlings.

609
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,480
They look like you.

610
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,040
Take this, play over there.

611
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,560
You two sit.

612
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:24,960
Alright.

613
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,560
Here, Shou Chang, sit.

614
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,200
Alright.

615
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Sister-in-law,

616
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,720
now that you're here, I'm finally liberated.

617
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,000
What do you mean by that?

618
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,720
What do I mean by that?

619
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,920
This guy of yours,

620
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,920
mooching off of me every day after he got to Beijing.

621
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,280
It's one thing to mooch,

622
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,960
but he even disdained my cooking, saying it's inferior to yours.

623
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,440
Left me both mentally and physically exhausted.

624
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,080
What I've been eating these last three months has been pitiful.

625
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,200
You see!

626
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,480
I understand.

627
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,160
From now on Mr. Shou Chang,

628
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,520
you must come to eat at our home often.

629
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,240
You have to mooch back all the food he mooched from you!

630
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,760
What are we eating today?

631
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,240
Shou Chang,

632
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
you've been in Beijing for about a year now.

633
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,760
You should move your family here.

634
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,960
That's right.

635
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,720
Mr. Shou Chang is so valiant.

636
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
You must make a great couple.

637
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,000
A marriage of mutual respect.

638
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,640
Sister-in-law, you didn't know this.

639
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
My wife and I were an arranged child marriage.

640
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
When I was ten, my family was short of womenfolk.

641
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,920
So I was married off.

642
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,760
My wife is six years older than me,

643
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,640
and can't read very many characters. She's a genuine village girl.

644
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
But we are very fond of each other,

645
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,120
and have had four children together.

646
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,040
Two of them died young.

647
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,240
Mr. Shou Chang is of noble character and very admirable.

648
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,520
No matter what, you need to settle down your family.

649
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
Why don't you, sooner rather than later,

650
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,520
move your wife and children to Beijing.

651
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,440
I've actually had this thought.

652
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,680
But the situation in Beijing right now is unstable.

653
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,040
Incessant fighting between warlords.

654
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,880
Let's wait and see.

655
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,720
Peking University is appointing professors again.

656
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,720
Why don't you and Gao Yihan come to Peking University.

657
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,240
Peking University?

658
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
I've seen the list of appointees

659
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,960
for your Liberal Arts department.

660
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Not bad. Very comprehensively thought out.

661
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,920
But there's a problem.

662
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,280
The education ministry wouldn't process

663
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
so many at once.

664
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,000
I think we should do it in batches, to get around it.

665
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,000
Separate them in different groups.

666
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,000
For example, Liu Shipei,

667
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
Zhang Shizhao,

668
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,520
could be put on file with the education ministry.

669
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,720
Hello, Sirs.

670
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,440
Hello, students.

671
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,240
And as for the younger people,

672
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,320
particularly the ones who aren't well-known,

673
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,680
or those without academic qualifications,

674
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,360
we'll use the pathway

675
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,040
or sorting them in batches.

676
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,960
At present, there are three categories of young talents.

677
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,920
Those in the US usually have proper academic credentials.

678
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,960


679
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,880


680
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,880


681
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,120


682
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,200


683
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,920


684
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,000


685
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,160


686
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,400


687
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,640


688
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,040


689
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360


690
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,000


691
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080


692
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,560


693
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,360


694
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,720


695
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,040


696
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,760


697
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,880


698
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,360


699
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,680


700
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080


701
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,040


702
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,080


703
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480


704
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,600


705
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,480


706
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,120


707
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680


708
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,960


709
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,560


710
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,840


711
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,960


712
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,920


713
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,600


714
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000


715
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,960


716
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,200


717
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,400


718
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,040


719
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,680


720
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,000


721
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,040


722
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,320

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,600


729
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,080


730
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,120


731
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,720


732
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,760


733
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,040


734
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,200


735
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,040

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,000


748
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,080


749
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,680

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,440
