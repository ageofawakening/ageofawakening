Mr Cai, it's my responsibility

785
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,720
Mr Cai

786
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,160
Please speak

787
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,560
I have researched on some similar cases from overseas

788
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,160
For cases like these

789
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,480
We can get the school to organise a professors' union

790
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
to have a disucssion with the related parties' embassy

791
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,320
We will utilize diplomatic relations to mediate

792
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,440
If mediation fails

793
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,560
We will then go to the courts to file a lawsuit

794
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,320

It seems like these people

796
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,840
Did not sleep a wink last night

797
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,200
Mr Cai

798
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,920
Those who could not sleep last night

799
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,280
were not just us

800
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,840
De Qian, Ban Nong, Yi Han

801
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,160
and students Guo Xin Gang, Deng Zhong Xia

802
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,800
Many students spent the whole night

803
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,920
At the liberal arts office doing research

804
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,600
Deng Zhong Xia and the students still did drafting

805
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,440
Students of Peking University

806
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,840
drafted a a letter of resistance to the British Embassy

807
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,320
and an open letter to the Beiyang Government

808
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,920
in case of need

809
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,160
I, Cai Yuan Pei, have done a good job as Peking University Principal

810
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,680
I thank everyone for their support

811
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,960
Alright

812
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,280
Since everyone is on the same page,

813
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,280
there is no need to continue debating

814
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
I will call Fu Zeng Tian immediately

815
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,000
to tell him Peking University's stance

816
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,560
also, everyone should prepare

817
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,840
quickly organise the professors and student unions

818
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,280
and get ready

819
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,680
Mr Zhong Pu will be in charge of this matter

820
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,360
Does anyone have any objections?

821
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,240
No

822
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
Brother Buo Tang, I am reporting that

823
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,920
Peking University Committee members

824
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,640
strongly disagree with Ke De Lai

825
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,560
and the British Embassy's appeal

826
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,720
We must protect our country's sovereignty

827
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,480
and Peking University's rights

828
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,600
Alright

829
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,480
So, you are clear about

830
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,280
the consequences of your actions

831
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,560
and have a plan of action?

832
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,720
Aren't I here to ask for your help

833
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,160
Tell me

834
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,360
What should we do?

835
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
First you will have to obtain

836
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,560
Fu Zeng Xiang's empathy and support

837
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,920
I have already spoken with him

838
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,280
What did he say?

839
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,520
He just said he would resign

840
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,840
He is trying to shirk responsibility

841
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,200
Regardless.

842
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,880
I am still thankful to the both of you

843
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,320
Look,

844
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,960
I'll treat you to lunch this afternoon,

845
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,680
alright?

846
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,440
Sure

847
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,560
Openly trying to woo key government officials

848
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,000
Please just do me this favour

849
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,120
Alright

850
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,680
Come

851
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,440
Please come in

852
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,080
How are the both of you?

853
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
You just sampled our shaoxing cuisine

854
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,920
Does it suit your palate?

855
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,400
We are obliged to help you since you have treated us

856
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,920
What schemes do you have?

857
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,880
Duan Qi Rui is going to listen to the reports this afternoon

858
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,640
If we can't get through this obstacle,

859
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,800
Both of us will have to resign

860
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,760
That's right

861
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,920
This issue is urgent and serious

862
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,440
This morning, Zhu Er Dian

863
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,280
called 3 times to ask about the outcome

864
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,880
Alright

865
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,360
Please drink some tea

866
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,480
If that's the case

867
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,720
Let me explain the situation to the both of you

868
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,720
I will be honest

869
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
Peking University Committee members

870
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,600
none of them are cowards

871
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,440
The meeting this morning

872
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,040
Before I finished speaking

873
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,320
The whole atmosphere was tense

874
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,160
Everyone decided

875
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,480
to fight till the end

876
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,120
We will never embarrass this country and Peking University

877
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,400
So how do you plan to fight?

878
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,560
We will form a professor's union and have discussions with the British Embassy

879
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,760
What if you don't come to a conclusion?

880
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,560
We will then go to court

881
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,480
What about Duan Qi Rui?

882
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,240
He is a temperamental warlord

883
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,440
Duan Qi Rui is still Chinese after all

884
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
He can't possibly betray his ancestors

885
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,480
We will reason with him

886
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,560
I don't think he will be receptive to

887
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,120
Those pathetic idelogies of yours

888
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,080
What are you saying

889
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,240
How are they pathetic?

890
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,400
Firstly, we have documents about the 2 governments

891
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,160
It is enough to prove that

892
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,880
Ke De Lai's dismissal is legal

893
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
Secondly, we have strong evidence

894
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,280
To prove that Ke De Lai's dismissal is logical

895
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,280
As a government official

896
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,200
Duan Qi Rui will be

897
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
The one who protects our rights

898
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,240
He will not betray us right?

899
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,080
I can say this very confidently

900
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,480
Duan Qi Rui will never pay heed to

901
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,400
Whatever you are suggesting

902
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,120
Cai Zi Min don't try to fool us

903
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Please reveal what you have up your sleeve

904
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
You know me so well Brother Bo Tang

905
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,760
Apart from the evidence I mentioned

906
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,240
We will give Minister Duan

907
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,080
2 items

908
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,640
The first is a letter written by Peking University Staff and Students

909
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,880
To the government

910
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,680
The other item is a letter of resistance

911
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,480
Written by Peking University students to the British Embassy

912
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
Are you sure these items are useful?

913
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,640
Of course

914
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,280
Cai Zi Min, you are good

915
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,280
This is sly of you

916
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,480
You have targeted Duan Qi Rui's weak spot

917
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,000
Mr Fu

918
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,080
Take these items with you

919
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,280
when you meet Duan Qi Rui in the afternoon

920
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
I guarantee you he will not only be able control his anger

921
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,600
he will also beg for your help

922
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
At that time, tell him to look for me

923
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,280
Both of you are making me confused

924
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,480
This matter cannot be clear enough

925
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,640
Duan Qi Rui knows how important this matter is

926
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,240
I never thought

927
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,240
Brother Zi Min could be so cunning

928
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,720
I'm in awe of you

929
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,160
Please don't

930
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,320
I learned it all from him

931
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,360
You take on the characteristics of those closest to you

932
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,880
Both of you are sly as foxes

933
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,040
Zhong Pu

934
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,000
Master Cai

935
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,040
Mr Cai

936
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,160
Quickly

937
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,200
Inside

938
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,520
Brother Zhong Pu

939
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,800
Good news

940
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,160
Shou Chang

941
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,320
Shou Chang, you still remember me

942
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,880
Mr Cai, what good news do you bring

943
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,720
Duan Qi Rui approved of our idea

944
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
he wants Peking University's professor's union

945
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,200
to quickly hold talks with the British embassy

946
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,880
To resolve Ke De Lai's issue

947
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,520
Alright

948
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,200
Also, Fu Zeng Xiang mentioned

949
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,800
Duan Qi Rui emphasised that

950
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
He does not want Peking University students

951
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,520
to protest in the streets

952
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,200
or to attack the embassy

953
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,880
and to avoid confrontations with the foreigners

954
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,760
Wang Da also mentioned just now

955
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,240
He wants us to quickly prepare the materials for the talks

956
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
He has arranged to meet with Zhu Er Dian

957
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,080
Now the materials and evidence have been prepared

958
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,080
The backup team will be led by Deng Zhong Xia

959
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
together with Fu Si Nian and Zhang Luo

960
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,440
The students are very enthusiastic

961
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,840
Just that those involved in the talks

962
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,960
I am still thinking of who should go

963
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
At first I was thinking that She Zhi,

964
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
Shou Chang and I will be a group

965
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,600
She zhi will be the main speaker

966
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
Shou Chang will be in charge of the materials

967
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,120
This is wonderful

968
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,600
Brother Zhong Pu

969
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
I have a small suggestion

970
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:07,920
Please share

971
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
See if you can get Gu Hong Ming to join

972
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
His English is good

973
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,440
and another reason

974
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,240
Hong Ming has influence overseas

975
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,640
Especially those foreigners in China

976
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,480
They respect him a lot

977
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,160
We did think about that

978
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,680
But we thought he was too eccentric

979
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,800
He has many idiosyncrasies

980
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
We are afraid he will not agree to come

981
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,640
and also that he will come and make a scene

982
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,960
It seems that you don't know Gu Hong Ming

983
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,400
He really

984
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,040
Detests those arrogant foreigners

985
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
If he gets wind of this matter

986
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,600
He will be receptive

987
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,360
He will spare no effort in the talks

988
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,640
He has experience

989
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
and he will definitely be enthusiastic

990
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,280
Of course he has his quirks

991
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,640
He likes to keep score

992
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,120
When you go to invite him

993
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,960
please humble yourself and say some flattering words

994
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,760
Zhong Pu, if you treat him to a meal

995
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,000
If he has any requests

996
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,000
try your best to fulfill them

997
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,920
Alright, I will try

998
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,920
Be or not to be

999
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,000
That is the question

1000
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,920
Whether it is noble to suffer the stings and arrows of misfortune

1001
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,280
Or to take arms against a sea of trouble

1002
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
And die

1003
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Opposing end them

1004
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,400
This is what the great British writer

1005
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,240
Shakespeare wrote in "Hamlet"

1006
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,720
A famous monologue

1007
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,960
and the Danish Prince Hamlet's

1008
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,520
Reflection on his life and destiny

1009
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
I want to ask all the students seated

1010
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,400
Who has thought about such issues

1011
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,920
You should seriously reflect on this question

1012
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,960
Because the answer to this will be you life's purpose

1013
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,200
With the correct life purpose

1014
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,760
your life will have a direction

1015
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,400
you will have a bright future

1016
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,800
We study English poems

1017
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,240
and the English language

1018
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,600
to be able to expouse Chinese values

1019
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,880
and our gentle yet meaningful poems

1020
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,040
to far flung lands

1021
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Those who cannot remember will continue to stand

1022
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,360
Thank you Professor

1023
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,920
Good Day

1024
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Bye Teacher

1025
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
Sir

1026
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,840
Guests?

1027
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,240
Professor Gu

1028
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,200
Are you here to learn English?

1029
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,320
Or

1030
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,280
Professor Gu, we are here to seek you as a master

1031
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,520
How interesting

1032
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,760
You speak in the vernacular language

1033
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,400
Yet come here to learn English poems

1034
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,360
Doesn't make sense
