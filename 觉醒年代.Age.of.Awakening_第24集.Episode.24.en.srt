to advocate a new culture

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
that subverts Confucius and Mencius' ethics,

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,320
disturbs moral thought,

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
and endangers social order.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,520
Here are three agendas.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,640
First, the sponsor explains the proposal.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,720
Second, the debate session.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,880
Third, the congressmen vote.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,160
First of all, let's invite the first signatory of the proposal

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,640
Yi Kuilong to make a proposal explanation.

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,960
Where's Yi Kuilong?

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,640
He's not here.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,240
Where's Yi Kuilong?

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
He's not coming, is he?

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Congressman Zhang Changli.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
Why didn't Congressman Yi Kuilong

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,600
show up in the meeting?

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,640
He really didn't come!

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,200
Congressman Yi Kuilong

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,920
must meet attend to an unexpected matter

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
leading to his absence.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,560
We used to meet situations like this

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,120
very often.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,960
I think that although the sponsor was not present,

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,600
the proposal has not been withdrawn.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,640
That is to say, the proposal can still be valid,

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
we will not affect the voting on the proposal.

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,440
Agree!

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,360
Let's vote!

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
Vote! Vote! Vote!

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,080
We have to wait for the congressman.

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,880
We can't vote now.

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,920
Yi is not here!

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
Everyone,

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
Congressman Yi may not be able to come because of something urgent.

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,880
The second sponsor, Congressman Zhang Changli

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
proposed to ignore the proposal description

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
and the inquiry

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,880
and go directly to the vote.

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
What's your opinion?

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
Mr. Speaker, I protest.

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
It is a formal notice issued by

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
the Senate of the country

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,240
asking me to answer the question.

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
Now if you

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
cancel the inquiry casually,

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,520
you actually take the dignity of the country

61
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
and personality of citizens as jokes.

62
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
I cannot accept!

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,800
I disagree with this!

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
He is right. We protest!

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,920
I think Mr. Cai Jiemin's protest

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
makes sense.

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
You want to impeach him.

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
But you don't let him participate in the debate.

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
What is the meaning of this?

70
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
It's called punishment without reason.

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
I won't agree.

72
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
Congressman Yi Kuilong, the first sponsor, was not present.

73
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,000
But the second sponsor, Congressman Zhang Changli, was present.

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,680
The proposal discreption and the debate

75
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
should be done by him.

76
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,720
Exactly!

77
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,520
Zhang Changli, you explain!

78
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
You explain!

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
Explain!

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
Explain!

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,720
Everyone!

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal

83
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
is mainly done by Congressman Yi Kuilong.

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
I just seconded it.

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
I can't proceed with the explanation.

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,480
I think the proposal itself

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,800
has explained the problem very clearly.

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,960
Especially, a lot of the content

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,160
has been published in major newspapers.

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,640
Its reliability is beyond doubt.

91
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
I think

92
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
we should vote without argument.

93
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,400
Vote! Vote! Vote!

94
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
No vote!

95
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,720
We must debate!

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,360
No vote!

97
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,480
We must debate!

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Vote and debate!

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Vote! Vote! Vote!

100
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Mr. Speaker,

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
I'd like to ask Mr. Zhang.

102
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,920
What evidence do you have to prove

103
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,640
the stories attacking President Cai Yuanpei

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,840
and professor Chen Duxiu on newspapers are true?

105
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
So many newspapers rushed to report

106
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
lengthy and tedious articles.

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,480
Is everyone faking it?

[Zhao Shiyan, styled Qinsheng, Student at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,160
I am not a student of Peking University.

110
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,840
But I was a reporter.

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
I've done a survey on this matter.

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,040
Most of the manuscripts attacking Peking University

113
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,760
are from a reporter named Cairen.

114
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
The real name of the so-called reporter Cairen

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,440
is Zhang Fengzai.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,280
This man is the nephew of Congressman Zhang Changli.

117
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
Congressman Zhang Changli, please explain this!

118
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
Explain!

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
And Zhang Fengzai!

120
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
Zhang Changli, explain!

121
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,160

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,640
I protest!

123
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,280
This is a shameless rumor and framing.

124
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
I want to sue him.

125
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,640
Shame on you!

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,400
What's your relationship?

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120

128
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720

retrieved the family backgrounds and personal information of members

of our work-study mutual aid society.

133
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,880
He also wrote articles anounymously to spread rumors and cause trouble

134
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
to frame Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Chen Duxiu

135
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
This is a fabrication! It's slander!

Do you have proof? Do you have proof?

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720

Sit down! Sit down!

You are here at a national chamber hall!

143
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
This is a sacred place.

144
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,880
Everything you say

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
must be proven with conclusive evidence.

146
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
I can confirm

147
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
that the testimonial of these two students is true.

148
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
Zhang Fengzai

149
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,960
is the founder

150
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,920
of "Shenzhou Ribao".

151
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,640
He not only wrote articles in order to

152
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
defame Peking University,

153
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,080
but also paid other reporters

154
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,760
to help him spread rumor.

155
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,960
This

156
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
is the article he sent me yesterday

157
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,120
together with this bribe.

158
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,280
In the press release he sent me, he said that

159
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,600
three professors Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, and Qian Xuantong

160
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,920
have been expelled from Peking University.

161
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,280
Now I want to ask

162
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
President Cai Yuanpei, is this a rumor?

163
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,280
Mr. Edward, let me tell you that

164
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
professor Chen Duxiu,

165
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,200
professor Hu Shi,

166
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
and professor Qian Xuantong

167
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
are sitting next to me right now.

168
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
They represent Peking University

169
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
and came here to be questioned.

170
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,760
So I tell you responsibly

171
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
that those things in your newspaper

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
are all lies

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
and rumors.

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
I also received the manuscript and bribe

175
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,640
of this Zhang Feizai

176
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Although I don't agree

177
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
with some of the ideas

178
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,400
put forward by "New Youth" and "The Renaissance",

179
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,360
as a journalist,

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,720
I firmly oppose the practice of bribing reporters for fake news.

181
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,160
I think

182
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,920
this is a challenge to journalists' moral bottom line.

183
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,200
I attest

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
that the reports about Peking University published by our newspaper

185
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,840
are paid by Zhang Feizai.

186
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,520
Look!

187
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,200
This is manuscript he offered us

188
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,280
on today's congressional inquiry.

189
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,040
It's the same with the manuscripts

190
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
the other two reporters are holding.

191
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
Zhang Changli, shame on you!

192
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
They are lying.

193
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
Don't trust them.

194
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,080
I'll beat you to death!

195
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,440
Slander!

196
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,040
Liar!

197
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,680
I'll beat you to death!

198
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,480
Shameless!

199
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
Liar!

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
Shameless!

201
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
We must stop this mess.

202
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,800
Let's finish the meeting.

203
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,680
OK

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Since Yi Kuilong is absent for some reason,

205
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,680
today's question will be dismissed.

206
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,440
No, it won't!

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,800
Yi Kuilong is here.

208
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,960
My dad is here!

209
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,760
He's here! Mr. Yi is here!

210
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,520
Brother Kuilong!

211
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Dear Mr. Speaker.

212
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
Dear congressmen.

213
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm sorry that I'm late.

214
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
Brother Kuilong,

215
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,080
we were just waiting for you to explain the proposal.

216
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
Now Congressman Yi Kuilong,

217
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,520
please explain the proposal to impeach Cai Yuanpei.

218
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,520
Dear congressmen,

219
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,080
I'm not here to explain the proposal today.

220
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
I'm here to apologize to Mr Cai Yuanpei.

221
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
I was so confused for a moment

222
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,120
and

223
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
deceived by Zhang Changli

224
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,680
that I signed my name

225
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,040
on the proposal wrote by Zhang Changli

226
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,320
to impeach President Cai and expel Chen Duxiu.

227
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
I became cannon fodder for him.

228
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
Here today,

229
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,960
I formally apologize to Education Minister Fu Zengxiang,

230
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
to Mr. Chen Duxiu, to President Cai.

231
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,320
I'll directly express my apology to you three another day.

232
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,520
Yi Kuilong!

233
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
You eat your words and slander me.

234
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,600
Extremely shameless!

235
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
Shameless!

236
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,040
You are shameless.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
Ah, it's just because I miss my daughter so much

238
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
that I fell for your trick

239
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,720
to commit a terrible deed and frame good people.

240
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,880
I am really shameless.

241
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,000
Yi Kuilong!

242
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
What on earth are you doing?

243
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,080
Explain it to all of us!

244
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:00,560
Yeah!

245
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,227
Explain!

246
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:01,680
You have to explain!

247
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,320
Enlighten us!

248
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
Ladies and gentlemen.

249
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
Please allow me to talk about this matter.

250
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,640
My daughter Qunxian

251
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,720
is dissatisfied with the arranged marriage I gave her,

252
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,920
so she ran away from home.

253
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
I was very worried about her.

254
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,280
At this time,

255
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,720
Zhang Changli and his nephew ran to tell me that

256
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,160
my daughter has been bewitched by

257
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,640
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu.

258
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,960
She participated in the work-study mutual aid society initiated by Cai Yuanpei.

259
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,160
He also said

260
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
that this mutual aid society was controlled by foreign religions.

261
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,960
It was guided by doctrines

262
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,520
that dissolved family ties and practiced communist wife-sharing.

263
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,120
They also gave me many

264
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
newspapers and leaflets attacking President Cai and Mr. Chen.

265
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,400
They said if we don't bring down Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu,

266
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,280
my little girl will never return to her family.

267
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
Countless young people will be brought into the abyss of sin.

268
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,520
I only have one daughter Qunxian.

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
Bewitched by Zhang Changli,

270
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
out of anger, I swore a poison oath that

271
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
I will bring down Cai Yuanpei even at the price of dying.

272
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
In this way, I signed on the proposal

273
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
he already wrote.

274
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
I was an utter fool!

275
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Thanks to Mr. Zhang Shizhao's teaching,

276
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
I realized the truth.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,520
I am guilty to President Cai.

278
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
I apologise, Mr. Chen.

279
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,440
I am even more sorry to my daughter.

280
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
I'm here today to officially announce

281
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
that I withdraw this ridiculous proposal

282
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
and make a profound review to Congress.

283
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,240
Dad, you were amazing!

284
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,520
Zhang Changli is shameless!

285
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
Zhang Changli is shameless!

286
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,040
Zhang Changli is shameless!

287
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
Zhang Changli is shameless!

288
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
Zhang Changli is shameless!

289
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,120
Zhang Changli is shameless!

290
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Everyone, calm down!

291
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,120
Everybody, listen to me.

292
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
We invite Congressman Zhang Changli

293
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
to explain it to us, won't we?

294
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,200
Zhang Changli, you explain this!

295
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
Explain! Explain!

296
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
You have to explain all the thing to us clearly.

297
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
Everyone,

298
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,880
I do have an unshirkable responsibility for this matter.

299
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,920
This is my little nephew Zhang Fengzai.

300
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,360
Brother Changli!

301
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
He is a student of Peking University.

302
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
I mistakenly believed his evasive remarks.

303
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
At the same time, I was misled by Mr. Lin Shu's novels.

304
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,120
I was kind.

305
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,320
Good intentions but evil deeds.

306
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
I will reflect on myself.

307
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,280
I'm sorry, Speaker Tian.

308
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
More importantly, I sorry to

309
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,880
President Cai Yuanpei

310
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,880
and Professor Chen Duxiu who had been misunderstood,

311
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
to you all,

312
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
to Professor Li Dazhao,

313
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
Professor Hu Shi,

314
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,000
I apologize.

315
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,280
I agree with Yi's decision

316
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,200
that we withdraw the proposal.

317
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm shameful to have such stupid nephew.

318
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,240
I will punish him back home.

319
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,280
Uncle!

320
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,640
Brother Changli, brother Changli!

321
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,840
Uncle, uncle, brother Changli.

322
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
Hold on, hold on.

323
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,880
Take him to the hospital.

324
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,400
Severely punish Zhang Changli!

325
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
Severely punish Zhang Changli!

326
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:42,000
Severely punish Zhang Changli!

327
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,680
Since the proposal is withdrawn,

328
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,200
this meeting is now adjourned.

329
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,720
Wait!

330
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,720
You've slandered us enough.

331
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,640
What a farce!

332
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,240
It's time for us to say something.

333
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,560
Journalists and friends, don't get me wrong.

334
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,760
This is the Senate.

335
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,200
Not a free market.

336
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm sure you don't want to come here for nothing.

337
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,240
Don't you?

338
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm standing here today.

339
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
Please feel free to ask any questions.

340
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,600
Professor Chen Duxiu.

341
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,640
What is the relationship between

342
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,640
Peking University and New Youth?

343
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
"New Youth" is co-edited some professors

344
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,400
in Peking University.

345
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
But "New Youth"

346
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,040
is an independent magazine.

347
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
It has no affiliation with Peking University.

348
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
"New Youth"

349
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
is in the charge of its editorial department.

350
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
It has nothing to do with any other organizations.

351
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,560
Excuse me, Mr. Chen Duxiu.

352
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
Recently I've seen many articles and reports

353
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
that are not favorable

354
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,960
to "New Youth" magazine.

355
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,800
I want to know what you think about these accusations

356
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
and what did the magazine do

357
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,680
during the past three years.

358
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,440
Over the past three years,

359
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,520
"New Youth" is called destructive magazine by some people.

360
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
They say we destroy Confucianism,

361
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,360
destroy etiquette,

362
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,480
destroy the quintessence of the country,

363
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
destroy chastity,

364
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
destroy old ethics,

365
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,920
destroy old art,

366
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,960
destroy old religion,

367
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,000
destroy old literature,

368
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
destroy old politics.

369
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,280
For these,

370
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
of course, our edittors agree with them directly.

371
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,760
Why should we destroy these things?

372
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
Only because we promote Mr. Democracy

373
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
and Mr. Science, the two gentlemen.

374
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
In order to promote Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science,

375
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
we have to oppose the old ideas

376
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,600
and old literature.

377
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
What on earth has "New Youth" done in the past three years?

378
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,920
That is all.

379
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,800
From my point of view,

380
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,120
it's difficult or even dangerous

381
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
to protect democracy and science in China.

382
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,880
Will you insist on doing so, Mr. Chen?

383
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,080
OK.

384
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,840
From supporting the two gentlemen,

385
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,520
Westerners had suffered many violent events

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
and lost a lot of blood.

387
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science gradually

388
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
brought them from the darkness

389
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,040
into the light.

390
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
We now believe that

391
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,840
only these two gentlemen

392
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,680
can lead China out of darkness, politically, morally

393
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
and academically.

394
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
If supporting the two gentlemen incurs

395
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,040
persecution by reactionary governments,

396
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,040
involving social attacks and abuse,

397
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,560
then we will not resist.

398
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,400
Good!

399
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
I would like to ask Mr. Li Dazhao a question.

400
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,280
I've read a lot of articles written by you recently.

401
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
I feel that you are very interested in Marxism.

402
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,720
There are many praises for the October Revolution in Russia in your articles.

403
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I want to ask Mr. Li.

404
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,040
Are you a follower of Marxism?

405
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,640
As a reader who pursues the truth

406
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I won't hide my views at all.

407
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Although my knowledge of Marxism

408
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,920
is still superficial.

409
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,200
But I think

410
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,400
Marxism

411
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
is the most scientific theory in the world.

412
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,040
The social system based on Marxism

413
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,160
created after Russian October Revolution

414
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,680
is, so far,

415
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,880
the highest system of human social system.

416
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
Thus, I am fascinated by this.

417
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,160
Good.

418
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,880
Mr. Chen,

419
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
I know you are advocating the New Culture Movement.

420
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
I really want to know,

421
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,320
what kind of impact do you expect

422
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
the New Culture Movement will have

423
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,520
to the development of Chinese society.

424
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
I get the general idea.

425
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,920
The influence of New Culture Movement on China,

426
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,560
of course, is not limited to culture.

427
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,320
Its inflence on industry should

428
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
make the workers

429
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,480
realize their own position,

430
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
make capitalists regard laborers

431
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,240
as their kind,

432
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
instead of viewing them as machines, animals,

433
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,960
or slaves.

434
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,840
Its influence on politics

435
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
is to create new political ideas.

436
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,920
Not to be influenced by real politics.

437
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,000
What is real politics?

438
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,080
This is today's real politics.

439
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,680
A group of boring spectators with no food,

440
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
spreading rumors and causing trouble.

441
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,840
It has nothing to do with

442
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,440
people's life and political ideals.

443
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
The current reality is that politicians of all factions

444
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,840
who have soldiers of all factions

445
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,760
struggle for power and profit.

446
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,040
It's like dogs fighting for a bone.

447
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,160
Their competition is a dog's movement.

448
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,200
The New Culture Novement is a human movement.

449
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,680
We should only take the people's movement

450
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,915
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

451
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
to disperse the dog's movement.

452
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
We should not abandon our people's movement

453
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,880
to join their dog's movement.

454
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,320
Great! Great!

455
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,040
We won!

456
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,920
Great! Great!

457
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,720
We won!

458
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
We won!

459
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,000
We won! We won! We won!

460
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,320
Brother Zhongfu's speech in Congress

461
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
put aside "New Youth"

462
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
with Peking University.

463
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,960
In doing so, he considered the problem very comprehensively.

464
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,600
Actually, I know what he meant.

465
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,960
Now our "New Youth"

466
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,080
in the eyes of the government

467
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,600
is a scourge.

468
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,360
We can't tie ourselves up.

469
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,720
Putting aside their ties,

470
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,400
we can fight wholeheartedly.

471
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
Mr. Cai,

472
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,560
Lin Shu published his open letter

473
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
on "Gong Yan Bao".

474
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,440
He apologized to you.

475
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,800
What did he say?

476
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,160
This is how he explained it.

477
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,520
In recent years,

478
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,600
he has heard a lot of

479
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,360
words and deeds attacking old culture.

480
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,920
It's a little too much for him.

481
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,680
So in a rage,

482
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,760
he made a lot of false statements

483
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,760
which has brought bad effects on

484
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
you and Peking University.

485
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
He was sorry and hoped you would forgive him.

486
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,440
At the same time he insisted,

487
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,440
he insisted on opposing the new culture.

488
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,360
He also said,

489
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,760
he would fight for the rest of my life and stick to his ambition.

490
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
In his rest life, he won't stop fighting

491
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,760
until dissenters become silent.

492
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,560
Mr. Cai,

493
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,320
it seems that this old Mr. Lin

494
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
is an opponent worthy of our admiration.

495
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,120

Shenshu, what's wrong with your body?

501

Slight ailment.

502
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,840
Mr. Cai, I wrote a letter.

503
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,280
I wanted to give it to you.

504
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,760
Everyone is here today.

505
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,360
I'll read it to everyone.

506

Good.

507
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,960
To the chief-editor of "Gong Yan Bao",

508
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
I've read your articles published on the 18th about

509
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,000
the change of ideological trend in Beijing academic circles.

510
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,000
It's inconsistent with the facts.

511
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
Although I was a teacher in Peking University,

512
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,280
I don't socalize with others, because I have been ill for years.

513
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,480
I have little contact with other teachers in Peking University,

514
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,800
not to mention forming factions with them.

515

What's more, "National Heritage" monthly magazine

516
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,280
is initiated by liberal arts students.

517
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,160
Although it is aimed at preserving the quintessence of Chinese culture,

518
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,400
it does not intend to conflict with

519
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
"The Renaissance" or other magazines.

520
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,240
I would appreciate it if you can correct the false information.

522
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,920

560
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,280
The official announcement of the peace conference has arrived.

561
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
Let me read it to you.

562
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,280
To the Chinese delegation.

563
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,280
Two proposals made by your delegation

564
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
which requests abolishing the treaty

565
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:17,405
[Gu Weiju, styled Shaochuan, Ambassador to the United States]

566
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
signed by the Chinese and Japanese governments

567
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,240
on May 25th, 1915

568
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:21,160
[Wang Zhengting, styled Rutang, Plenipotentiary of the Southern Government]

569
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,360
and the exchange of letters and notes

570
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
for policies hoping for change,

571
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
are not within the authority of the Peace Conference.

572
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
At best, the summit will recognize

573
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,560
the importance of these two proposals

574
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,720
but it can't be settled in the peace conference.

575
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,200
We request the administration department of the League of Nations

576
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,640
pay attention to China's position

577
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,040
when it exercises its authority.

578
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,480
So both proposals were rejected.

579
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600
Then-

580
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
What are we still doing here?

581
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,960
Clemenceau also said

582
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,000
Japan representative Mu Ye asked

583
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,240
at the meeting of ten people this morning.

584
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,560
Japan should fully accept

585
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,640
Germany's leased land in Shandong

586
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
and he hoped the conference would support Japan's position.

587
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,480
About proposal for Japan,

588
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
Mr. Williams, consultant of American delegation, suggested

589
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,880
the Chinese representative should be invited

590
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,200
to attend the debate meeting at three o'clock this afternoon

591
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,520
and state China's position.

592
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,040
We stand a chance.

593
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,800
So this American

594
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,880
is kind of reliable.

595
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
The Secretary General of the Peace Conference has sent the Chinese delegation

596
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
an official invitation to the meeting.

597
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,600
Two people can attend the meeting.

598
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
Only one of them has the right to speak.

599
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,680
The government requests

600
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,520
that Ambassador Gu and I attend the meeting.

601
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,840
Ambassador Gu speaks.

602
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,800
I agree.

603
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
Do you have any comments?

604
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,520
Then please, you two.

605
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,960
Since everyone is okay with it,

606
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,320
then we two will do it.

607
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,800
In 1919,

608
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,760
the victorious countries held a peace conference in Paris.

609
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,560
On this peace conference controlled by

610
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,560
the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Italy,

611
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,200
the world order was redefined.

612
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,440
The rights and interests of Jiaozhou Bay, Shandong Province, China

613
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,160
obtained by Germany before the war,

614
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
became the focus of disputes between China and Japan.

615
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,960
The Japanese delegation proposed

616
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Japan should inherit German rights and interests.

617
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,200
Chinese representative Gu Weijun argued strongly on just grounds

618
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,120
and refuted Japan's demands one by one.

619
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,320
He pointed out

620
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,720
that both in terms of Shandong's history,

621
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,160
geography and culture

622
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,400
and in terms of China's status

623
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,320
as a victorious power over Germany,

624
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,000
Jiaozhou's leased land,

625
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
Jiaozhou's railway,

626
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,800
and all other rights,

627
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,800
should be returned to China directly.

628
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,080
But the pro-Japanese faction

629
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,680
such as Cao Rulin in the Beiyang government,

630
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,040
under Japanese pressure,

631
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,840
said the move was purely unauthorized.

632
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,920
Gu Weijun's speech

633
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
caused great dissatisfaction in the Japanese government,

634
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:29,280
ordering its ambassador to China, Obata Yukichi,

635
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
to put pressure on the Beiyang government.

Mr. Bo.

639
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
I really have one thing

640
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,520
that I don't know what to do with it.

641
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,360
So I come to ask for advice.

642

[Chen Lu, styled Renxian, Acting Foreign Minister]

643
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480

[Wang Daxie, styled Botang, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Republic of China]

645

You're scared.

646
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,400
What did Obata say?

647
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,600
Obata said

648
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,920
Gu Weijun is going to announce the secret agreement between China and Japan

649
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,000
in the French press conference.

650
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,680
He was ordered

651
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,240
to ask the Chinese government to call the delegation

652
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,760
and ask them speak and act cautiously.

653
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,880
They were really dissitified

654
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
by the performance of the Chinese delegation in Paris

655
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,280
and make a solemn protest,

signed by Zhang Zongxiang on 1918.

660

In fact, this matter is easy to solve.

661
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,760
Some people in the government are afraid of Japan.

662
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,680
Chinese people are not afraid of Japan.

and never betray our country.

Dear delegates,

680
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,760
all the students in Peking University in recent days

681
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,120
heard your brilliant debate at the peace conference

682
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,000
to ask for our rights and interests in Shandong.

683
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,520
We are deeply excited.

684
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,880
Your performance

685
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,560
is an example for young Chinese students.

686
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,600
Recently, there was a Japanese ambassador

687
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,240
breaking into our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to scare us.

688
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,120
We hope that all delegates will bear the pressure

689
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,560
and never allow Japan to occupy Shandong.

690
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,960
The Shandong and Qingdao problem

691
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,640
concerns the survival of our country.

692
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,680

in order to better organize everyone

698
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,560
and make everyone know the truth of the situation timely.

699

713
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,200
The peace conference in Paris

714
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,520
is an international conference

715
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,040
that China attended as a victorious country.

716
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
As it is an international conference,

717
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,520
countries safeguard their national interests at the meeting

718
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,680
and put forward their correct positions.

719
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,160
It is the important principle that independent countries should have.

720
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,480
There is no reason for other country to interfere.

721
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
But just because

722
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
our envoy Gu Weijun

723
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720

appealing at the Paris Peace Conference

to recover our rights and interests in Shandong,

727

Students, would you say

728
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,800
can our 400 million Chinese compatriots

729
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,880
agree with this?

730
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
Never!

731
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,240
At this conference advocating international justice,

732
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,280
we have put forward the correct proposition of our country.

733
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,000
The Japanese rushed into our Foreign Ministry

734
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,680
to threaten us,

735
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,600
to knuckle under them!

736
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,240
Students, would you say

737
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,720
can our 400 million Chinese compatriots be intimidated by them?

738
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,520
Never!

740
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,040
to intimidate us

741
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
into giving up the rights and interests of Shandong.

742
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,360
Students!

743
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,680
Would you say, can we give in because of that?

744
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,480
Are you afraid of that?

745
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
Never! Never! Never!

746
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:32,970
[Hôtel Lutetia, Paris]

747
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,640
This Wang Daxie sends three telegrams a day

748
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,320
asking me to get back to Paris.

749
00:36:35,272 --> 00:36:38,823
[Lu Zhengxiang, styled Zixin, Head of the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference]

750
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
What's going on here?

751
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,400
What's the matter?

752
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,920
Chief Lu, nothing big happened.

753
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
But there are some important things you need to decide.

754
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,920
The Request for Abolition of the Treaty

755
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,560
signed by the Chinese and Japanese governments on May 25, 1915

756
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
and the Exchange of Notes

757
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,520
on the Conditions of Hope has been rejected.

758
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,280
Do you want to send it again after being rejected?

759
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,160
There is no agreement.

760
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,280
I can't coordinate, so I have to ask you to come out.

761
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,840
I read the post on Shandong problem.

762
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,120
In my opinion, posts about Shandong

763
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
and secret agreements on the Shandong problem signed by China and Japan.

764
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,280
Let's put it on hold.

765
00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:15,266
[Hu Weide, Chinese Ambassador to France]

766
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,440
Don't send it to the peace conference for the time being.

767
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,400
It is advisable to wait until the Japanese side agrees to deliver it.

768
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,080
Ambassador Hu really is

769
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,920
frightened by the Japanese ambassador.

770
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,680
I'm also thinking of the country.

771
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,760
If the Japanese do appeal to arms,

772
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,080
then the situation will be difficult to clean up.

773
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
Besides, the government is still hesitating.

774
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,920
Let's take a long-term view.

775
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,800
A telegram has just arrived.

776
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,240
I wonder if you have seen it.

777
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
Since the intimidation of Japanese ambassador Obata

778
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
was published in the newspaper,

779
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
public sentiment in China is soaring.

780
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,400
They send telegrams to the delegation.

781
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,880
I have received dozens of letters in the past few days.

782
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,360
All the articles are stressing the importance of recovering Shandong with sincere words.

783
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,440
We are asked to resist the pressure.

784
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,240
This is the telegram just received

785
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,000
from students in Peking University.

786
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,320
They request us to refuse

787
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,400
Japan's demand for occupying Shandong.

788
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,080
Even young students know

789
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
the Shandong and Qingdao problem

790
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,080
concerns the survival of our country.

791
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,360
Why did Ambassador Hu hesitate?

792
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,960
My heart for my country is bright.

793
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,360
Don't you all understand?

794
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720
Xinwu, Shaochuan.

795
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,440
Everybody, listen to me.

796
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,080
We can never flatter the Japanese with the Shandong issue.

797
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,560
Now the participating countries

798
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,720
have expressed sympathy for us.

799
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
If we can't insist at this time

800
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,320
and compromise halfway,

801
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,040
China will lose its international reputation,

802
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,400
even if someone else is willing to help us.

803
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,200
What will we have then

804
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,120
to ask for help from other countries?

805
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,680
Comparing the two possible aftermaths,

806
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,360
my opinion is

807
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,120
send the post again.

808
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,800
Understood.

809
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,800
I-

810
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,840
I'm going to ask Wilson for help.

811
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,040
After Obata Yukichi scared the Beiyang government,

812
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,200
the Japanese delegation once again proposed at the peace conference

813
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,480
that Germany's rights and interests in Shandong, China

814
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,240
should be handed over to Japan.

815
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,200
While in order to limit Japan's

816
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
expansion momentum in East Asia,

817
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,560
Wilson, at the beginning of the peace conference

818
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,880
rejected Japan's request.

819
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,920
In the pre-Qin Dynasty, the philosophy of Mohism,

820
00:39:57,157 --> 00:40:00,908
[Peking University]

821
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,560
together with Confucianism, was known as a prominent school of thought.

822
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Mohism takes universal love as its core,

823
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
and the pivot point is the use of the virtues.

824
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,840
It has ten virtues. Let's have a look.

825
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,160
Love, not attack.

826
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,400
Ability, not status.

827
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,920
Respect Heaven, and spirits.

828
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,240
Refuse extravagance, don't accept fate.

829
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,400
Thrift in daily life, and burial.

830
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,440
Universal love is the core of Mohism.

831
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,960
The so-called universal love

832
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,360
includes the meaning of equality and fraternity.

833
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,920
Mohism asks the monarch and his subjects, father and his sons

834
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,040
and brothers

835
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,080
to be friendly to each other on the basis of equality.

836
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
They should love others as they love themselves.

837
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,000
And in its doctrine, in society,

838
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,200
if the strong bully the weak, the rich insult the poor,

839
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,120
dignitaries despise the poor,

840
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,600
it is because people don't love each other.

841
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,320
Sir, I don't understand one thing.

842
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,040
Easterners (=Japanese) and westerners are forcibly occupying our Shandong province.

843
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,800
This is a typical behavior of the strong bullying the weak

844
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,800
Is this also because that people don't love each other

845
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
as Sir mentioned?

846
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,800
Students.

847
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,760
Guo Xingang

848
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,440
raised a question in class today.

849
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,720
This is a good thing.

850
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,000
This proves that Guo Xingang has started to think.

851
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,760
But Guo,

852
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,920
your question is beside the point.

853
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,600
Today we are talking about ancient Chinese philosophy.

854
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,520
It's an academic issue.

855
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,840
What you said just now is a political issue.
