[The Age of Awakening]

00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,795
[Episode Twenty-four]

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
This morning's congressional inquiry session

4
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
The main topics to be discussed are

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,720
Submitted by Mr. Yi Yilong Zhang Changli

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,360
Severely punish Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
Indulge Chen Duxiu Hu Shi and others.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,200
Advocate a new culture

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
Covering Confucius and Mencius' ethics

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,320
Disturb moral thought

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
Proposals that endanger social order

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,520
There are three agendas.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,640
The sponsor explains the proposal.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,400
Inquiry debate

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,560
Inquiry theory

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,720
Inquiry debate

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,880
1. Members vote

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,160
First of all, please ask the first signatory of the proposal

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,640
Yi Long made a proposal explanation.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,960
Where's Yi Kuilong?

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,640
not be in

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,240
Where's Yi Kuilong?

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
He is not coming, is he?

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Mr. Zhang Changli

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
Mr yi yilong did not attend the meeting.

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,600
What is the reason for this?

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,640
Really didn't come

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,400
Mr. Yi Long

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,200
Mr yi yilong

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,920
There must be something special going on.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
Can't be present

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,560
In a situation like this

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Congress used to meet it all the time.

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,960
I think that although the sponsor was not present

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,600
But the proposal has not been withdrawn.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,640
That is to say, the proposal can still be valid

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
We don't affect the voting on the proposal.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,440
Right vote

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,360
Let's vote.

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
Voting voting

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,080
We have to wait for the senator

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,880
With what vote?

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,920
Nobody's here yet.

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
everyone

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
Councilman Yi Long may not be able to come because of something urgent.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,880
The second sponsor, Mr. Zhang Changli

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
Propose to ignore the proposal description.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
And inquiry theory.

49
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,880
Go directly to the vote.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
What objections do Members have?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
Mr. Speaker, I protest

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
An open Senate of the country

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
Issue a formal notice of

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,240
Let me answer the question.

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
Now it's casual.

56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
Inexplicably cancel the inquiry translation theory

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,520
This is to take the dignity of the country

58
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Play games with the personality of citizens.

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
I can not accept

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,800
Don't promise either.

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
You're right. We protest

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,920
I think Mr Cai Zimin's protest

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
It makes sense.

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
You want to impeach him?

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
And don't let him participate in the theory.

66
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
What is the meaning of this?

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
It's called punishment without teaching.

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
I won't agree.

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
Mr Yi Long, the first sponsor, was not present.

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,000
But the second sponsor, Mr. Zhang Changli, was present.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,680
It should be done by him

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
The proposal and the theory are.

73
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,720
exactly

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,520
Zhang Changli explained

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
Zhang Changli explained

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
Explanation

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
Explain.

78
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,720
everyone

79
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal

80
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
It's mainly done by Mr. Yi Yilong.

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
I just seconded it.

82
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
I can't make this explanation.

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,480
I think the proposal itself

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,800
The problem has been made very clear.

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,960
Especially a lot of content.

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,160
It has been published in major newspapers.

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,640
Its reliability is beyond doubt.

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
I think

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
Vote without argument.

90
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,400
Voting voting

91
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
No vote

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Must debate

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,360
No vote

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,920
Must debate

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000


96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,480
Must debate

97
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Voting debate

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Voting voting

99
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Mr. Speaker

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
I'd like to ask this Member Zhang.

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,920
What evidence do you have to prove it?

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,640
The newspaper attacked President Cai Yuanpei.

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,840
And professor Chen Duxiu's content is true.

104
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
So many newspapers rushed to report.

105
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
lengthy and tedious

106
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,480
Is everyone faking it?

107
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,160
I am not a student of Peking University.

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,840
But I was a reporter.

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
I've done a fragrance check on this matter.

110
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,040
Attack the vast majority of Peking University's manuscripts.

111
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,760
It's all from a reporter named trample on people.

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
This reporter named trampling on people

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,440
His real name is Zhang Fengzai.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,280
This man is the nephew of Councillor Zhang Changli.

115
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
Please ask Congressman Zhang Changli to explain.

116
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
Please explain to Congress.

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
And Zhang Fengzai.

118
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
Zhang Changli explained

119
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,160
Zhang Changli explained

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,640
protest

121
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,280
This is a shameless rumor and framing.

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
I want to sue him.

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,640
You still have reason.

124
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,400
What's your relationship?

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
Zhang Fengzai explained

126
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
I can prove it.

127
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Zhang Changli's nephew Zhang Fengzai

128
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
By means of repeated deception

129
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
Get our work-study mutual aid society.

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
Family background and personal data of members

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,880
He also wrote a famous article to spread rumors and cause trouble.

132
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
Frame Mr. Cai Yuanpei Chen Duxiu

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,680
It's planted. It's

134
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:15,840
It's stolen goods.

135
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,240
It's a plant.

136
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,320


137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,680
It's spoiling. It's slander.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,920
Do you have proof? Do you have proof?

139
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
Ask them if they have any evidence.

140
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
solemnly still

141
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Be quiet

142
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,680
solemnly still

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
Sit down.

144
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,760
You are here at the National Conference Hall.

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
It is a sacred place.

146
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,880
Everything you say.

147
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
There must be conclusive evidence.

148
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
I can prove it.

149
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
The speeches of the two students are true.

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
This Zhang Fengzai

151
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,960
It is Shenzhou Daily.

152
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,920
Founder of Half Valley Newsletter

153
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,640
Not only did he step on people himself.

154
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
Write articles to discredit Peking University.

155
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,080
And pay for other journalists.

156
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,760
Help him publish and spread rumors.

157
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,960
this

158
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
It was he who had it delivered to me yesterday.

159
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,120
And commission.

160
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,280
Besides, the press release he gave me said

161
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,600
Chen Duxiu Hu Shi, three professors from Qian Xuantong

162
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,920
Has been expelled from Peking University.

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,280
Now I want to ask

164
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
Principal Cai Yuanpei, is this a rumor?

165
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,280
Mr Edward, let me tell you something.

166
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
陈独秀教授

167
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,200
Professor Hu Shi

168
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
Professor Qian Xuantong

169
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
Sitting next to me right now.

170
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
They represent Peking University.

171
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
Come here to be questioned.

172
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,760
So I tell you responsibly.

173
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
Those things in your newspaper now

174
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
It's all lies

175
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
And it's a rumor

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
I also received this Zhang Gongzi.

177
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,640
Red envelopes and manuscripts from here.

178
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Although I don't agree.

179
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
New Youth and New Tide

180
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,400
Put forward some ideas

181
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,360
But as a journalist

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,720
I firmly oppose the practice of spending money on news.

183
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,160
I think

184
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,920
This is a challenge to journalists' moral bottom line.

185
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,200
I prove

186
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
The report about Peking University published by our newspaper

187
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,840
Zhang Fengzai paid for them all.

188
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,520
Look

189
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,200
This is what he offered us.

190
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,280
Manuscript on today's congressional inquiry

191
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,040
And the contributions provided by these two journalists.

192
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
Is the same.

193
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
Zhang Changli you are shameless.

194
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
They are lying.

195
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
Don't trust them.

196
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,080
beat you to death

197
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,440
cook up a story

198
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,040
tell a lie

199
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,680
beat you to death

200
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,480
shameless

201
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
tell a lie

202
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
Shameless

203
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
We can't make this noise any longer.

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,800
Let's finish the meeting.

205
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,680
Ba San ba

206
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Since Yi Long is absent for some reason

207
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,680
Then today's question will be dismissed.

208
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,440
Can't dismiss

209
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:55,600
Yi long zai zhe

210
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:55,840
Yi Kuilong is here.

211
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,800
Yi long zai zhe

212
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,960
My dad is here.

213
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Coming. mr. yi is coming.

214
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,520
Long Xiong

215
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Dear Mr. Speaker

216
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
Dear Members of Parliament

217
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm late.

218
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
Long Xiong

219
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,080
Just waiting for you to explain the proposal.

220
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
Now please, Mr. Yi Long

221
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,520
Explain the proposal to impeach Cai Yuanpei

222
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,520
Members of Parliament

223
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,080
I'm not here to explain the proposal today.

224
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
I'm here to plead guilty to Mr Cai Yuanpei.

225
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
Because I was confused for a moment

226
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,120
Ghost lost his heart

227
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Be deceived by Zhang Changli.

228
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,680
It was written in Zhang Changli.

229
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,040
On the proposal of impeaching President Cai to expel Chen Duxiu

230
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,320
I signed it.

231
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
As cannon fodder for him.

232
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
Here today.

233
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,960
I formally submit to the Minister of Education of Fu Zengxiang

234
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
To Mr. Chen Duxiu, President Cai

235
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,320
Another day, I'll pay you a courtesy call.

236
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,520
Yi kuilong

237
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
You've gone back on your word.

238
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,600
Extremely shameless

239
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
shameless

240
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,040
You are shameless.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
Ah, it's just because I miss women badly.

242
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
I was taken in by you.

243
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,720
Did a bad thing to frame Zhongliang.

244
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,880
I'm really shameless

245
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,200


246
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,280


247
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,000
Yi kuilong

248
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
Which one did you sing?

249
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,080
Explain it to all of us.

250
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,680
explain away

251
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,320
make it clear

252
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
Ladies and gentlemen

253
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
Please allow me to talk about this matter.

254
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,640
Xiaoqunxian

255
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,720
Dissatisfied with the arranged marriage I gave her

256
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,920
run away from home

257
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm in a hurry.

258
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,280
At this time

259
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,720
Zhang Changli and his nephew ran to tell me that

260
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,160
The little girl has suffered.

261
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,640
Cai Yuanpei's "bewitched by Chen Duxiu"

262
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,960
Participated in the work-study mutual aid society initiated by Cai Yuanpei.

263
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,160
Also said

264
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
This mutual aid society is controlled by foreign religions.

265
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,960
Eliminate family and communist hetaerism.

266
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,520
The doctrine of losing human relations

267
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,120
They also gave me a lot.

268
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
Newspapers and leaflets attacking President Cai and Mr. Chen

269
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,400
If we don't bring down Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu

270
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,280
My little girl will never return to her family.

271
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
Countless young people will be brought into the abyss of sin.

272
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,520
I'm the only daughter in the group.

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
Listen to the bewitch of Zhang Changli.

274
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
In a fit of pique, I swore a poison oath.

275
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
Desperate to bring down Cai Yuanpei.

276
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
In this way, I am in what he has already written

277
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
Sign the proposal.

278
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
I did a stupid thing.

279
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Thanks to Mr. Zhang Shizhao's teaching regret.

280
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
That's the truth.

281
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,520
I am ashamed of President Cai.

282
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
I am ashamed of Mr. Chen.

283
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,440
I am even more ashamed of my daughter.

284
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
I'm here today to officially announce

285
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Withdraw this ridiculous proposal.

286
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
And make a profound review to parliament.

287
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,240
Dad said it well.

288
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,520
Zhang Changli is shameless

289
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
Zhang Changli is shameless

290
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,040
Zhang Changli is shameless

291
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
Zhang Changli is shameless

292
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
Zhang Changli is shameless

293
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,120
Zhang Changli is shameless

294
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Everybody take it easy.

295
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,120
Everybody, listen to me.

296
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
We invite Mr. Zhang Changli

297
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Can you explain it to us?

298
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,200
Zhang Changli explained

299
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
Explain

300
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
Explain what situation clearly.

301
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
everyone

302
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,880
I do have an unshirkable responsibility for this matter.

303
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,920
This is my little nephew Zhang Fengzai.

304
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,360
Brother Changli

305
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
He is a student of Peking University.

306
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
I mistakenly believed his evasive remarks.

307
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
At the same time, he was misled by Mr. Lin Lao's novels.

308
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,120
I was kind.

309
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,320
Good intentions do bad things.

310
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
I will review it with parliament.

311
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,280
Also to Speaker Tian of the Parliament.

312
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
What should be more apologetic is that

313
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,880
The wronged President Cai Yuanpei

314
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,880
陈独秀教授

315
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
To you

316
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
To professor Li Dazhao

317
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
Professor Hu Shi

318
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,000
apologize

319
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,280
I agree with Mr Yi Long.

320
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,200
Proposed decision to withdraw

321
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,280
Unfortunately, my family's family has this perverse son.

322
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,240
I'll go back and make a law to punish him.

323
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,280
Di-t

324
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,640
Brother Chang Li, brother Chang Li

325
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,840
Uncle, uncle, brother Chang Li

326
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
Hold on, hold on.

327
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,880
Take the hospital to the hospital.

328
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,400
Severely punish Zhang Changli

329
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
Severely punish Zhang Changli

330
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:42,000
Severely punish Zhang Changli

331
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,680
Since the proposal is withdrawn

332
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,200
The meeting is now adjourned.

333
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,720
wait a minute

334
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,720
You've ruined enough.

335
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,640
Enough noise, too.

336
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,240
Should we say something?

337
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,560
Journalists and friends, don't get me wrong.

338
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,760
This is the Senate.

339
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,200
Not a free market.

340
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm sure you don't want to come by yourself.

341
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,240
Nothing, huh?

342
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm standing here today

343
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
Please feel free to ask any questions.

344
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,600
陈独秀学长

345
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,640
Excuse me, Peking University and New Youth

346
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,640
What is the relationship?

347
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
"New Youth" is really written by Peking University.

348
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,400
Some professors practice peer editing.

349
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
But "New Youth"

350
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,040
It is an independent magazine.

351
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
It has no affiliation with Peking University.

352
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
"New Youth" All Bai's actions

353
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
All are in the charge of its editorial department.

354
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
Has nothing to do with any other unit.

355
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,560
Excuse me, Mr. Chen Duxiu

356
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
I've seen a lot recently.

357
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
Not conducive to New Youth magazine

358
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,960
Articles and reports

359
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,800
I want to know what you think of these criticisms.

360
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
And "New Youth" over the past three years

361
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,680
What on earth have you done?

362
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,440
Over the past three years

363
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,520
This journal is called destructive magazine by some people.

364
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
We say we destroy Confucianism.

365
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,360
Destroy etiquette

366
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,480
Destroy the quintessence of the country

367
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
Destroy chastity

368
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
Breaking the old ethics

369
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,920
Destroy old art

370
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,960
Destroy the old religion

371
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,000
Destroy old literature

372
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
Destroy old politics

373
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,280
For these

374
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
Of course, we people with the same ambition will recognize it directly.

375
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,760
Why should we destroy these things?

376
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
Only because we support Demokrasi.

377
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
And two gentlemen, Seines.

378
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
You should support Mr. and Mr. Sai.

379
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
You have to oppose the old ideas.

380
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,600
Old literature

381
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
What has Ben Zhi done in the past three years?

382
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,920
That's all.

383
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,800
in my opinion

384
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,120
Promoting democracy and science in present China

385
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
It's a difficult or even dangerous thing.

386
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,880
Will Mr. Chen insist?

387
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,080
good

388
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,840
Westerners support Desai, gentlemen

389
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,520
How many things have happened?

390
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
How much blood did you lose?

391
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
Mr. Desai and Mr. Desai gradually

392
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
Save them from the darkness.

393
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,040
To the bright world

394
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
We now believe that

395
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,840
Only two gentlemen Desai.

396
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,680
Can cure China politically and morally

397
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
All the darkness in academic thought.

398
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Because if you support two gentlemen

399
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,040
Persecution by all reactionary governments

400
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,040
Social attacks and abuse

401
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,560
We don't refuse

402
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,400
good

403
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
I would like to ask Mr. Li Dazhao a question.

404
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,280
I've read a lot of articles written by you recently.

405
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
You feel very interested in Marxism.

406
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,720
There are many praises for the October Revolution in Russia.

407
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I want to ask Mr. Li.

408
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,040
Are you a follower of Marxism?

409
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,640
As a reader who pursues the truth

410
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I won't hide my views at all.

411
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Although my knowledge of Marxism

412
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,920
Still superficial.

413
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,200
But I think ...

414
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,400
Marxism

415
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
Is the most scientific theory in the world.

416
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,040
Russian October Revolution

417
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,160
A social system based on Marxism

418
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,680
And so far.

419
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,880
The highest system of human social system

420
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
I am fascinated by this.

421
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,160
good

422
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,880
Mr. Chen

423
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
I know you are advocating the new culture movement.

424
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
I really want to know

425
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,320
You hope the new culture movement

426
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
To the development of Chinese society

427
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,520
What kind of impact will it have?

428
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
Probably understood.

429
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,920
Influence of New Culture Movement on China

430
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,560
Of course, it is not limited to culture.

431
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,320
The new culture movement affected the industry.

432
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
Workers should be awakened.

433
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,480
Their own position

434
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
Make capitalists turn laborers

435
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,240
Treat them as their kind.

436
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
Don't think of it as a robot.

437
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,960
Slave to look at

438
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,840
The new culture movement affected politics.

439
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
Is to create new political ideas.

440
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,920
Don't be influenced by real politics.

441
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,000
What is realistic politics?

442
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,080
Such as the current realistic politics.

443
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,680
That's a group of boring spectators with no food.

444
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
Where are rumors causing trouble?

445
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,840
And people's life and political ideals.

446
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,440
It doesn't matter.

447
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
But politicians of all factions.

448
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,840
Have soldiers of all factions.

449
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,760
Struggle for power and profit

450
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,040
It's like a dog fighting for a bone

451
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,160
Their competition is dog's sport.

452
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,200
The new culture movement is a human movement.

453
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,680
We should only take people's sports.

454
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
To disperse the dog's movement.

455
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
We should not abandon our people's movement.

456
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,880
To join their dog's movement.

457
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,320
Okay, okay, okay.

458
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,040
win

459
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,920
Okay, okay, okay.

460
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,720
win

461
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
We won

462
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,000
We won, we won, we won

463
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,320
Brother Zhongfu's speech in the parliament

464
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
He put "New Youth"

465
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
To put aside the relationship with Peking University.

466
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,960
In doing so, he considered the problem very comprehensively.

467
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,600
Actually, I know what he meant.

468
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,960
Now let's "New Youth"

469
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,080
In the eyes of the government

470
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,600
Is a scourge.

471
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,360
We can't tie ourselves up.

472
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,720
Put aside the relationship.

473
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,400
We can let go of our fighting power.

474
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
Mr. Cai

475
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,560
In Lin's "Gong Yan Bao"

476
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
Published his open letter.

477
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,440
Apologize to you

478
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,800
What did he say?

479
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,160
This is how he explained it.

480
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,520
In recent years

481
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,600
Because I've heard a lot.

482
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,360
Weigh the words and deeds of the old culture

483
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,920
It's a little too much for him.

484
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,680
So in a rage

485
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,760
I made a lot of false statements.

486
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,760
Give it to Peking University.

487
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
Has brought a lot of bad effects.

488
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
He hoped you would forgive me.

489
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,440
At the same time he insisted

490
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,440
He insisted on opposing the new culture.

491
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,360
He also said

492
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,760
Fight for the rest of my life and stick to my ambition.

493
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
Will silence the tongue.

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,560
The dog didn't bark before it died.

495
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:52,720


496
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,360
The dog didn't bark before it died.

497
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,520
Don't behave like a dog.

498
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:53,760
Don't behave like a dog.

499
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,560
Mr. Cai

500
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,320
It seems that this old Mr. Lin

501
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
Is an opponent worthy of our admiration.

502
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,120
Caigong

503
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:05,920
Cai

504
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,200
Shenshu

505
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,560
Caigong

506
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
Uncle Shen, what's wrong with your body?

507
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,000
Slight ailment

508
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,840
Cai Gong wrote a letter.

509
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,280
I wanted to give it to you.

510
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,760
Everyone is here today.

511
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,360
Let's read it to everyone.

512
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,800
good

513
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,960
"Gong Yan Bao" is the leading writer.

514
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
Read your 18th newspaper.

515
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,000
A change of ideological trend in Beijing academic circles

516
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,000
More inconsistent with the facts.

517
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
Although the county people are the university chairs.

518
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,280
However, Luo Yu closed the door and thanked the guests.

519
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,480
Teachers in the school seldom contact with each other.

520
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,800
An-you-have-a-combination thing

521
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Another monthly magazine, National Heritage

522
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,280
Initiated by liberal arts students

523
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,160
Although preserving the quintessence of Chinese culture is Zongchang

524
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,400
亦非与《新潮》诸杂志

525
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,680
Argue with each other

526
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,080
Fight for each other

527
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,240
That is to say, praying for correction is the most important thing.

528
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,400
Liu Shipei qi

529
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,920
Cai and I have one more thing to declare.

530
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,960
Go ahead.

531
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,520
If Chen Zhongfu insists on his way,

532
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,920
Liu Shipei will fight him to the end.

533
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
Uncle Shen, I believe that with brother Zhongfu's character

534
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,800
I will fight with you to the end.

535
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,440
say goodbye to

536
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,360
All right, all right, we've said what we have to say.

537
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,160
I'm thinking.

538
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,720
Should we treat Zhang Fengzai as the mole?

539
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
Have made a statement.

540
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Mr. Cai

541
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
People like Zhang Fengzai

542
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,560
Peking University will never tolerate it.

543
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,520
Please, please

544
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,880
Councillor Zhang's coming here late at night is really glorious.

545
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,080
Please sit down, please sit down.

546
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,200
Please, please

547
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,320
Please sit down, please sit down.

548
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I wonder if Zhang has good tea for me.

549
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,240
No, no, no, no need.

550
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,160
No, no, please sit down.

551
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,040
Brother Jing Tan

552
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,920
Late night visits don't smell bad.

553
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,560
This is my nephew Zhang Fengzai.

554
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
I have something to report to you.

555
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,960
Uncle Wu is good.

556
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,480
Sit.

557
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
I've long heard about your great name

558
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,400
I heard that my good nephew was killed by an adulterer.

559
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,160
Forced to leave Peking University.

560
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,440
There are many people who cry out for you.

561
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,520
Actually, that's not true, Uncle Wu.

562
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Expelled

563
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,840
my worthy nephew

564
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,160
Gold shines everywhere.

565
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,280
The official announcement of the peace conference has arrived.

566
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
Let me read it to you.

567
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,280
Chinese delegation

568
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,280
Two proposals made by your delegation

569
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
That is, request abolition.

570
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
May 25th, 195

571
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,240
A treaty signed by the Chinese and Japanese governments

572
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,360
Exchange articles and posts

573
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
Hope condition post

574
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
Are not within the authority of the Peace Conference.

575
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
At best, the summit will recognize

576
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,560
The importance of these two proposals

577
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,720
But it can't be settled in peace.

578
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,200
Request the administration department of the Federation of Nations

579
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,640
When you can exercise your authority

580
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,040
Please pay attention to China's position.

581
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,480
So both proposals were rejected.

582
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600
Then we ...

583
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
What are you still doing here?

584
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,960
Monso also said

585
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,000
Japan represents Mu Ye.

586
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,240
At the meeting of ten people this morning.

587
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,560
Japan should fully accept

588
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,640
Germany's leased land in Shandong

589
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
And hopes and will support Japan's position.

590
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,480
Proposal for Japan

591
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
Mr Williams, consultant of American delegation, suggested

592
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,880
The Chinese representative should be invited.

593
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,200
Attend the debate meeting at three o'clock this afternoon.

594
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,520
And state China's position.

595
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,040
stand a chance

596
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,800
So this American

597
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,880
It's interesting enough

598
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
The Secretary-General of CPC has given the Chinese delegation

599
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
Send an official invitation to the meeting.

600
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,600
Two people will be listed.

601
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
Only one of them has the right to speak.

602
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,680
What the government means is

603
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,520
Please minister Gu attend with me.

604
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,840
Minister Gu spoke.

605
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,800
I agree

606
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
Do you have any comments?

607
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,520
Then please, you two.

608
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,960
Since everyone is okay with it

609
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,320
Then let's just let the two of us be reluctant.

610
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,800
Nineteen nine

611
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,760
The victorious country held a peace conference in Paris.

612
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,560
This time by Britain, France, America and Italy

613
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,560
At the meeting controlled by the Big Four

614
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,200
The world order has been redefined.

615
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,440
Originally, before the war, Germany

616
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,160
Obtain the rights and interests of Jiaozhou Bay, Shandong Province, China

617
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
It has also become the focus of disputes between China and Japan.

618
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,960
The Japanese delegation proposed

619
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Japan should inherit German rights and interests.

620
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,200
On behalf of Gu Weijun, China argued.

621
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,120
Refute Japan's demands one by one.

622
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,320
He pointed out

623
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,720
No matter from the history of Shandong

624
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,160
Geographical and cultural aspects

625
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,400
Or from China to Germany?

626
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,320
In terms of being a victorious country.

627
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,000
Jiaozhou leased land

628
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
Jiaozhou railway

629
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,800
And all other rights.

630
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,800
It should be returned to China directly.

631
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,080
But the Beiyang government

632
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,680
Pro-Japanese Cao Rulin, etc

633
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,040
Unde that pressure of Japan

634
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,840
Said the move was purely unauthorized.

635
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,920
Yi Jun's speech

636
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Caused great dissatisfaction in this government.

637
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,840
I ordered Xiao Xiji, Minister in China.

638
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,280
Then I ordered the Minister in China, Xiao Xun Xi Ji.

639
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
Put pressure on Beiyang government

640
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,160
chairman of the committee

641
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,480
great-uncle

642
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
The younger generation really has one.

643
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,520
I don't know what to do with it.

644
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,360
Come to ask for advice.

645
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480
I know that Japanese minister Koji has come here.

646
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,320
You're scared.

647
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,400
What did Xiao Yan say?

648
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,600
Xiao Yan said

649
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,920
Gu Weijun is going to give a French press conference

650
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,000
Announce the secret agreement between China and Japan

651
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,680
He instructed Takamoto.

652
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,240
Ask the Chinese government to call the delegation.

653
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,760
watch your step and mind what you are saying

654
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,880
They were impressed by the performance of the Chinese delegation in Paris.

655
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
Express special dissatisfaction

656
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,280
Make a solemn protest

657
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,400
And threatened to

658
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,680
Take 1918.

659
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,120
Zongxiang personally signed it.

660
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,600
The agreement on the Shandong issue between China and Japan was made public.

661
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,160
In fact, this matter is very powerful.

662
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,760
Some people in the government are afraid of Japan

663
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,680
Chinese people are not afraid of Japan.

664
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,280
Sell newspapers

665
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,480
Japan's Minister Koji

666
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:26,560

Never betray a country

675
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,840
Sell newspapers sell newspapers.

It is an example for young Chinese students.

695
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,600
Recently, there was a Japanese minister

696
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,240
Forcing my foreign ministry to scare me.

697
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,320
We hope that all delegates will be the best at pressing the party.

698
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,120
However, I hope that all delegates will bear the pressure.

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,560
Never allow Japan to occupy Shandong.

700
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,960

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,640

Development of the Paris Peace Conference

709
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,840
In order to better organize everyone

710
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,560
Let everyone know the truth of the situation for the first time.

711
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,480
At this gathering, we

712
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
More than ten student union officers were launched.

713
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,800
So as to unite with universities in Beijing.

714
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,240

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,600
We are both excited and scared.

718
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840

A peace conference in Paris

726
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,520
It's our first time in China.

727
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,040
An international conference attended as a victorious country.

728
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
So since it's an international conference

729
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,520
Countries safeguard their national interests at the meeting.

730
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,680
Put forward one's correct opinion.

731
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,160
It is the important principle that countries should be independent.

732
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,480
There is no reason for his country to interfere.

733
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
But just because

734
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
Our Gu Weijun Gu envoy.

735
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720

Appeal at the Paris Peace Conference

737
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,920
To recover our rights and interests in Shandong.

738
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,880
The Japanese actually asked to replace him.

739
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Boys and girls, say

740
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,800
Our 400 million Chinese compatriots

741
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,880
Can you promise?

742
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
cannot

743
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,240
At this conference advocating world fairness

744
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,280
We have put forward the correct proposition of our country.

745
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,000
The Japanese rushed into our Foreign Ministry.

746
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,480
The Present Continuous Tense

747
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:58,720
The Present Continuous Tense

00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,600
Carry out tongxia

753
00:35:59,680 --> 00:35:59,680


754
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,600
Force us into submission.

755
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,240
Boys and girls, say

756
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,720
Can our 400 million Chinese compatriots be intimidated?

757
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,520
cannot

758
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,760
Japan claims to have a million troops.

759
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,280
Japan claims to have the head of the army.

760
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,040
Be ready to fight.

761
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
To intimidate us into giving up the rights and interests of Shandong.

762
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,360
classmates

763
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,680
You said we could give in because of it.

764
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,480
Are you afraid of it?

765
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
No, no, no

766
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,640
This Wang Daxie sends three telegrams a day.

767
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,320
Let me get back to Paris.

768
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
What's the matter? This is

769
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,400
What's the matter

770
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,920
Chief Lu is not what's the big deal?

771
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
And there are important things you need to decide.

772
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,920
Request to abolish May 25th, 1915

773
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,560
A treaty signed by the Chinese and Japanese governments

774
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
Exchange articles and posts

775
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,520
Hope condition post

776
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,280
Do you want to send it again after being rejected?

777
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,160
There is no opinion in the regiment

778
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,280
I can't coordinate, so I have to ask you to come out.

779
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,840
I read the post on Shandong issue.

780
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,120
Signed with China and Japan

781
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
Various secret agreements on the Shandong issue

782
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,280
Let's put it on hold.

783
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,440
Don't send it to the peace conference for the time being.

784
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,400
It is advisable to wait until the Japanese side agrees to deliver it.

785
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,080
Minister Hu really is

786
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,920
Frightened by the Japanese minister.

787
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,680
I'm also thinking of the country.

788
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,760
If the Japanese do send troops

789
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,080
Then the situation will be difficult to clean up.

790
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
Besides, the government is still hesitating.

791
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,920
Let's take a long-term view.

792
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,800
A telegram has just arrived.

793
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,240
I wonder if you have seen it.

794
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
Minister from Japan

795
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
Since tung's scare was published in the newspaper.

796
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
The jade people are in high spirits.

797
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,400
Send telegrams to the delegation.

798
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,880
I have received dozens of letters in the past few days.

799
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,360
An article is painful and interesting, and words are willing to cut.

800
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,440
We ask to resist the pressure.

801
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,240
This is just received.

802
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,000
Telegrams from students in Peking University.

803
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,320
We must never agree to the request.

804
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,400
Japan's demand for occupying Shandong

805
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,080
Even young students know.

806
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
Shandong and Qingdao asked

807
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,080
It concerns the survival of our country.

808
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,360
Why did Minister Hu hesitate?

809
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,960
My heart for my country is bright.

810
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,360
Don't you all understand?

811
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720
Xin Wu Shao chuan

812
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,440
Everybody listen to me.

813
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,080
This matter must not please the Japanese.

814
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,560
Now the participating countries

815
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,720
Have expressed sympathy for us.

816
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
If we can't insist at this time

817
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,320
Soften halfway

818
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,040
Even if someone else is willing to help me.

819
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,400
It will also make our country lose its international reputation.

820
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,200
What will we have then?

821
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,120
Ask for help from other countries?

822
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,680
Two evils

823
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,360
My opinion is

824
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,120
Send a post again

825
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,800
be

826
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,800
I

827
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,840
I'll find Wilson.

828
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,800
After Xiaoyou Jitong scared the Beiyang government

829
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,040
After Mi Xiaopan Xiji scared the Beiyang government

830
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,520
After Xiao Pan You Ji scared the Beiyang government

831
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,200
The Japanese delegation once again proposed at the peace conference

832
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,480
To Germany's rights and interests in Shandong, China

833
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,240
Handed over to Japan

834
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,200
And Wilson in order to limit Ben

835
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
Expansion momentum in East Asia

836
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,560
At the beginning of the peace conference

837
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,880
Rejected Japan's request

838
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,920
Mohism in Pre-Qin Dynasty

839
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,560
Write Confucianism and call it outstanding.

840
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Mohism takes universal love as its core.

841
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Take saving Shang Xian as the fulcrum

842
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,840
There are ten propositions, please see.

843
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,160
Love and not attack

844
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,320
Shang Xian Shang Tong

845
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,400


846
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,040
Respect the ghost of heaven.

847
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,120


848
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,920
Respect the ghost of heaven.

849
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,240
Be happy and unhappy.

850
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,400
Festive burial

851
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,440
Universal love is the core of family theory.

852
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,960
The so-called universal love

853
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,360
It contains the meaning of equality and fraternity

854
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,920
Mohism asked the monarch, minister and son.

855
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,040
Between brothers

856
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,080
We should love each other on the basis of equality.

857
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
If a lover loves his body.

858
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,000
And think that in society

859
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,200
If there is a strong, weak, rich and poor regret

860
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,120
The phenomenon of high and low

861
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,600
Because people don't love each other.

862
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,320
Sir, one thing is unknown to the students.

863
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,040
Oriental people and westerners are dominating me, and Shandong won't pay me back.

864
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,800
This is a typical strong-willed behavior.

865
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,800
Is this what Mr. Wang said?

866
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
Don't people love what they do?

867
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,800
classmates

868
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,760
Guo Xingang classmate

869
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,440
I raised questions in class today.

870
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,720
This is a good thing.

871
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,000
Prove that Guo Xingang has started to think.

872
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,760
But classmate Guo

873
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,920
Today's question is beside the point.

874
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,600
Today we are talking about ancient Chinese philosophy.

875
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,520
It's an academic issue.

876
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,840
What you said just now is a political issue.
