00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,795
[Episode Twenty-four]

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
This morning's congressional inquiry session

4
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
The main topics to be discussed are

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,720
Submitted by Mr. Yi Yilong Zhang Changli

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,360
They proposed to severely punish Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
because he allowing Chen Duxiu Hu Shi and others

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,200
to advocate a new culture

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
which are subverting Confucius and Mencius' ethics

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,320
disturbing moral thought

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
and endangering social order.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,520
There are three agendas.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,640
The sponsor explains the proposal.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,400
Inquiry debate

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,560
Inquiry theory

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,720
Inquiry debate

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,880
1. Members vote

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,160
First of all, let's invite the first signatory of the proposal

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,640
Yi Long to make a proposal explanation.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,960
Where's Yi Kuilong?

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,640
He's not here.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,040
Where's Yi Kuilong?

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
He is not coming, is he?

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Mr. Zhang Changli

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
Why didn't Yi Kuilong

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,600
show up in the meeting.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,640
He really didn't come!

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,400
Mr. Yi Long

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,200
Mr yi yilong

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,920
He must meet something unexpected

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
leading to his absence.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,560
We used to meet situations like this

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,120
very often.

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,960
I think that although the sponsor was not present

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,600
But the proposal has not been withdrawn.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,640
That is to say, the proposal can still be valid

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
We don't affect the voting on the proposal.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,440
Agree

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,360
Let's vote.

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
Voting voting

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,080
We have to wait for the senator

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,880
We can't now.

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,920
Yi is not here!

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
everyone

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
Yi may not be able to come because of something urgent.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,880
The second sponsor, Mr. Zhang Changli

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
proposed to ignore the proposal description

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
and the inquiry

49
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,880
and go directly to the vote.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
What's your opinion?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
Mr. Speaker, I protest

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
It is a formal notice issued by

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
Senate of the country

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,240
asking me answer the question.

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
Now if you

56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
cancel the inquiry casually

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,520
you actually take the dignity of the country

58
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
and personality of citizens as jokes.

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
I can not accept!

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,800
I disagree with this!

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
He is right. We protest!

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,920
I think Mr Cai Zimin's protest

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
makes sense.

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
You want to impeach him.

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
But you don't let him participate in the debate.

66
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
What is the meaning of this?

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
It's called punishment without reason.

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
I won't agree.

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
Mr Yi Long, the first sponsor, was not present.

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,000
But the second sponsor, Mr. Zhang Changli, was present.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,680
The proposal discreption and the debate

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
should be done by him.

73
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,720
exactly

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,520
Zhang Changli,  you make the explanation!

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
You explain!

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
Explain!

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
Explain!

78
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,720
everyone

79
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal

80
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
is mainly done by Mr. Yi.

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
I just seconded it.

82
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
I can't make this explanation.

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,480
I think the proposal itself

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,800
has explained the problem very clearly.

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,960
Especially, a lot of the content

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,160
has been published in major newspapers.

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,640
Its reliability is beyond doubt.

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
I think

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
we should vote without argument.

90
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,400
Voting voting

91
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
No vote

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Must debate

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,360
No vote

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,920
Must debate

95
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,480
Must debate

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Voting debate

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Voting voting

98
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Mr. Speaker

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
I'd like to ask Mr. Zhang.

100
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,920
What evidence do you have to prove

101
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,640
the stories attacking President Cai Yuanpei

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,840
and professor Chen Duxiu on newspapers are true?

103
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
So many newspapers rushed to report.

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
lengthy and tedious

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,480
Is everyone faking it?

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,160
I am not a student of Peking University.

107
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,840
But I was a reporter.

108
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
I've done a survey on this matter.

109
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,040
Most of the manuscripts attacking Peking University

110
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,760
are from a reporter named Cairen.

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
The real name of the so-called reporter Cairen

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,440
is Zhang Fengzai.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,280
This man is the nephew of Councillor Zhang Changli.

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
Congressman Zhang Changli, please explain this!

115
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
Explain!

116
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
And Zhang Fengzai.

117
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
Zhang Changli explained

118
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,160
Zhang Changli explained

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,640
protest

120
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,280
This is a shameless rumor and framing.

121
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
I want to sue him.

122
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,640
Shame on you!

123
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,400
What's your relationship?

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
Zhang, explain!

125
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
I can prove it.

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Zhang Changli's nephew Zhang Fengzai

127
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
By means of repeated deception

128
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
Get the family backgrounds and personal data of members

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
of our work-study mutual aid society.

130
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,880
He also wrote articles anounymously to spread rumors and cause trouble.

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
to frame Mr. Cai Yuanpei Chen Duxiu

132
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,680
It's planted. It's

133
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:15,840
slander!

134
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,240
It's a set-up.

135
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,680
It's slander.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,920
Do you have proof? Do you have proof?

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
Ask them if they have any evidence.

138
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
solemnly still

139
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Be quiet

140
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,680
solemnly still

141
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
Sit down.

142
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,760
You are here at the National Conference Hall.

143
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
It is a sacred place.

144
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,880
Everything you say

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
should be proved with conclusive evidence.

146
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
I can confirm

147
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
the speeches of the two students are true.

148
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
Zhang Fengzai is the founder of

149
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,960
Shenzhou Daily.

150
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,920
and Half Valley Newsletter

151
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,640
He not only wrote articles in order to

152
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
difame Peking University.

153
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,080
but also paid other reporters

154
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,760
to help him spread rumor.

155
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,960
This

156
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
is the article he sent me yesterday

157
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,120
together with this bribe.

158
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,280
Besides, the press release he gave me said

159
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,600
three professors Chen Duxiu Hu Shi and Qian Xuantong

160
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,920
have been expelled from Peking University.

161
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,280
Now I want to ask

162
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
President Cai Yuanpei, is this a rumor?

163
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,280
Mr Edward, let me tell you that

164
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
professor Chen Duxiu

165
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,200
professor Hu Shi

166
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
and professor Qian Xuantong

167
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
are sitting next to me right now.

168
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
They represent Peking University.

169
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
Come here to be questioned.

170
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,760
So I tell you responsibly

171
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
those things in your newspaper

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
are all lies.

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
And it's a rumor

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
I also received the manuscript and bribe

175
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,640
of this Zhang Feizai

176
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Although I don't agree.

177
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
some ideas in

178
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,400
New Youth and New Tide,

179
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,360
as a journalist,

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,720
I firmly oppose the practice of bribing reporters for fake news.

181
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,160
I think

182
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,920
This is a challenge to journalists' moral bottom line.

183
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,200
I prove

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
The reports about Peking University published by our newspaper

185
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,840
are paid by Zhang Feizai.

186
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,520
Look

187
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,200
This is manuscript he offered us

188
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,280
on today's congressional inquiry

189
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,040
It's the same with the manuscripts

190
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
the other two reporters are holding.

191
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
Zhang Changli, shame on you!

192
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
They are lying.

193
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
Don't trust them.

194
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,080
Beat you to death

195
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,440
cook up a story

196
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,040
Lier!

197
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,680
beat you to death

198
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,480
shameless

199
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
lier

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
Shameless

201
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
We must stop this mess.

202
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,800
Let's finish the meeting.

203
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,680
OK

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Since Yi Long is absent for some reason

205
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,680
Then today's question will be dismissed.

206
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,440
Can't dismiss

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:55,600
Yi long is here.

208
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:55,840
Yi Kuilong is coming.

209
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,800
Yi long is here.

210
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,960
My dad is here.

211
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Brother Kuilong

212
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Dear Mr. Speaker

213
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
Dear congressmen

214
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm sorry that I'm late.

215
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
Brother Kuilong

216
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,080
Just waiting for you to explain the proposal.

217
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
Now Mr. Yi Long

218
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,520
please explain the proposal to impeach Cai Yuanpei

219
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,520
everyone

220
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,080
I'm not here to explain the proposal today.

221
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
I'm here to apologize to Mr Cai Yuanpei.

222
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
I was so confused for a moment

223
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,120
and

224
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
deceived by Zhang Changli.

225
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,680
that I signed my name

226
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,040
on the proposal wrote by Zhang Changli

227
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,320
of impeaching President Cai and  expelling Chen Duxiu

228
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
I became cannon fodder for him.

229
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
Here today.

230
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,960
I formally apologize to the Minister of Education of Fu Zengxiang

231
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
to Mr. Chen Duxiu, President Cai

232
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,320
I'll express my apology to you three respectively another day.

233
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,520
Yi kuilong

234
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
You ate your word and slandered me.

235
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,600
Extremely shameless

236
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
shameless

237
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,040
You are shameless.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
Ah, it's just because I miss my daughter

239
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
that I was taken in by you.

240
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,720
Did a bad thing to frame good people.

241
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,880
I'm really shameless

242
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,000
Yi kuilong

243
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
What on earth are you doing?

244
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,080
Explain it to all of us.

245
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,680
explain

246
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,320
make it clear

247
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
Ladies and gentlemen

248
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
Please allow me to talk about this matter.

249
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,640
My daughter Qunxian

250
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,720
is dissatisfied with the arranged marriage I gave her

251
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,920
So she ran away from home

252
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm very worried about her.

253
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,280
At this time

254
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,720
Zhang Changli and his nephew ran to tell me that

255
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,160
my daughter has been bewitched by.

256
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,640
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu

257
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,960
She participated in the work-study mutual aid society initiated by Cai Yuanpei.

258
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,160
Zhang also said

259
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
This mutual aid society is controlled by foreign religions.

260
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,960
It was guided by doctrines

261
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,520
that dissolved family ties and practiced communist hetaerism.

262
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,120
They also gave me many

263
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
newspapers and leaflets attacking President Cai and Mr. Chen

264
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,400
They said if we don't bring down Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu

265
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,280
My little girl will never return to her family.

266
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
Countless young people will be brought into the abyss of sin.

267
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,520
I only have one daughter Qunxian

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
Bewitched by Zhang Changli,

269
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
out of anger, I swore a poison oath that

270
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
I will bring down Cai Yuanpei even at the price of dying

271
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
In this way, I signed on the proposal

272
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
he already wrote.

273
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
I did a stupid thing.

274
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Thanks to Mr. Zhang Shizhao's teaching

275
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
I realized the truth.

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,520
I am guilty to President Cai.

277
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
Sorry, Mr. Chen.

278
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,440
I am even more sorry to my daughter.

279
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,780
I'm here today to officially announce

280
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,340
that I withdraw this ridiculous proposal.

281
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
And make a profound review to congress.

282
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,240
Dad, you did it well.

283
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,520
Zhang Changli is shameless

284
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
Zhang Changli is shameless

285
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,040
Zhang Changli is shameless

286
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
Zhang Changli is shameless

287
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
Zhang Changli is shameless

288
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,120
Zhang Changli is shameless

289
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Calm down

290
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,120
Everybody, listen to me.

291
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
We invite Mr. Zhang Changli

292
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
to explain it to us, won't we?

293
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,200
Zhang Changli, you explain this!

294
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
Explain

295
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
You have to explain all the thing to us clearly.

296
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
everyone

297
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,880
I do have an unshirkable responsibility for this matter.

298
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,920
This is my little nephew Zhang Fengzai.

299
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,360
Brother Changli

300
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
He is a student of Peking University.

301
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
I mistakenly believed his evasive remarks.

302
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
At the same time, I was misled by Mr. Lin Shu
s novels.

303
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,120
I was kind.

304
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,320
Good intentions do bad things.

305
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
I will reflect myself.

306
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,280
I'm sorry, Speaker Tian.

307
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
More importantly, I sorry to

308
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,880
President Cai Yuanpei

309
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,880
and professor Chen Duxiu who had been misunderstood.

310
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
To you

311
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
To professor Li Dazhao

312
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
Professor Hu Shi

313
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,000
apologize

314
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,280
I agree with Yi's decision

315
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,200
that we withdraw the proposal.

316
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm shameful to have such stupid nephew.

317
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,240
I will punish him back home.

318
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,280
Uncle

319
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,640
Brother Chang Li, brother Chang Li

320
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,840
Uncle, uncle, brother Chang Li

321
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
Hold on, hold on.

322
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,880
Take him to the hospital.

323
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,400
Severely punish Zhang Changli

324
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
Severely punish Zhang Changli

325
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:42,000
Severely punish Zhang Changli

326
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,680
Since the proposal is withdrawn

327
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,200
The meeting is now adjourned.

328
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,720
wait a minute

329
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,720
You've slandered us enough.

330
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,640
What a farce!

331
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,240
It's time for us to say something.

332
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,560
Journalists and friends, don't get me wrong.

333
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,760
This is the Senate.

334
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,200
Not a free market.

335
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm sure you don't want to come here for nothing.

336
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,240
do you?

337
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm standing here today

338
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
Please feel free to ask any questions.

339
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,600
Professor Chen Duxiu

340
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,640
What is the relationship between

341
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,640
Peking University and New Youth?

342
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
"New Youth" is co-editted some professors

343
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,400
in Peking University'.

344
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
But "New Youth"

345
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,040
It is an independent magazine.

346
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
It has no affiliation with Peking University.

347
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
"New Youth"

348
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
is in the charge of its editorial department.

349
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
it has nothing to do with any other organizations.

350
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,560
Excuse me, Mr. Chen Duxiu

351
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
Recently I've read many articles and reports

352
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
that are not favorable

353
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,960
to New Youth magazine.

354
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,800
I want to know what you think of these accusations.

355
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
and what did the magezine do

356
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,680
during the past three years.

357
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,440
Over the past three years

358
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,520
New Youth is called destructive magazine by some people.

359
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
They say we destroy Confucianism.

360
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,360
Destroy etiquette

361
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,480
Destroy the quintessence of the country

362
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
Destroy chastity

363
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
Break the old ethics

364
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,920
Destroy old art

365
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,960
Destroy the old religion

366
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,000
Destroy old literature

367
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
Destroy old politics

368
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,280
For these

369
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
Of course, our edittors agree with them directly.

370
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,760
Why should we destroy these things?

371
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
Only because we promote Democracy (Mr. DE)

372
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
and Science(Mr. Sai), the two "Gentlemen"

373
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
In order to promote Democracy and Science

374
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
we have to oppose the old ideas.

375
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,600
old literature

376
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
What on earth has Now Youth done in the past three years?

377
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,920
That's all.

378
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,800
From my point of view,

379
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,120
Promoting democracy and science in present China

380
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
It's a difficult or even dangerous thing.

381
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,880
Will Mr. Chen insist?

382
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,080
OK

383
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,840
Because of supportting Science and Democracy

384
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,520
Westerners had suffered many voilent events

385
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
lost a lot of blood.

386
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
Mr. Desai and Mr. Desai gradually

387
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
Save them from the darkness.

388
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,040
to the bright world.

389
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
We now believe that

390
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,840
Only two gentlemen

391
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,680
Can lead China out of darkness politically, morally

392
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
and acdemically

393
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
If supportting the two gentlemen incurs

394
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,040
Persecution by all reactionary governments

395
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,040
Social attacks and abuse

396
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,560
We don't refuse

397
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,400
good

398
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
I would like to ask Mr. Li Dazhao a question.

399
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,280
I've read a lot of articles written by you recently.

400
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
I feel that you are very interested in Marxism.

401
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,720
There are many praises for the October Revolution in Russia in your articles.

402
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I want to ask Mr. Li.

403
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,040
Are you a follower of Marxism?

404
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,640
As a reader who pursues the truth

405
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I won't hide my views at all.

406
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Although my knowledge of Marxism

407
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,920
is still superficial.

408
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,200
But I think ...

409
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,400
Marxism

410
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
Is the most scientific theory in the world.

411
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,040
The social system based on Marxism

412
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,160
created after Russian October Revolution

413
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,680
is, so far,

414
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,880
the highest system of human social system

415
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
I am fascinated by this.

416
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,160
good

417
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,880
Mr. Chen

418
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
I know you are advocating the new culture movement.

419
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
I really want to know

420
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,320
What kind of impact do you expect

421
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
the new culture movement will have

422
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,520
to the development of Chinese society

423
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
Generally got what you said.

424
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,920
Influence of New Culture Movement on China

425
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,560
Of course, it is not limited to culture.

426
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,320
Its inflence on industry should

427
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
make the workers

428
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,480
realize heir own position,

429
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
make capitalists regard laborers

430
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,240
as their kind.

431
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
instead of viewing them as machines, animals

432
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,960
or slaves.

433
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,840
Its influence on politics

434
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
is to create new political ideas.

435
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,920
Don't be influenced by real politics.

436
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,000
What is realistic politics?

437
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,080
This is the current realistic politics.

438
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,680
That's a group of boring spectators with no food.

439
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
spreading rumors and causing trouble?

440
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,840
It has nothing to do with

441
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,440
people's life and political ideals.

442
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
The current reality is that politicians of all factions

443
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,840
who have soldiers of all factions

444
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,760
struggle for power and profit

445
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,040
It's like a dog fighting for a bone

446
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,160
Their competition is dog's sport.

447
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,200
The new culture movement is a human movement.

448
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,680
We should only take people's movement

449
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
To disperse the dog's competition

450
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
We should not abandon our people's movement.

451
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,880
To join their dog's competition.

452
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,320
Great! Great!

453
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,040
We won.

454
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,920
Good. Good

455
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,720
We won

456
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
We won

457
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,000
We won, we won, we won

458
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,320
Brother Zhongfu's speech in the congress

459
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
put aside "New Youth"

460
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
with Peking University.

461
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,960
In doing so, he considered the problem very comprehensively.

462
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,600
Actually, I know what he meant.

463
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,960
Now our "New Youth"

464
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,080
In the eyes of the government

465
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,600
Is a scourge.

466
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,360
We can't tie ourselves up.

467
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,720
Putting aside their ties,

468
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,400
We can fight wholeheartedly.

469
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
Mr. Cai

470
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,560
Lin Shu published his open letter.

471
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
on Gong Yan Bao

472
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,440
He apologized to you

473
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,800
What did he say?

474
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,160
This is how he explained it.

475
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,520
In recent years

476
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,600
He has heard a lot of

477
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,360
words and deeds attacking old culture

478
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,920
It's a little too much for him.

479
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,680
So in a rage

480
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,760
He made a lot of false statements.

481
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,760
which has brought bad effects on

482
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
you and Peking University.

483
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
He was sorry and hoped you would forgive him.

484
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,440
At the same time he insisted

485
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,440
He insisted on opposing the new culture.

486
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,360
He also said

487
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,760
he would fight for the rest of my life and stick to his ambition.

488
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
In his rest life, he won't stop fighting

489
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,560
until dissenters become silent

490
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,360
and the dogs stop barking.

491
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,560
Mr. Cai

492
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,320
It seems that this old Mr. Lin

493
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
is an opponent worthy of our admiration.

494
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,120
Mr. Cai

495
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:05,920
Cai

496
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,200
Shenshu

497
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,560
Mr. Cai

498
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
Shenshu, what's wrong with your body?

499
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,000
Slight ailment

500
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,840
Mr. Cai, I wrote a letter.

501
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,280
I wanted to give it to you.

502
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,760
Everyone is here today.

503
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,360
I'll read it to everyone.

504
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,800
good

505
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,960
To the chief-editor of "Gong Yan Bao" :

506
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
I've read your articles published on 18th about

507
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,000
the change of ideological trend in Beijing academic circles.

508
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,000
It's inconsistent with the facts.

509
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
Although I was a teacher in Peking University,

510
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
I don't socalize with others

511
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,280
because I am ill for years.

512
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,480
I have little contact with other teachers in Peking University,

513
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,800
not to mention forming factions with them.

514
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
What's more, National Heritage Monthly

515
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,280
is initiated by liberal arts students

516
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,160
Although it's aimed at preserving the quintessence of Chinese culture,

517
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,400
it's not arguing with

518
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,680
New Tide

519
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,080
or other magazines.

520
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,240
I'd appreciate it if you can correct the fasle information.

521
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,400
Yours Liu Shipei.

522
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,920
Mr Cai, I have one more thing to declare.

523
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,960
Go ahead.

524
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,520
If Chen Zhongfu insists on his way,

525
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,920
I will fight him to the end.

526
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
Brother Shengshu, I believe that with brother Zhongfu's character

527
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,800
he will fight with you to the end.

528
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,440
See you later.

529
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,360
All right, all right, we've said what we have to say.

530
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,160
I'm thinking.

531
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,720
About the mole Zhang Fengzai

532
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
should we take measures to punish him?

533
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Mr. Cai

534
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
Towards people like Zhang Fengzai

535
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,560
Peking University will never tolerate them.

536
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,520
Please, please

537
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,880
I'm honored to have Councillor Zhang's coming here late at night

538
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,080
Please sit down, please sit down.

539
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,200
Please, please

540
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,320
Please sit down, please sit down.

541
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I have good tea for you.

542
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,240
No, no, no, no thanks.

543
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,160
No, no, please sit down.

544
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,040
Brother Jing Tan

545
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm sorry for the visit in midnight.

546
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,560
This is my nephew Zhang Fengzai.

547
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
I have something to report to you.

548
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,960
Nice to meet you, uncle Wu.

549
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,480
Sit.

550
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
I've long heard about your great name

551
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,400
I heard that my good nephew was slandered by some people.

552
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,160
and was forced to leave Peking University.

553
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,440
There are many people who believe and support you.

554
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,520
Actually, that's not true, Uncle Wu.

555
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
I was expelled

556
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,840
my  nephew

557
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,160
Gold shines everywhere.

558
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,280
The official announcement of the peace conference has arrived.

559
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
Let me read it to you.

560
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,280
Chinese delegation

561
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,280
Two proposals made by your delegation

562
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
which requsts abolishing the treaty

563
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
signed by the Chinese and Japanese governments

564
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,240
on May 25th, 1915

565
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,360
(Huan Wen posts and

566
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
Hope condition post)

567
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
are not within the authority of the Peace Conference.

568
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
At best, the summit will recognize

569
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,560
The importance of these two proposals

570
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,720
But it can't be settled in peace meeting.

571
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,200
We request the administration department of the Federation of Nations

572
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,640
pay attention to China's position

573
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,040
when it exercises its authority.

574
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,480
So both proposals were rejected.

575
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600
Then we ...

576
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
What are we still doing here?

577
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,960
Ciemenceau also said

578
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,000
Japan representative Mu Ye asked

579
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,240
at the meeting of ten people this morning.

580
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,560
Japan should fully accept

581
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,640
Germany's leased land in Shandong

582
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
And he hoped the conference would support Japan's position.

583
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,480
About proposal for Japan

584
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
Mr Williams, consultant of American delegation, suggested

585
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,880
The Chinese representative should be invited

586
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,200
to attend the debate meeting at three o'clock this afternoon.

587
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,520
and state China's position.

588
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,040
Stand a chance.

589
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,800
So this American

590
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,880
is kind of reliable.

591
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
The Secretary-General of CPC has sent the Chinese delegation

592
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
an official invitation to the meeting.

593
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,600
Two people can attend the meeting.

594
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
Only one of them has the right to speak.

595
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,680
What the government requested

596
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,520
Minister Gu and I attend the meeting.

597
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,840
Minister Gu spoke.

598
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,800
I agree

599
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
Do you have any comments?

600
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,520
Then please, you two.

601
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,960
Since everyone is okay with it

602
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,320
Then we two will do it.

603
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,800
In 1919

604
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,760
The victorious country held a peace conference in Paris.

605
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,560
On this peace meeting controlled by

606
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,560
Britain, France, America and Italy

607
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,200
The world order had been redefined.

608
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,440
The rights and interests of Jiaozhou Bay, Shandong Province, China

609
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,160
obtained by Germany before WW I

610
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
became the focus of disputes between China and Japan.

611
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,960
The Japanese delegation proposed

612
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Japan should inherit German rights and interests.

613
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,200
Chinese representative Gu Weijun argued strongly on just grounds

614
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,120
and refuted Japan's demands one by one.

615
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,320
He pointed out

616
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,720
No matter from the history of Shandong

617
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,160
Geographical and cultural aspects

618
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,400
or the victorious position China have

619
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,320
towards Germany,

620
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,000
Jiaozhou leased land

621
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
Jiaozhou railway

622
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,800
and all other rights

623
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,800
should be returned to China directly.

624
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,080
But pro-Japanese fraction such as Cao Rulin in Beiyang government

625
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,680
in Beiyang government

626
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,040
said the move was purely unauthorized Unde that pressure of Japan

627
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,840
unde that pressure of Japan.

628
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,920
Gu Weijun's speech

629
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Caused great dissatisfaction in Japanese government.

630
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,840
It ordered Xiao Xiji, Minister in China.

631
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,280
Then I ordered the Minister in China, Xiao Xun Xi Ji.

632
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
Put pressure on Beiyang government

633
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,160
chairman of the committee

634
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,480
great-uncle

635
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
I really have one thing

636
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,520
that I don't know what to do with it.

637
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,360
So I come to ask for advice.

638
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480
I know that Japanese minister Xiaofan has come here.

639
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,320
You're scared.

640
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,400
What did Xiaofan say?

641
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,600
Xiaofan said

642
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,920
Gu Weijun is going to announce the secret agreement between China and Japan

643
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,000
on French press conference

644
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,680
He was ordered

645
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,240
to ask the Chinese government to call the delegation.

646
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,760
and ask them speak and act cautioiusly.

647
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,880
They were really dissitified

648
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
by the performance of the Chinese delegation in Paris.

649
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,280
Make a solemn protest

650
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,400
And threatened to publish

651
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,680
the China-Japan Agreement on Shandong Issue

652
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,120
signed by Zhang Zongxiang on 1918.

653
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,160
In fact, this matter is easy to solve.

654
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,760
Some people in the government are afraid of Japan

655
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,680
Chinese people are not afraid of Japan.

656
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,280
Sell newspapers

657
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,480
Japan's Minister Xiaofan

658
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:26,880

659
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,600
Put pressure on Chen Lu

660
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,240
Put pressure on Chen Lu

661
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,000

lettered to the Chinese delegation of Paris Peace Conference

663
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,120
They ask the Chinese representative to resist the pressure.

664
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,320
and never betray our country.

665
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,840
Sell newspapers sell newspapers.

666
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
Japanese minister Xiaofan

667
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:41,920

668
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,800

I will read

673
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,760
the ppen letter to the Chinese delegation of Paris Peace Conference

674
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,040
written by all students in Peking University.

675
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,320
Delegates

676
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,760
All the students in Peking University in recent days

677
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,120
heard your brilliant debate at the peace conference.

678
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,000
to ask for our rights and interests in Shandong.

679
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,520
We are deeply excited

680
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,880
Your performance

681
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,560
is an example for young Chinese students.

682
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,600
Recently, there was a Japanese minister

683
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,240
breaking into our Ministry of Foreign Affairs  to scare us.

684
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,320
We hope that

685
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,120
all delegates will bear the pressure

686
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,560
and never allow Japan to occupy Shandong.

687
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,960
Shandong and Qingdao issue

688
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,640
concerns the survival of our country.

689
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,240
Strive for sovereignty.

All students in Peking University are supporting you.

692
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,400
classmates

693
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,320
In order to pay close attention to

694
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,000
the development of the Paris Peace Conference

695
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,840
in order to better organize everyone

696
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,560
and mke everyone know the truth of the situation timely

697
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,480
At this gathering, we've voted

698
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
more than ten student union officers

699
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,800
so as to unite with universities in Beijing.

700
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,240
to take concerted actions.

701
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,280
Welcome

702
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,200
Today, we are elected as representatives

703
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,600
We are both excited and scared.

704
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
We feel the great responsibility on our shoulders

705
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,600
But please believe us.

706
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,640
We will fight with all our strength to fulfill our mission.

707
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,360
pledge to resist Japan and defend Shandong

708
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Next, let's invite Mr. Li Dazhao to speak.

709
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,240
classmates

710
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,200
The peace conference in Paris

711
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,520
is an international conference

712
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,040
that China attended as a victorious country.

713
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
So since it's an international conference

714
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,520
Countries safeguard their national interests at the meeting.

715
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,680
Put forward one's correct opinion.

716
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,160
It is the important principle that independent countries should have.

717
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,480
There is no reason for other country to interfere.

718
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
But just because

719
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
Our Gu Weijun Gu envoy.

720
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
Represents all of us Chinese.

721
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Appeal at the Paris Peace Conference

722
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,920
To recover our rights and interests in Shandong.

723
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,880
The Japanese actually asked to replace him.

724
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Boys and girls, you say

725
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,800
can our 400 million Chinese compatriots

726
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,880
agree with this?

727
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
cannot

728
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,240
At this conference advocating world fairness

729
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,280
We have put forward the correct proposition of our country.

730
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,000
The Japanese rushed into our Foreign Ministry.

731
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,480
to threaten us

732
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:58,720
to knuckle under to them

733
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:58,960
My students, you say

734
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,120
you say can our 400 million Chinese compatriots

735
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,280
be intimidated by them?

736
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,600
No

737
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,760
Japan claims to have a million troops.

738
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,280
that are ready to fight

739
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,040
to intimidate us into

740
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
giving up the rights and interests of Shandong.

741
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,360
classmates

742
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,680
You say, can we give in because of it.

743
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,480
Are you afraid of it?

744
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
No, no, no

745
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,640
This Wang Daxie sends three telegrams a day.

746
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,320
asking me toget back to Paris.

747
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
What's going on here?

748
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,400
What's the matter

749
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,920
Chief Lu there nothing big happened

750
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
But there are important things you need to decide.

751
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,920
Request to abolish May 25th, 1915

752
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,560
A treaty signed by the Chinese and Japanese governments

753
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
that is the Huan Wen posts

754
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,520
Hope condition post is rejected.

755
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,280
Do you want to send it again after being rejected?

756
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,160
There is no agreement.

757
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,280
I can't coordinate, so I have to ask you to come out.

758
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,840
I read the post on Shandong issue.

759
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,120
In my opinion, posts about Shandong

760
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
and secret agreements on the Shandong issue signed by China and Japan

761
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,280
Let's put it on hold.

762
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,440
Don't send it to the peace conference for the time being.

763
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,400
It is advisable to wait until the Japanese side agrees to deliver it.

764
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,080
Minister Hu really is

765
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,920
Frightened by the Japanese minister.

766
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,680
I'm also thinking of the country.

767
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,760
If the Japanese do appeal to arms

768
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,080
Then the situation will be difficult to clean up.

769
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
Besides, the government is still hesitating.

770
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,920
Let's take a long-term view.

771
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,800
A telegram has just arrived.

772
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,240
I wonder if you have seen it.

773
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
Since the intimidation of Japanese minister Xiaofan

774
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
 was published in the newspaper,

775
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
The jade people are in high spirits.

776
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,400
They send telegrams to the delegation.

777
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,880
I have received dozens of letters in the past few days.

778
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,360
All the articles are stressing the importance of recovering Shandong with sincere words.

779
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,440
We are asked to resist the pressure.

780
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,240
This is the telegram just received

781
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,000
from students in Peking University.

782
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,320
They request us to refuse 

783
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,400
Japan's demand for occupying Shandong

784
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,080
Even young students know

785
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
Shandong and Qingdao issue

786
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,080
concerns the survival of our country.

787
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,360
Why did Minister Hu hesitate?

788
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,960
My heart for my country is bright.

789
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,360
Don't you all understand?

790
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720
Ok, Xin Wu, Shao chuan

791
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,440
Everybody, listen to me.

792
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,080
We can never flatter the Japanese with the Shandong issue.

793
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,560
Now the participating countries

794
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,720
have expressed sympathy for us.

795
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
If we can't insist at this time

796
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,320
and compromise halfway,

797
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,040
China will lose its international reputation, 

798
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,400
even if someone else is willing to help us.

799
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,200
What will we have then

800
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,120
to ask for help from other countries?

801
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,680
Comparing the two possible aftermaths

802
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,360
my opinion is

803
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,120
send the post again.

804
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,800
OK

805
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,800
I

806
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,840
I'm going to ask Wilson for help.

807
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,800
After Xiaoyou Jitong scared the Beiyang government

808
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,040
After Mi Xiaofan 

809
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,520
scared the Beiyang government

810
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,200
the Japanese delegation once again proposed at the peace conference

811
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,480
that Germany's rights and interests in Shandong, China

812
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,240
should be handed over to Japan.

813
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,200
While in order to limit Japan's

814
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
expansion momentum in East Asia

815
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,560
Wilson, at the beginning of the peace conference

816
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,880
rejected Japan's request.

817
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,920
Mohism is a mainstream in Pre-Qin Dynasty

818
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,560
together with Confucianism.

819
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Mohism takes universal love as its core.

820
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
takes thrift and virtue as the fulcrum

821
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,840
It has ten propositions. Let's have a look.

822
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,160
Love and not attack

823
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,320
Emphasize on people's ability instead of status

824
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,040
Respect the  heaven.

825
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,920
and the ghost.

826
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,240
Refuse extravagance and don't accept fate

827
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,400
Thrift in daily life and burial

828
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,440
Universal love is the core of Mohism

829
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,960
The so-called universal love

830
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,360
contains the meaning of equality and philanthropism.

831
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,920
Mohism asked the monarch and his subjects, father and his sons

832
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,040
and brothers

833
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,080
should be friendly to each other on the basis of equality.

834
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
They should love others as love themselves.

835
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,000
And in its doctrine, in society

836
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,200
if the strong bully the weak, the rich insult the poor 

837
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,120
dignitaries despise the poor

838
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,600
is because people don't love each other.

839
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,320
Sir, I don't understand one thing.

840
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,040
Oriental people(Japanese) and westerners are forcibly occupying our Shandong province,

841
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,800
This is a typical behavior of the strong bullying the weak

842
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,800
Is this also because that people don't love each other 

843
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
as Sir mentioned above?

844
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,800
my students

845
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,760
Guo Xingang

846
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,440
raised a question in class today.

847
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,720
This is a good thing.

848
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,000
This proves that Guo Xingang has started to think.

849
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,760
But Guo

850
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,920
 your question is beside the point.

851
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,600
Today we are talking about ancient Chinese philosophy.

852
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,520
It's an academic issue.

853
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,840
What you said just now is a political issue.
