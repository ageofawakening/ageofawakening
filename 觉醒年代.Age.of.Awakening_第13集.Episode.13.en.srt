00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:03,998
[Episode Thirteen]

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,520
Greetings, sir.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,640
[Gu Hongming, styled Tangsheng, Peking University Professor]
 Some rare guests!

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,320
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Peking University Professor]
 Professor Hu,

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,280
Are you here to learn English from me?

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,400
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]
 Or?

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,360
Professor Gu, I'm here to seek you as a master.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,800
How interesting!

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,040
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]
 You speak in the vernacular,

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
yet come here to learn English poems.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,720
It doesn't make any sense.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
Sir, I'm sincerely here to learn from you.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,800
In that case, have you brought any presents to your master-to-be?

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,280
Presents,

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,040
didn't you bring them?

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,120
Shouchang, have you brought any 

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,440
presents to our master-to-be?

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,160
I thought it's you who came to be apprenticed.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,440
Right, didn't you bring the presents?

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,320
Right?

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,120
It's him seeking to be apprenticed.

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,880
Professor Gu, I'll treat you with a meal.

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,880
I, Gu Hongming, have dined with the emperor before,

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,040
I also have eaten next to coolies.

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,360
But with snobs who forget their origins and toady to foreign powers, 

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,720
never ever!

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,000
Not even once!

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
Mr. Tangsheng, I apologize about the confusion.

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,720
We're here by order of Mr. Cai

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
and we're sending this invitation on behalf of Peking University. 

32
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,960
By order of Mr. Cai?

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,680
Exactly.

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
Then I must honor this invitation.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,480
I must.

36
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,240
But I also have one condition.

37
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,200
Please let us know.

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,760
I will pick the restaurant and order drinks and dishes.

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,360
And my two servants will also be there to wait on me.

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,000
Would you concur with this condition?

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
We concur, absolutely!

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
It's all up to you to decide.

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,040
Well then, I'll ask my servants to make arrangement.

44
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
You can wait for further notice.

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,760
Alright.

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Sir, please excuse us then.

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,560
Thank you, sir.

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Thank you.

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Please come in side.

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,040
Had our guests arrived?

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,680
Yes, they have.

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,240
How many of them?

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
Oh, my goodness, today our Donxing Inn 

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,760
has an eye-opener!

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
This Master Gu you invited 

56
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
has a huge display.

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
He has two servants waiting on him.

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,760
They are all wearing queues. How dazzling!

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,080
Brother Zhongfu,

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
I feel uncertain now --

61
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,880
What if we didn't bring enough money?

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Our guest is probably going to be as extravagant as possible.

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,400
Not necessarily.

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,240
The reason why he's so affected is  

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,240
because he didn't want to be slighted.

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,440
He simply lacks confidence.

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
Why don't you turn off the lights in daytime? Such a waste of wax

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Professor Gu, wishing you good health. (In Qing Dynasty style)

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
We apologize for keeping you wait.

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,640
We're all colleagues from Peking University.

71
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,280
Based on seniority, I'm taking my seat at the head of the table.

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
Dean Chen should take the second seat after that,

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,520
followed by Director Li.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
According to the etiquette of Qing Empire, 

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
Dr. Hu wouldn't even be eligible for seats at the table.

76
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,480
But today,

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,880
since you were sent here by Chancellor Cai,

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,520
please take the end seat.

79
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,040
Thank you for offering us the seats.

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,480
Thank you, Professor Gu, for offering us the seats.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,840
Okay, let's sit down.

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,960
Waiter,

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
you may now bring the warm dishes.

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,080
Coming soon!

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,640
Boundless universe, bright sun and moon.

86
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,840
There are only two decent men in China at the moment.

87
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,480
One is Mr. Cai Yuanpei.

88
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
The other is me, Gu Hongming.

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
For after Mr. Cai was selected to be a member of Imperial Academy,

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,760
he refused to become an official, but rather joined the revolution.

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,840
He's still part the revolution even till now.

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,360
As for me, after I followed Master Zhang Zhidong (one of the four most famous officials of the late Qing dynasty, known for advocating controlled reform and modernization of Chinese troops)

93
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
I served the Qing Court, 

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
and I have remained a Royalist till today.

95
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,960
For a Royalist such as myself,

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
I only follow orders of two people.

97
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
One is the Emperor himself,

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
the other is Mr. Cai Yuanpei.

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,560
Mr. Cai is my chancellor.

100
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
He invited me to this meal today, so I was obliged to come.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Therefore, this first cup

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,240
is to Chancellor Cai.

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
We can get started.

104
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,360
Please.

105
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
In terms of gourmet food,

106
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,400
the top restaurants in Beijing are the "Eight Inns".

107
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,080
Among the "Eight Inns",

108
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
Dongxing Inn takes the first place.

109
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,120
Of course.

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,840
The dishes they prepare here belong to the Jiaodong Cuisine of Shandong Province.

111
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,320
You'll be able to have their signature dishes in a bit.

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Braised Sliced Chicken with Egg and Milk

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
Stewed Cuttlefish Roe

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
Braised Sea Cucumber with Scallion

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
Stir-fried Chicken with Soybean Sauce

116
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,560
Deep-fried Chicken Gizzards, and etc.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Dr. Hu, this is your first time here, right?

118
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
Do the dishes sound intriguing to you?

119
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,760
This meal with Professor Gu is

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,280
really eye-opening to me.

121
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,840
Professor Gu,

122
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,440
may I propose a toast to you?

123
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,120
Hang on a minute,

124
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
I thought you are here to seek me as your master.

125
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
I have to quiz you first. 

126
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
Please ask away, sir.

127
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,680
Last year when Zhang Xun was having his birthday,

128
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,200
I sent him a couplet.

129
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,520
The first line was "Lotus wilts and the rain-holding top gone"

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,720
The second line reads "Chrysanthemum withers but the frost-resistant stem remains"

131
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,640
What are these two lines referring to?

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,320
In the line "Chrysanthemum withers but the frost-resistant stem remains"

133
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,600
the "frost-resistant stem" naturally refers to 

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,480
the queue you and Zhang Xun both keeps.

135
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,160
The "rain-holding top" Professor Gu just mentioned 

136
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
is of course...

137
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,200
what is it?

138
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
I actually have no idea, Professor Gu.

139
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Director Li,

140
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,600
you're the director of Peking University Library.

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,360
You should know what it is.

142
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
Professor Gu, I have little talent,

143
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
but if I'm not mistaken,

144
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,560
this "rain-holding top" should be

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,320
the hat worn by Qing Officials.

146
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,760
Smart! You're deserving the title of library director.

147
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,120
Dr. Hu, now you're learning, right?

148
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,160
Thank you for your teaching.

149
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm talentless, I'll drink this as a punishment.

150
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,280
Dean Chen has always been articulate person with eloquent speech,

151
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,520
how come you're so quiet today?

152
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,520
Professor Gu,

153
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,800
upon hearing Professor Gu's informed opinion,

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
which enlightens the benighted and rouses the ignorant,

155
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,240
I all of a sudden

156
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,840
feels... slightly nervous

157
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,160
and didn't know what to contribute to the conversation.

158
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,960
I'm just afraid...

159
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,800
Dean Chen is the standard-bearer of New Culture,

160
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
while I'm the clear stream among the Royalists.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
We're vehicles on two parallel tracks,

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
and will never have any intersections.

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,960
But Dean Chen is paying respect to worthy and virtuous men today

164
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,400
through this 

165
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
sumptuous banquet. 

166
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
You must have some favor to ask me.

167
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Now that we've had three rounds of wine,

168
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
please just tell me what it is, Dean Chen.

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, I'll drink up this to show my respect to you first.

170
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,280
Professor Gu,

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,840
I assume you've already heard of

172
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,240
the dismissal of Cartwright from our university.

173
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,520
Of course, I have.

174
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,160
If it was not for Mr Cai's mercy,

175
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,280
you probably would have

176
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
categorized me with people like Cartwright.

177
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,720
Professor Gu's matter has reached forgone conclusion. 

178
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,240
But the discharge of Cartwright 

179
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
had become a thorny pending case nowadays.

180
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,520
Cartwright instigated the British Prime Minister, 

181
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,520
the British Embassy and various of other power 

182
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
to pressure Peking University into their terms.

183
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,120
They are pressing false charges against us, including breach of contract

184
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
and discrimination against foreigners.

185
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,760
They are demanding apologies, financial compensation and resumption of posts.

186
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,320
They will be satisfied with nothing but Mr Cai's destruction.

187
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,520
This is outrageous!

188
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,880
This Cartwright,

189
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
how dare he coerce our Mr. Cai!

190
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,000
I, Gu Hongming, will fight him to death!

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,280
After a lot of twists and turns, 

192
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Beiyang Government finally agreed that 

193
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,160
Peking University can form a professor delegation 

194
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,720
to formally negotiate with the British Embassy 

195
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
regarding the discharge of Cartwright.

196
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
Mr. Cai pointed out,

197
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
how can we go to court with the British

198
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
without Gu Tangsheng, the Britain Expert?

199
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,440
Indeed.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
This why today the three of us

201
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,680
entrusted by Mr. Cai and on behalf of Peking University 

202
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,600
to invite you to take up this important duty.

203
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,040
We sincerely hope Professor Gu would condescend to 

204
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,960
join our professor delegation 

205
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
and fight it out with the Brits!

206
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,640
No one knows me better than Mr. Cai!

207
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,120
You don't have to do it yourself, I'll help.

208
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,240
I'll help, don't worry.

209
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,640
Sorry, sorry.

210
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
I was just... Alright.

211
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,280
Thank you, thank you!

212
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
Great, Dean Chen,

213
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
Director Li,

214
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Dr. Hu,

215
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,320
for this professor delegation, I'm in!

216
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,400
Let's all drink a toast for this!

217
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,440
Wonderful!

218
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,080
I, old Gu,

219
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,000
went to Britain at the age of ten.

220
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,040
I studied in Europe at fourteen. 

221
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm very familiar with the mindset of westerners (British people)

222
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
as well as their dispositions and manners.

223
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,720
We can tell.

224
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
Let me give you a few pointers:

225
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,360
First, 

226
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,440
aloof and cunning.

227
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,080
They're scared of taking responsibilities, 

228
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
they shirk as much as they can.

229
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,920
Right on point!

230
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,040
Second,

231
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,640
hypocritical and vain.

232
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
On the one hand, they're greedy for profits,

233
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
on the other hand, they often feel ashamed to ask bluntly. 

234
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,120
Exactly!

235
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,040
They care only for the show.

236
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,960
Third,

237
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,280
exclusiveness,

238
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes!

239
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
unsociable, arrogant, stubborn and inarticulate,

240
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:35,920
unsociable, arrogant, stubborn and inarticulate,

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,720
unsociable, arrogant, stubborn and inarticulate,

242
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,600
Indeed!

243
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,160
difficult towards foreigners. 

244
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,800
Typically island country mindset.

245
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,360
You're right!

246
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,040
Forth,

247
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,120
Conservativeness

248
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,960
Yes!

249
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,800
(Translating "conservativeness" into Chinese)

250
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120
Extremely reluctant to accept new things.

251
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,520
I'll handle this case successfully.

252
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,720
As soon as I show up,

253
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,960
they will be intimidated.

254
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,440
As soon as I speak,

255
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
they will flee pell-mell.

256
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,480
Awesome!

257
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,280
Professor Gu,

258
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,120
Mr. Cai also asked me to tell me that

259
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,800
the chief negotiator of our delegation is

260
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,480
Hu Shi.

261
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
The others are supposed to support his work. 

262
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,880
So this is

263
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
Mr. Cai's arrangement?

264
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,000
Indeed.

265
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160
“Within plane tree blossoms lining the roads on Mount Danshan,”

266
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,440
“Sweeter is the singing of young phoenixes than that of seniors.”

267
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
Alright, then, I, Gu Hongming, will submit myself to the service of 

268
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
this vernacular kid, as his military advisor.

269
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Great! 

270
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,200
Professor Gu,

271
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,200
The three of us will propose a toast to you together.

272
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
Thank you, Sir.

273
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,160
Thank you, Sir.

274
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,160
Good!

275
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,320
For Peking University,

276
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,280
and for Mr. Cai, cheers!

277
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920
Cheers!
