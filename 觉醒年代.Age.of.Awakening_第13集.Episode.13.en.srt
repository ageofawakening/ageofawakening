00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,520
Greetings, sir.

00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:08,811
[Gu Hongming, born Tangsheng, Peking University Professor]

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,640
Some rare guests!

[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Peking University Professor]

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,320
Professor Hu.

8
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,280
Are you here to learn English from me?

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,400
Or?

10
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:15,679
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Peking University Dean of Liberal Arts]

11
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,360
Professor Gu, I'm here to seek you as a master.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,800
How interesting!

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,040
You speak in the vernacular,

14
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:21,317
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Peking University Library Director]

15
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
yet come here to learn English poems.

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,720
It doesn't make any sense.

17
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
Sir, I'm sincerely here to learn from you.

18
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,800
In that case, have you brought any presents to your master-to-be?

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,280
Presents,

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,040
didn't you bring them?

21
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,120
Shouchang, have you brought any 

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,440
presents to our master-to-be?

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,160
I thought it's you who came to be apprenticed.

24
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,440
Right, didn't you bring the presents?

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,320
Right?

26
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,120
It's him seeking to be apprenticed.

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,880
Professor Gu, I'll treat you with a meal.

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,880
I, Gu Hongming, have dined with the emperor before,

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,040
I also have eaten next to coolies.

30
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,360
But with snobs who forget their origins and toady to foreign powers, 

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,720
never ever!

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,000
Not even once!

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
Mr. Tangsheng, I apologize about the confusion.

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,720
We're here by order of Mr. Cai

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
and we're sending this invitation on behalf of Peking University. 

36
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,960
By order of Mr. Cai?

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,680
Exactly.

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
Then I must honor this invitation.

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,480
I must.

40
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,240
But I also have one condition.

41
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,200
Please let us know.

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,760
I will pick the restaurant and order drinks and dishes.

43
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,360
And my two servants will also be there to wait on me.

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,000
Would you concur with this condition?

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
We concur, absolutely!

46
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
It's all up to you to decide.

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,040
Well then, I'll ask my servants to make arrangement.

48
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
You can wait for further notice.

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,760
Alright.

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Sir, please excuse us then.

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,560
Thank you, sir.

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Thank you.

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Please come in side.

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,040
Had our guests arrived?

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,680
Yes, they have.

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,240
How many of them?

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
Oh, my goodness, today our Donxing Inn 

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,760
has an eye-opener!

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
This Master Gu you invited 

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
has a huge display.

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
He has two servants waiting on him.

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,760
They are all wearing queues. How dazzling!

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,080
Brother Zhongfu,

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
I feel uncertain now --

65
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,880
What if we didn't bring enough money?

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Our guest is probably going to be as extravagant as possible.

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,400
Not necessarily.

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,240
The reason why he's so affected is  

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,240
because he didn't want to be slighted.

70
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,440
He simply lacks confidence.

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
Why don't you turn off the lights in daytime? Such a waste of wax

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Professor Gu, wishing you good health. (In Qing Dynasty style)

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
We apologize for keeping you wait.

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,640
We're all colleagues from Peking University.

75
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,280
Based on seniority, I'm taking my seat at the head of the table.

76
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
Dean Chen should take the second seat after that,

77
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,520
followed by Director Li.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
According to the etiquette of Qing Empire, 

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
Dr. Hu wouldn't even be eligible for seats at the table.

80
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,480
But today,

81
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,880
since you were sent here by Chancellor Cai,

82
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,520
please take the end seat.

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,040
Thank you for offering us the seats.

84
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,480
Thank you, Professor Gu, for offering us the seats.

85
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,840
Okay, let's sit down.

86
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,960
Waiter,

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
you may now bring the warm dishes.

88
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,080
Coming soon!

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,640
Boundless universe, bright sun and moon.

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,840
There are only two decent men in China at the moment.

91
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,480
One is Mr. Cai Yuanpei.

92
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
The other is me, Gu Hongming.

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
For after Mr. Cai was selected to be a member of Imperial Academy,

94
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,760
he refused to become an official, but rather joined the revolution.

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,840
He's still part the revolution even till now.

96
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,360
As for me, after I followed Master Zhang Zhidong (one of the four most famous officials of the late Qing dynasty, known for advocating controlled reform and modernization of Chinese troops)

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
I served the Qing Court, 

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
and I have remained a Royalist till today.

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,960
For a Royalist such as myself,

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
I only follow orders of two people.

101
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
One is the Emperor himself,

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
the other is Mr. Cai Yuanpei.

103
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,560
Mr. Cai is my chancellor.

104
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
He invited me to this meal today, so I was obliged to come.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Therefore, this first cup

106
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,240
is to Chancellor Cai.

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
We can get started.

108
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,360
Please.

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
In terms of gourmet food,

110
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,400
the top restaurants in Beijing are the "Eight Inns".

111
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,080
Among the "Eight Inns",

112
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
Dongxing Inn takes the first place.

113
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,120
Of course.

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,840
The dishes they prepare here belong to the Jiaodong Cuisine of Shandong Province.

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,320
You'll be able to have their signature dishes in a bit.

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Braised Sliced Chicken with Egg and Milk

117
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
Stewed Cuttlefish Roe

118
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
Braised Sea Cucumber with Scallion

119
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
Stir-fried Chicken with Soybean Sauce

120
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,560
Deep-fried Chicken Gizzards, and etc.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Dr. Hu, this is your first time here, right?

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
Do the dishes sound intriguing to you?

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,760
This meal with Professor Gu is

124
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,280
really eye-opening to me.

125
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,840
Professor Gu,

126
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,440
may I propose a toast to you?

127
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,120
Hang on a minute,

128
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
I thought you are here to seek me as your master.

129
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
I have to quiz you first. 

130
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
Please ask away, sir.

131
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,680
Last year when Zhang Xun was having his birthday,

132
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,200
I sent him a couplet.

133
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,520
The first line was "Lotus wilts and the rain-holding top gone"

134
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,720
The second line reads "Chrysanthemum withers but the frost-resistant stem remains"

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,640
What are these two lines referring to?

136
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,320
In the line "Chrysanthemum withers but the frost-resistant stem remains"

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,600
the "frost-resistant stem" naturally refers to 

138
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,480
the queue you and Zhang Xun both keeps.

139
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,160
The "rain-holding top" Professor Gu just mentioned 

140
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
is of course...

141
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,200
what is it?

142
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
I actually have no idea, Professor Gu.

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Director Li,

144
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,600
you're the director of Peking University Library.

145
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,360
You should know what it is.

146
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
Professor Gu, I have little talent,

147
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
but if I'm not mistaken,

148
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,560
this "rain-holding top" should be

149
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,320
the hat worn by Qing Officials.

150
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,760
Smart! You're deserving the title of library director.

151
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,120
Dr. Hu, now you're learning, right?

152
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,160
Thank you for your teaching.

153
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm talentless, I'll drink this as a punishment.

154
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,280
Dean Chen has always been articulate person with eloquent speech,

155
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,520
how come you're so quiet today?

156
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,520
Professor Gu,

157
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,800
upon hearing Professor Gu's informed opinion,

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
which enlightens the benighted and rouses the ignorant,

159
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,240
I all of a sudden

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,840
feels... slightly nervous

161
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,160
and didn't know what to contribute to the conversation.

162
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,960
I'm just afraid...

163
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,800
Dean Chen is the standard-bearer of New Culture,

164
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
while I'm the clear stream among the Royalists.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
We're vehicles on two parallel tracks,

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
and will never have any intersections.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,960
But Dean Chen is paying respect to worthy and virtuous men today

168
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,400
through this 

169
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
sumptuous banquet. 

170
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
You must have some favor to ask me.

171
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Now that we've had three rounds of wine,

172
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
please just tell me what it is, Dean Chen.

173
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, I'll drink up this to show my respect to you first.

174
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,280
Professor Gu,

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,840
I assume you've already heard of

176
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,240
the dismissal of Cartwright from our university.

177
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,520
Of course, I have.

178
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,160
If it was not for Mr Cai's mercy,

179
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,280
you probably would have

180
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
categorized me with people like Cartwright.

181
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,720
Professor Gu's matter has reached forgone conclusion. 

182
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,240
But the discharge of Cartwright 

183
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
had become a thorny pending case nowadays.

184
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,520
Cartwright instigated the British Prime Minister, 

185
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,520
the British Embassy and various of other power 

186
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
to pressure Peking University into their terms.

187
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,120
They are pressing false charges against us, including breach of contract

188
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
and discrimination against foreigners.

189
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,760
They are demanding apologies, financial compensation and resumption of posts.

190
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,320
They will be satisfied with nothing but Mr Cai's destruction.

191
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,520
This is outrageous!

192
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,880
This Cartwright,

193
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
how dare he coerce our Mr. Cai!

194
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,000
I, Gu Hongming, will fight him to death!

195
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,280
After a lot of twists and turns, 

196
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Beiyang Government finally agreed that 

197
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,160
Peking University can form a professor delegation 

198
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,720
to formally negotiate with the British Embassy 

199
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
regarding the discharge of Cartwright.

200
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
Mr. Cai pointed out,

201
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
how can we go to court with the British

202
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
without Gu Tangsheng, the Britain Expert?

203
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,440
Indeed.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
This why today the three of us

205
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,680
entrusted by Mr. Cai and on behalf of Peking University 

206
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,600
to invite you to take up this important duty.

207
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,040
We sincerely hope Professor Gu would condescend to 

208
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,960
join our professor delegation 

209
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
and fight it out with the Brits!

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,640
No one knows me better than Mr. Cai!

211
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,120
You don't have to do it yourself, I'll help.

212
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,240
I'll help, don't worry.

213
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,640
Sorry, sorry.

214
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
I was just... Alright.

215
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,280
Thank you, thank you!

216
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
Great, Dean Chen,

217
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
Director Li,

218
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Dr. Hu,

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,320
for this professor delegation, I'm in!

220
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,400
Let's all drink a toast for this!

221
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,440
Wonderful!

222
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,080
I, old Gu,

223
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,000
went to Britain at the age of ten.

224
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,040
I studied in Europe at fourteen. 

225
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm very familiar with the mindset of westerners (British people)

226
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
as well as their dispositions and manners.

227
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,720
We can tell.

228
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
Let me give you a few pointers:

229
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,360
First, 

230
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,440
aloof and cunning.

231
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,080
They're scared of taking responsibilities, 

232
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
they shirk as much as they can.

233
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,920
Right on point!

234
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,040
Second,

235
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,640
hypocritical and vain.

236
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
On the one hand, they're greedy for profits,

237
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
on the other hand, they often feel ashamed to ask bluntly. 

238
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,120
Exactly!

239
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,040
They care only for the show.

240
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,960
Third,

241
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,280
exclusiveness,

242
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes!

243
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
unsociable, arrogant, stubborn and inarticulate,

244
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,600
Indeed!

245
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,160
difficult towards foreigners. 

246
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,800
Typically island country mindset.

247
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,360
You're right!

248
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,040
Forth,

249
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,120
Conservativeness

250
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,960
Yes!

251
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,800
(Translating "conservativeness" into Chinese)

252
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120
Extremely reluctant to accept new things.

253
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,520
I'll handle this case successfully.

254
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,720
As soon as I show up,

255
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,960
they will be intimidated.

256
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,440
As soon as I speak,

257
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
they will flee pell-mell.

258
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,480
Awesome!

259
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,280
Professor Gu,

260
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,120
Mr. Cai also asked me to tell me that

261
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,800
the chief negotiator of our delegation is

262
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,480
Hu Shi.

263
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
The others are supposed to support his work. 

264
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,880
So this is

265
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
Mr. Cai's arrangement?

266
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,000
Indeed.

267
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160
“Within plane tree blossoms lining the roads on Mount Danshan,”

268
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,440
“Sweeter is the singing of young phoenixes than that of seniors.”

269
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
Alright, then, I, Gu Hongming, will submit myself to the service of 

270
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
this vernacular kid, as his military advisor.

271
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Great! 

272
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,200
Professor Gu,

273
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,200
The three of us will propose a toast to you together.

274
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
Thank you, Sir.

275
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,160
Thank you, Sir.

276
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,160
Good!

277
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,320
For Peking University,

278
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,280
and for Mr. Cai, cheers!

279
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920
Cheers!

280
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
The Chinese guests will soon arrive.

281
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:41,864
[John Newell Jordan, British envoy to China]
[British Embassy in China]

282
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,760
Is everything ready?

283
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,280
Yes, everything is ready.

284
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,240
Jordan!

285
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,680
The people that are coming today,

286
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,240
are top talents from Peking University.

287
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,880
All of them are good at debate.

288
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,480
So be careful.

289
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,799
[Cartwright, Peking University Foreign Professor]

290
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,640
Don't be fooled by them.

291
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,160
Don't worry, Cartwright.

292
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,600
Peking University has sent

293
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,640
a strange negotiating team today.

294
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,400
The leading figures from the old and the new culture

295
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,960
will be present in the meeting.

296
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,520
This will be our honour.

297
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,960
to give them an opportunity

298
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,640
to hold a cultural debate here.

299
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
Are you referring to Hong Ming?

300
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,840
Exactly.

301
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,280
From what I know,

302
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
Hong Ming is

303
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,120
Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi's sworn enemy.

304
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
So you're saying,

305
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
you will make them quarrel here?

306
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,600
If it happens,

307
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,280
tt would be a good show for us.

308
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:34,800
Indeed.

309
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
Today you are the main speaker.

310
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,280
At the debate later

311
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,320
You will be the first speaker

312
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,440
Don't worry, I know

313
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
Let us prepare first

314
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,360
Gentlemen, please have a seat

315
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Let me introduce you to

316
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,600
This is the diplomat from the British Embassy,

317
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,800
Mr Jordan

318
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
This is the first secretary from the embassy

319
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,800
Mr Charles

320
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
And I am sure you all must know

321
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,040
Mr Cartwright

322
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,560
You should address me as Professor Cartwright

323
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,280
This is the dean of Liberal Arts of Peking University

324
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
Professor Chen Du Xiu

325
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
This is Professor Hu She

326
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,000
This is

327
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,920
Professor Gu

328
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,520
I welcome you here

329
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,800
This is Mr Li Da Zhao

330
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,040
One behalf of the British Embassy

331
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,240
I welcome all Peking University professors

332
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,960
especially Professor Gu Hong Ming

333
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,120
who is highly respected by us westerners

334
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
It is a great honour and pleasure

335
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
To be able to negotiate with Professor Gu personally

336
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,840
Let's get started

337
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,360
Who is going to talk first

338
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
Professor Hu She is Peking University's main speaker

339
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,440
Let Professor Hu She begin

340
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
Good morning, gentlemen

341
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm really astonished by the note of protest

342
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,640
against wrongful and unfair dismissal

343
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,680
of Professor Cartwright from his position

344
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,680
at Peking University

345
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,200
Things like dismissal of the foreign teachers from Peking University

346
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,680
are common situations

347
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,440
in education management

348
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,040
According to students' complaints,

349
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,240
Peking University has carried out a thorough investigation

350
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,600
of Professor Cartwright's teaching level,

351
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
attitudes

352
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
behaviour and other aspects.

353
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,880
The investigation has revealed

354
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,160
As a result, large amount of evidence indicated that

355
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,680
Professor Cartwright

356
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,560
Is not competent at his job at all

357
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,160
Furthermore

358
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
He violated university rules

359
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,680
which brought negative impact

360
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,400
and irretrievable loss

361
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,600
Therefore, based on relevant regulation

362
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,960
and rules made by the government and the university

363
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,960
the review committee decided to discharge Mr Cartwright from his position

364
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
This is our internal affair

365
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
It has nothing to do with

366
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,680
The British Government or the British embassy

367
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,920
Professor Hu

368
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
You sound like you are not here to negotiate

369
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,600
But to denouce us

370
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,240
Professor Cartwright is a British citizen

371
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,880
He was introduced by the British embassy

372
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,960
to the Chinese education ministry

373
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
to teach at Peking University

374
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
Now, his interests in China have been damaged

375
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
Certainly, the British Embassy cannot ignore it

376
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
Moreover,

377
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,680
It is a sacred and undeniable right to protest

378
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,520
Professor Cartwright's losses

379
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
are caused by his own actions

380
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,520
It is the consequence of his actions

381
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040
May I ask Mr Diplomat,

382
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,440
If a British person

383
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,200
Has committed a crime overseas

384
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,320
Has murdered somebody,

385
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
And when the local government seeks to use the law

386
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,720
to punish him,

387
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
will the British Embassy raise an issue?

388
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,640
You are playing with the words

389
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,000
The British Embassy has stated very clearly in the note

390
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,040
That Professor Cartwright's teaching contract

391
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,440
is issued by the Chinese ministry of education

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
Peking University has no right to dismiss him

393
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
In addition, Professor Cartwright's teaching period is 4 years

394
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,600
The contract states that

395
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,600
There should be no early termination without good reason

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,320
Now, Peking University has unilaterally

397
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,360
dismissed a British citizen

398
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
which not only usurps power,

399
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,800
So it is reasonable if we

400
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,520
take action

401
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,000
and protect the rights of our citizens

402
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,760
Mr Minister

403
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,840
I'm afraid that you have no rights

404
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
to interfere in this issue

405
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,600
Peking University's actions

406
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,680
are completely legal

407
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
We have brought several documents

408
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,600
These documents from the Chinese education ministry

409
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,480
and Peking University regulations

410
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,280
Are sufficient to prove that

411
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Professor Cartwright's dismissal is legal

412
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,320
In addition, some of these documents

413
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,920
prove that

414
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,720
Professor Cartwright is completely incapable of

415
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,560
teaching at Peking University

416
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
He has also sevrely broken

417
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,880
Peking University's rules

418
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,560
All these prove that

419
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Professor Cartwright's dismissal is logical

420
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,840
Some might even say his dismissal is necessary

421
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
So,

422
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,760
I will now hand these documents to you

423
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
Please think about it

424
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,280
Professor Gu

425
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,080
I have once spent 2 silver dollars

426
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
to be able to buy a seat at your lecture

427
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
I have also remembered clearly what you have said

428
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,040
about the biggest difference between the Chinese and Europeans

429
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,120
was that the Chinese do things like children

430
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,320
According to how they feel in their hearts

431
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
While Europeans are more like adults

432
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,120
Relying on mature thinking

433
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
You are so right

434
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,080
The documents that you have provided us

435
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,600
are totally random

436
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,000
This is a document signed by Li Yuan Hong

437
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,800
This one signed by Hu Ren Yuan

438
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
This is by Fan Yuan Lian

439
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,400
And this

440
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,400
actually writted by Cai Yuan Pei

441
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,600
Your whole country

442
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,440
can change leaders at will, at every level

443
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
just like a kid playing games

444
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,200
Every new leader

445
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,280
has a new set of rules

446
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
Since you have provided so many documents

447
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,360
who do you want me to listen to?

448
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
Mr Diplomat

449
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,360
it seems like you have wasted your money

450
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
listening to my lecture

451
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,080
Clearly, you have misunderstood my teachings

452
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,240
I would like to remind you once again

453
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,760
your arrogance, bias and rudeness

454
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,600
are very rarely seen in the Chinese

455
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,680
Professor Gu

456
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,160
I'm not here to listen to a lecture

457
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,800
The United Kingdom is a country that respects human rights

458
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,560
and abides by contracts

459
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,040
In British Universities

460
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
there wouldn't be such violations

461
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,400
Prematurely terminating a foreign teacher

462
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
Mr Diplomat,

463
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,560
it seems like you have spent too much time in China

464
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,400
You have forgotten your own history

465
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,160
Let me give you a lesson

466
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,480
In 1886,

467
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,760
The University of Edinburgh once fired

468
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,320
2 professors who made a scene while drunk

469
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,400
In 1889,

470
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,920
the University of Oxford once fired 10 foreign professors

471
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,440
of which 8 of them had not completed their tenure

472
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
In 1902,

473
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
The University of Cambridge once fired

474
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,880
an American professor

475
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,800
and a Japanese Professor

476
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
In fact, this year due to the war,

477
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,040
Britian, France

478
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,040
and a few other countries

479
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,120
immediately fired all professors

480
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,320
and students from Germany and Austria-Hungary

481
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
I would like to ask you, Mr Diplomat

482
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,960
If you can do so,

483
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,040
Why can't we?

484
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,680
Is this your highly regarded

485
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,960
values of human rights, freedom and equality?

486
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,560
Professor Gu,

487
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,600
Thank you for bringing up the war

488
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,120
I would like to remind eveyrone seated here

489
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,880
that Britian and China are now working togther

490
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,240
Your actions have

491
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,560
affected the cooperation between the 2 countries

492
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,920
Have you thought about the consequences?

493
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,520
Can you afford to bear this responsibility

494
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,160
Mr Minister,

495
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,080
are you threatening us?

496
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,720
I am trying to get you to face the reality

497
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,360
that this matter has already attracted the

498
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
attention of the British Prime Minister

499
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,800
and also attracted the attention of The Chinese President and Premier

500
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,440
You are so obstinate

501
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
Does Cai Yuan Pei still want to be

502
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,440
the president of Peking University?

503
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,160
If we can go against our conscience,

504
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
and crumble under pressure

505
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,360
We would not be here to debate

506
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,360
I think we can end this negotiation

507
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,600
Mr Diplomat

508
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,520
Here you are

509
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,680
Take good care of it

510
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,160
Goodbye, gentlemen

511
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,240
Cartwright,

512
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I cannot do anything about it

513
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,600
Handle it yourself

514
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
I'll take them to court

515
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,920
I want to let you know

516
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,000
Chen Du Xiu is back

517
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,920
From what we know

518
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,240
it seems that Jordan doesn't care anymore

519
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,920
he wants to let Cartwright do whatever he wants

520
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
This matter is not so simple

521
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Jordan has called Duan Qi Rui

522
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,480
He still hopes the country honours the contract,

523
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,560
and hopes the government can interfere

524
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
Duan Qi Rui has called me

525
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
and suggested that we solve it amicably

526
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,480
to avoid the courts if possible

527
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,640
We are not the ones who wants to go to court

528
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,280
It is Cartwright who desires it

529
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,240
We can't possibly ignore it

530
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,000
We should definitely prepare for a lawsuit

531
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,800
I have already found 2 lawyers

532
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
There are Peking University professors

533
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,240
One is Wang Chong Hui

534
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,680
The other is Zhang Yao Zeng

535
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
They should be sufficient

536
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
That's great

537
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,080
There were both previous ministers of law

538
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,920
With the 2 of them,

539
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
we will definitely win

540
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,400
Going to court will be the last resort

541
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
I have discussed with Fu Zeng Xiang

542
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,960
It is of utmost importance

543
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,520
We will need to take down Cartwright's ego

544
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,960
to let him know the consequences

545
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
that if he continues to make a scene

546
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,160
he will be left with nothing

547
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
What do you think?

548
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
Expose all of Cartwright's wrongdoings

549
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,560
He will know who is stronger

550
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
Yes, make good use of the 2 cards up your sleeve

551
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,120
Cartwright, what is going on

552
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,400
Public opinion is overwhelming against the UK

553
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,200
You've caused the government lots of trouble

554
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,400
Many British people in China have lost face

555
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,640
How do you want this to end?

556
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,240
Jordan, we must not give in

557
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,880
We cannot lose to the Chinese

558
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,480
Call Duan Qi Rui

559
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,800
Put pressure on him

560
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,440
Let him replace Cai Yuan Pei

561
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,600
Cartwright

562
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,200
You're crazy

563
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,720
Wang Da Man isn't even returning my calls

564
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Much less Duan Qi Rui

565
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,720
Who do you think you are

566
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,120
Do you think you can reverse this whole situation?

567
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,560
I'll take them to court then

568
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,920
Do you think you can win?

569
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,200
You will only lose even worse

570
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,000
Do you know who their lawyers are?

571
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,680
One of them is Wang Chong Hui

572
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,600
An expert in English and American law

573
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,320
The other is Zhang Yao Zeng

574
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,880
An expert in civil law

575
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
They are both universally recognized as legal experts

576
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,280
and have served as chief justice of the Republic of China

577
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,720
Fight against them

578
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,120
and you will end up discredited and compromised

579
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,880
What should I do then?

580
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,320
You must help me find a solution

581
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,840
[?] Cartwright,

582
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,800
the Chinese have determined to fight us.

583
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,240
And we only suffer

584
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
greater losses if we persist in this.

585
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,640
Britain is now at war,

586
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,040
and I don't want to create more problems because of this matter.

587
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,560
Duan Qirui and Feng Guozhang

588
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,840
are fighting each other about affairs of the southern government.

589
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,320
We can't allow our affairs

590
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,240
to offend Cai Yuanpei and the students.

591
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480
No way.

592
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,800
We have to give up, Cartwright.

593
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,480
How?

594
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
How to give up?

595
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,320
Tomorrow, I will meet with Wang Daxie,

596
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,560
and ask him to mediate

597
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,840
and give us a way out.

598
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,280
Listening to Beethoven's "Symphony of Heroes".

599
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,760
Probably something good is going on.

600
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,040
I was waiting for you.

601
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,360
Good.

602
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
Come, come. Please sit.

603
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Tell me, what's the good news?

604
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,600
Early this morning,

605
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,080
Jordan made an urgent appointment with me

606
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
regarding the Cartwright matter,

607
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,160
saying that there were new instructions from the British government.

608
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,160
I was waiting

609
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000
until noon just to see him.

610
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,600
Right, waiting that long.

611
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,160
As soon as we met, Jordan told me

612
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,400
that Prime Minister Lloyd George considered

613
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,800
China and the United Kingdom as allies.

614
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,440
He decided to downplay

615
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,520
Cartwright's dismissal from the overall situation,

616
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,360
respect the ruling of Peking University

617
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,520
and let Cartwright come home as soon as possible.

618
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,800
Does Lloyd George have the luxury

619
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,840
to take care of this matter?

620
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,200
It's just an excuse.

621
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:01,920
Is it?

622
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,760
Jordan said

623
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,560
they have persuaded Cartwright to drop the lawsuit

624
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,160
and stop getting entangled with Peking University.

625
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
I hope Peking University will compromise

626
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,400
and give Cartwright a way out.

627
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080
What kind of way out does he want?

628
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,240
Jordan said that he hoped that Peking University

629
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400
would stop spreading the Cartwright affair

630
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,160
to Chinese and foreign media.

631
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,240
At the same time, he hoped

632
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,440
that Cartwright would be financially compensated.

633
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200
This Jordan is very cunning.

634
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,600
If we pay the financial compensation,

635
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,840
doesn't that mean we admit that we are at fault?

636
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,040
We can't agree to this.

637
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
Let me finish what I have to say.

638
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960
This afternoon, the Prime Minister's Office called me

639
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,640
and Fu Zengxiang separately

640
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
to convey Duan Qirui's instructions

641
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,240
that the British should not ask for too much, should cooperate

642
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,320
and not cause any trouble.

643
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,280
This old Duan.

644
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,280
He's afraid of the British.

645
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,040
I and Fu Zengxiang worked together.

646
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,800
The result has exceeded our expectation.

647
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,240
As for the financial compensation,

648
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,400
it can be resolved by the Ministry of Education.

649
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,680
The reason is that Cartwright signed his contract

650
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,760
with the Ministry of Education.

651
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,920
Do you think it's fine?

652
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,320
I think so.

653
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,200
Can we make him an offer?

654
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,680
Tell me.

655
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,840
Let Cartwright come to Peking University

656
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
in front of all the teachers and students

657
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,800
to sign the letter of termination.

658
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,160
I think that's feasible.

659
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,040
Jordan said that both sides should give him a way out,

660
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,040
and I will give him a note early tomorrow morning.

661
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,080
Good.

662
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,480
Brother Botang.

663
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,160
Then I'll go back and wait for your good news.

664
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,120
Good.

665
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,880
Yucai, this building looks old.

666
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,719
[Beijing Shaoxing Guildhall Bushu Bookstore]

667
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,680
This Shaoxing Guildhall

668
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,588
[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian, Peking University Professor]

669
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,200
was built in the sixth year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign (1826).

670
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,360
It was formerly known as Shanyin Huiji Liangyi Guildhall,

671
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,320
is mainly used to entertain Juren (imperial bureaucratic rank) from Shanyin and Huiji counties

672
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,000
who are going to Beijing to take the exam.

673
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,920
It has been nearly a hundred years, right?

674
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,151
[Zhou Shuren (Lu Xun), styled Yucai, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

675
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,360
This place has been through so much.

676
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,400
Even the ancients inscriptions are older than this house.

677
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
It's reminiscent of ancient times.

678
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,160
Studying Buddhist scriptures and copying ancient tablets

679
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,320
is Yucai's daily habit now.

680
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,600
I heard that

681
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,040
there was a woman who hanged herself in this house.

682
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,120
No, that was outside that door.

683
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,121
[Zhou Zuoren, styled Xingbiao, Peking University Professor]

684
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,280
So no one dares to live in this house,

685
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
except my brother.

686
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,080
Brother Yucai, aren't you depressed when you live here?

687
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,800
Depressed,

688
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,080
I'm not the only one who's depressed in this tree-mending (=Bushu) bookstore.

689
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,680
Outside the bookstore,

690
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,160
the rancid air was unbearable.

691
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
I saw the Xinhai Revolution in those years.

692
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Then the Second Revolution.

693
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,960
Then Yuan Shikai's self-proclaimation as Emperor and the Zhang Xun Restoration.

694
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,840
It seems that this society is rotten.

695
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,520
With no cure at all.

696
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,800
Brother Yucai, I thought

697
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,120
that since Heaven created Man,

698
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
it should give them a way out.

699
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,000
There is still a cure.

700
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,320
Only someone needs to find it.

701
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,600
Where's the cure?

702
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,360
Who is the person looking for the cure?

703
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,480
Me.

704
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,720
Us.

705
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,920
This cure is your masterpiece, Brother Yucai.

706
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,680
"New Youth",

707
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,800
I've read it.

708
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,840
Lukewarm water is not enough.

709
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,840
Please ask Brother Yucai to enlighten me.

710
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,200
First, you advocate vernacular,

711
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,920
but I write in classical Chinese and semi-classical Chinese.

712
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,240
"Holding a pipa that half hides the face."
(Verse from "Pipa xing" (816))

713
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,280
Second, to advocate and popularize vernacular

714
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,400
is to have works that are popular with the public.

715
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,600
I think

716
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,640
writing novels in vernacular

717
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,120
is the best way to popularize vernacular,

718
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,000
but you just don't have any works in this form.

719
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,800
Third, and most importantly,

720
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,720
you keep saying that you want to declare war against the Three Fundamental Bonds of Confucianism.

721
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,960
But it's all about great principles,

722
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,400
and most people's understanding is not profound.

723
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,160
It's impossible to touch people's souls

724
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
without thinking in images.

725
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,240
Yucai,

726
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,760
I've learnt so much,

727
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
what you just said has been enlightening,

728
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,880
and gets to the heart of "New Youth".

729
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,720
Sir,

730
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,800
now that we have our doctor,

731
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,200
please perform your operation.

732
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,040
Stop sitting on the sidelines.

733
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
No more "holding a pipa that half hides the face".

734
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,360
Be bold and resolute, Yucai.

735
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,040
I will try.

736
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,320
Great!

737
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,120
Just waiting for you to say this.

738
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,880
Yucai, as long as you strike hard,

739
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,640
you will definitely become a banner.

740
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,240
Brother Yucai,

741
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,360
I regret that we didn't meet sooner.

742
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,000
Yucai,

743
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,240
the trip was well worthwhile. I'm glad to hear the good news.

744
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,880
Then let's go now.

745
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,240
I am waiting for your cure.

746
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:35,486
Arrives and leaves in a hurry.

747
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,000
Like the autumn wind sweeping the fallen leaves.

748
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,960
I've already heard of this once before.

749
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,240
But it can also be seen that this person

750
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,000
has great charm.

751
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,120
He's able to recruit people with high ideals to do things for them in the future.

752
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,280
Deqian doesn't say much.

753
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,360
I also like that Shouchang.

754
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
He acts steady and modest.

755
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,560
I believe he can do great things in the future.

756
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,440
Oh right, several old classmates,

757
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,840
such as Ren Guangming of Nanjing Navy Academy, came to Beijing to meet you.

758
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,320
They wanted to catch up with you.

759
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,480
Are they here for the Ministry of Education?

760
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,120
Why don't they come to me directly?

761
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,560
Everyone knows you are in a bad mood.

762
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,920
They don't dare disturb you.

763
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,560
It's a pleasure

764
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,920
to have friends from afar.

765
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,880
Please arrange it. I'll ask them to rinse the pot.

766
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,880
Alright.

767
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,320
Sir,

768
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,000
do you think I understand this part correctly?

769
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,720
Let me see.

770
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,440
This part

771
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,200
is right in general.

772
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,040
Thank you, sir.

773
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,600
Very well.

774
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,720
Hello, sir.

775
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,920
Excuse me.

776
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,960
Hello.

777
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,000
Excuse me, where is Professor Hu Shizhi's office?

778
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:53,791
[Wang Mengzou, Manager of Yadong Library]

779
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,600
Hu Shizhi?

780
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,200
You see that, open the door.

781
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,080
There are some ladies laughing in that room.

782
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,600
Thank you.

783
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,760
Doctor Hu,

784
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,160
how do you write vernacular poems

785
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,440
to make them catchy?

786
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,120
She asked this question well.

787
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,800
Mr. Huang Zunxian said that

788
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,557
I wrote my mouth with my own handwriting.

789
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:29,968
I wrote my mouth with my own handwriting.

790
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,080
Thank you.

791
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
What does that mean?

792
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,000
Actually, the reason is very simple.

793
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,840
Without emotion,

794
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,440
without thought, vernacular poetry

795
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,080
is like a poem without mind.

796
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,600
Who can not love beauty

797
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,360
in this world

798
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,280
like a beauty without emotion?

799
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,480
Who would love a zombie

800
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,320
without emotion or mind?

801
00:40:56,963 --> 00:40:57,551
Zombie!

802
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,840
Brother Mengzou.

803
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,280
Come in!

804
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
Sorry, everyone.

805
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,160
there is a guest here.

806
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,440
Let's talk next time.

807
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,560
How can this be over before it's fun?

808
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,440
Awfully sorry.

809
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,480
Professor Hu.

810
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,040
Can I have a Western-style farewell with you?

811
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,000
Of course.

812
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,760
Goodbye, Doctor Hu.

813
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,480
Thank you.
