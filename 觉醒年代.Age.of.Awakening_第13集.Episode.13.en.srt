238
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:35,920


239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,720


240
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,600


241
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,160


242
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,800


243
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,360


244
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,040


245
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,120


246
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,960


247
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,800


248
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120


249
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,520


250
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,720


251
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,960


252
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,440


253
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600


254
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,480


255
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,280


256
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,120


257
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,800


258
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,480


259
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200


260
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,880


261
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040


262
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,000


263
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160


264
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,440


265
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040


266
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160


267
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960


268
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,200


269
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,200


270
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040


271
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,160


272
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,160


273
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,320


274
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,280


275
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920


276
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
The Chinese guests will soon arrive

277
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,760
Is everything ready

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,280
Yes, everything is ready

279
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,240
Jordan

280
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,680
The people that are coming today

281
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,240
Are top talents from Peking University

282
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,880
All of them are good at debate

283
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,480
So be careful

284
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,640
Don't be fooled by them

285
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,160
Don't worry, Cartwright

286
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,600
Peking University has sent

287
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,640
A strange negotiating team today

288
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,400
The leading figures from the old and the new culture

289
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,960
will be present in the meeting

290
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,520
This will be our honour

291
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,960
To give them an opportunity

292
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,640
To hold a cultural debate here

293
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
Are you referring to Hong Ming?

294
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,840
Exactly

295
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,280
From what I know,

296
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
Hong Ming is

297
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,120
Chen Du Xiu and Hu She's sworn enemy

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
So you're saying

299
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
you will make them quarrel here?

300
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,600
If it happens

301
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,280
It would be a good show for us

302
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:34,800
Indeed

303
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
Today you are the main speaker

304
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,280
At the debate later

305
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,320
You will be the first speaker

306
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,440
Don't worry, I know

307
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
Let us prepare first

308
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,360
Gentlemen, please have a seat

309
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Let me introduce you to

310
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,600
This is the diplomat from the British Embassy,

311
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,800
Mr Jordan

312
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
This is the first secretary from the embassy

313
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,800
Mr Charles

314
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
And I am sure you all must know

315
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,040
Mr Cartwright

316
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,560
You should address me as Professor Cartwright

317
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,280
This is the dean of Liberal Arts of Peking University

318
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
Professor Chen Du Xiu

319
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
This is Professor Hu She

320
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,000
This is

321
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,920
Professor Gu

322
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,520
I welcome you here

323
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,800
This is Mr Li Da Zhao

324
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,040
One behalf of the British Embassy

325
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,240
I welcome all Peking University professors

326
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,960
especially Professor Gu Hong Ming

327
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,120
who is highly respected by us westerners

328
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
It is a great honour and pleasure

329
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
To be able to negotiate with Professor Gu personally

330
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,840
Let's get started

331
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,360
Who is going to talk first

332
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
Professor Hu She is Peking University's main speaker

333
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,440
Let Professor Hu She begin

334
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
Good morning, gentlemen

335
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm really astonished by the note of protest

336
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,640
against wrongful and unfair dismissal

337
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,680
of Professor Cartwright from his position

338
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,680
at Peking University

339
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,200
Things like dismissal of the foreign teachers from Peking University

340
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,680
are common situations

341
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,440
in education management

342
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,040
According to students' complaints,

343
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,240
Peking University has carried out a thorough investigation

344
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,600
of Professor Cartwright's teaching level,

345
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
attitudes

346
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
behaviour and other aspects.

347
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,880
The investigation has revealed

348
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,160
As a result, large amount of evidence indicated that

349
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,680
Professor Cartwright

350
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,560
Is not competent at his job at all

351
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,160
Furthermore

352
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
He violated university rules

353
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,680
which brought negative impact

354
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,400
and irretrievable loss

355
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,600
Therefore, based on relevant regulation

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,960
and rules made by the government and the university

357
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,960
the review committee decided to discharge Mr Cartwright from his position

358
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
This is our internal affair

359
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
It has nothing to do with

360
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,680
The British Government or the British embassy

361
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,920
Professor Hu

362
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
You sound like you are not here to negotiate

363
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,600
But to denouce us

364
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,240
Professor Cartwright is a British citizen

365
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,880
He was introduced by the British embassy

366
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,960
to the Chinese education ministry

367
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
to teach at Peking University

368
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
Now, his interests in China have been damaged

369
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
Certainly, the British Embassy cannot ignore it

370
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
Moreover,

371
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,680
It is a sacred and undeniable right to protest

372
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,520
Professor Cartwright's losses

373
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
are caused by his own actions

374
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,520
It is the consequence of his actions

375
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040
May I ask Mr Diplomat,

376
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,440
If a British person

377
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,200
Has committed a crime overseas

378
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,320
Has murdered somebody,

379
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
And when the local government seeks to use the law

380
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,720
to punish him,

381
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
will the British Embassy raise an issue?

382
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,640
You are playing with the words

383
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,000
The British Embassy has stated very clearly in the note

384
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,040
That Professor Cartwright's teaching contract

385
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,440
is issued by the Chinese ministry of education

386
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
Peking University has no right to dismiss him

387
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
In addition, Professor Cartwright's teaching period is 4 years

388
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,600
The contract states that

389
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,600
There should be no early termination without good reason

390
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,320
Now, Peking University has unilaterally

391
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,360
dismissed a British citizen

392
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
which not only usurps power,

393
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,800
So it is reasonable if we

394
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,520
take action

395
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,000
and protect the rights of our citizens

396
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,760
Mr Minister

397
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,840
I'm afraid that you have no rights

398
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
to interfere in this issue

399
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,600
Peking University's actions

400
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,680
are completely legal

401
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
We have brought several documents

402
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,600
These documents from the Chinese education ministry

403
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,480
and Peking University regulations

404
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,280
Are sufficient to prove that

405
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Professor Cartwright's dismissal is legal

406
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,320
In addition, some of these documents

407
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,920
prove that

408
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,720
Professor Cartwright is completely incapable of

409
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,560
teaching at Peking University

410
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
He has also sevrely broken

411
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,880
Peking University's rules

412
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,560
All these prove that

413
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Professor Cartwright's dismissal is logical

414
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,840
Some might even say his dismissal is necessary

415
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
So,

416
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,760
I will now hand these documents to you

417
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
Please think about it

418
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,280
Professor Gu

419
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,080
I have once spent 2 silver dollars

420
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
to be able to buy a seat at your lecture

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
I have also remembered clearly what you have said

422
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,040
about the biggest difference between the Chinese and Europeans

423
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,120
was that the Chinese do things like children

424
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,320
According to how they feel in their hearts

425
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
While Europeans are more like adults

426
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,120
Relying on mature thinking

427
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
You are so right

428
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,080
The documents that you have provided us

429
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,600
are totally random

430
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,000
This is a document signed by Li Yuan Hong

431
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,800
This one signed by Hu Ren Yuan

432
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
This is by Fan Yuan Lian

433
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,400
And this

434
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,400
actually writted by Cai Yuan Pei

435
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,600
Your whole country

436
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,440
can change leaders at will, at every level

437
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
just like a kid playing games

438
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,200
Every new leader

439
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,280
has a new set of rules

440
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
Since you have provided so many documents

441
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,360
who do you want me to listen to?

442
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
Mr Diplomat

443
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,360
it seems like you have wasted your money

444
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
listening to my lecture

445
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,080
Clearly, you have misunderstood my teachings

446
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,240
I would like to remind you once again

447
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,760
your arrogance, bias and rudeness

448
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,600
are very rarely seen in the Chinese

449
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,680
Professor Gu

450
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,160
I'm not here to listen to a lecture

451
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,800
The United Kingdom is a country that respects human rights

452
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,560
and abides by contracts

453
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,040
In British Universities

454
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
there wouldn't be such violations

455
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,400
Prematurely terminating a foreign teacher

456
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
Mr Diplomat,

457
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,560
it seems like you have spent too much time in China

458
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,400
You have forgotten your own history

459
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,160
Let me give you a lesson

460
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,480
In 1886,

461
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,760
The University of Edinburgh once fired

462
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,320
2 professors who made a scene while drunk

463
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,400
In 1889,

464
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,920
the University of Oxford once fired 10 foreign professors

465
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,440
of which 8 of them had not completed their tenure

466
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
In 1902,

467
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
The University of Cambridge once fired

468
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,880
an American professor

469
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,800
and a Japanese Professor

470
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
In fact, this year due to the war,

471
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,040
Britian, France

472
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,040
and a few other countries

473
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,120
immediately fired all professors

474
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,320
and students from Germany and Austria-Hungary

475
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
I would like to ask you, Mr Diplomat

476
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,960
If you can do so,

477
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,040
Why can't we?

478
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,680
Is this your highly regarded

479
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,960
values of human rights, freedom and equality?

480
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,560
Professor Gu,

481
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,600
Thank you for bringing up the war

482
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,120
I would like to remind eveyrone seated here

483
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,880
that Britian and China are now working togther

484
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,240
Your actions have

485
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,560
affected the cooperation between the 2 countries

486
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,920
Have you thought about the consequences?

487
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,520
Can you afford to bear this responsibility

488
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,160
Mr Minister,

489
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,080
are you threatening us?

490
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,720
I am trying to get you to face the reality

491
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,360
that this matter has already attracted the

492
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
attention of the British Prime Minister

493
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,800
and also attracted the attention of The Chinese President and Premier

494
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,440
You are so obstinate

495
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
Does Cai Yuan Pei still want to be

496
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,440
the president of Peking University?

497
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,160
If we can go against our conscience,

498
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
and crumble under pressure

499
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,360
We would not be here to debate

500
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,360
I think we can end this negotiation

501
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,600
Mr Diplomat

502
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,520
Here you are

503
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,680
Take good care of it

504
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,160
Goodbye, gentlemen

505
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,240
Cartwright,

506
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I cannot do anything about it

507
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,600
Handle it yourself

508
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
I'll take them to court

509
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,920
I want to let you know

510
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,000
Chen Du Xiu is back

511
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,920
From what we know

512
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,240
it seems that Jordan doesn't care anymore

513
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,920
he wants to let Cartwright do whatever he wants

514
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
This matter is not so simple

515
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Jordan has called Duan Qi Rui

516
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,480
He still hopes the country honours the contract,

517
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,560
and hopes the government can interfere

518
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
Duan Qi Rui has called me

519
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
and suggested that we solve it amicably

520
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,480
to avoid the courts if possible

521
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,640
We are not the ones who wants to go to court

522
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,280
It is Cartwright who desires it

523
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,240
We can't possibly ignore it

524
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,000
We should definitely prepare for a lawsuit

525
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,800
I have already found 2 lawyers

526
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
There are Peking University professors

527
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,240
One is Wang Chong Hui

528
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,680
The other is Zhang Yao Zeng

529
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
They should be sufficient

530
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
That's great

531
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,080
There were both previous ministers of law

532
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,920
With the 2 of them,

533
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
we will definitely win

534
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,400
Going to court will be the last resort

535
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
I have discussed with Fu Zeng Xiang

536
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,960
It is of utmost importance

537
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,520
We will need to take down Cartwright's ego

538
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,960
to let him know the consequences

539
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
that if he continues to make a scene

540
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,160
he will be left with nothing

541
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
What do you think?

542
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
Expose all of Cartwright's wrongdoings

543
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,560
He will know who is stronger

544
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
Yes, make good use of the 2 cards up your sleeve

545
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,120
Cartwright, what is going on

546
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,400
Public opinion is overwhelming against the UK

547
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,200
You've caused the government lots of trouble

548
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,400
Many British people in China have lost face

549
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,640
How do you want this to end?

550
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,240
Jordan, we must not give in

551
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,880
We cannot lose to the Chinese

552
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,480
Call Duan Qi Rui

553
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,800
Put pressure on him

554
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,440
Let him replace Cai Yuan Pei

555
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,600
Cartwright

556
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,200
You're crazy

557
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,720
Wang Da Man isn't even returning my calls

558
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Much less Duan Qi Rui

559
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,720
Who do you think you are

560
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,120
Do you think you can reverse this whole situation?

561
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,560
I'll take them to court then

562
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,920
Do you think you can win?

563
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,200
You will only lose even worse

564
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,000
Do you know who their lawyers are?

565
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,680
One of them is Wang Chong Hui

566
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,600
An expert in English and American law

567
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,320
The other is Zhang Yao Zeng

568
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,880
An expert in civil law

569
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
They are both universally recognized as legal experts

570
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,280
and have served as chief justice of the Republic of China

571
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,720
Fight against them

572
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,120
and you will end up discredited and compromised

573
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,880
What should I do then?

574
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,320
You must help me find a solution

575
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,840


576
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,800


577
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,240


578
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080


579
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,640


580
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,040


581
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,560


582
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,840


583
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,320


584
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,240


585
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480


586
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,800


587
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,480


588
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840


589
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,320


590
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,560


591
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,840


592
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,280


593
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,760


594
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,040


595
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,360


596
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240


597
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720


598
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,600


599
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,080


600
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600


601
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,160


602
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,160


603
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000


604
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,600


605
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,160


606
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,400


607
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,800


608
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,440


609
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,520


610
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,360


611
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,520


612
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,800


613
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,840


614
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,200


615
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:01,920


616
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,760


617
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,560


618
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,160


619
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720


620
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,400


621
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080


622
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,240


623
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400


624
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,160


625
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,240


626
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,440


627
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200


628
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,600


629
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,840


630
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,040


631
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320


632
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960


633
