[Episode Forty-three]

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,080
So I hope

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,360
we the Peking University Marxist Theory Research Society

5
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,170
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,800
and the soon-to-be-established

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,120
Beijing branch of the Communist Party of China

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
must actively participate in these two great debates.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
Make our stance clear.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,480
"New Youth"

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
and the upcoming "Communist Party" magazine

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,160
are our position.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,680
Hurrah!

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,640
Brother Jiemin, you're going abroad for a study tour.

15
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:47,839
[Shanghai]

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,400
If you hadn't left from Shanghai,

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,600
I will try my best to see you off in Beijing.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,040
At Peking University,

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,520
there are two initiatives can be credited to you.

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,320
One, reform in education.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,760
It has changed the mindset and virtue

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,280
of a generation of scholars

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,840
and promoted the development of the New Culture Movement.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,240
The second is compatibility and inclusiveness.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,040
In Peking University, there are various doctrines

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,880
that can be studied as one wishes,

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,560
so it is not enough to take into account the ruin and reputation,

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,480
but what is valuable to the trend

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
is also the spirit.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,720
I admire it.

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,720
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu]

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
Zhongfu, you flatter me.

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,040
Brother Botang.

34
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,160
I should really thank you for all these years.

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,840
Thank you, brother Botang.

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,120
All these years have given me so many ideas.

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,160
Jiemin, you really have to thank me.

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,800
Your time at Peking University

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
will be unforgettable for the rest of your life.

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,920
Zhongfu.

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,240
I hear there's another fight between you.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
What are you crazy about Wu?

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,880
Controversies on socialism.

44
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,640
You criticized Zhang Dongsun.

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,320
Controversies on anarchism.

46
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,840
You criticized Huang Lingshuang.

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,120
When are you going to

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,800
criticize I Wu Zhihui and Chen Yannian?

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,080
Let me tell you something.

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
I can save your face.

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,960
You followed Russell, I didn't point it out.

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,760
You encouraged Huang Lingshuang to quit the Communist Party.

53
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,280
I'm not arguing with you either.

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
Because we're not

55
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,440
cars in the same lane,

56
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,560
there is no need to quarrel.

57
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,560
But I have to warn you about one thing.

58
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Don't touch Yannian and Qiaonian again.

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
What kind of path they want to choose

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,680
is their own choice.

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,440
You have no right to interfere.

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,600
I took an oath long ago.

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
I don't care about your family's mess.

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,880
In a Shanghai we have a saying,

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
"I don't get along with you".

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,000
Zhongfu, as a brother,

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
I have a few words of truth to tell you.

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,240
People often say that different things do not work together.

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,040
You and I have different ways,

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,560
but we can work together.

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,280
The New Culture Movement is you, Shouchang, Shizhi,

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
and Mr. Lu Xun.

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
You guys started this.

74
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,720
Now some differences are inevitable.

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,320
But don't let this

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
and hurt your kindness to each other.

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
Before I came here this time,

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,680
I told Shizhi.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,520
He wants to come to Shanghai and have a good talk with you.

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
Sir, you are right.

81
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:08,645
[Cai Yuanpei, educator, President of Peking University from 1917 to 1927. Died in Hong Kong in 1940, aged 72.]

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
Recently, I have planned to

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,240
to invite Shouchang and Shizhi to Shanghai for a get-together.

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,400
Excellent.

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
Shouchang, Shizhi.

86
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840
I will go to Guangzhou soon.

87
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,200
This time, my family moved south to Guangdong for schooling.

88
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm afraid I'm going to live there for a while.

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
What worries me is what to do with "New Youth".

90
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,040
It's everyone's child.

91
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,560
What should it be a home for?

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,240
This needs to be decided by everyone.

93
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,200
For this reason, I have written to

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,960
Deqian, Yucai, and others

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
to ask for their opinions.

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,240
I sincerely invite you both to come to Shanghai for a get-together

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
to discuss and solve this problem together.

98
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
I warmly look forward to you.

99
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,200
It is almost as hard for friends to meet as for the morning and evening stars.

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,720
Shouchang, Shizhi.

101
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,760
Thank you for taking the time to gather in Shanghai.

102
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,520
It's a relief for me!

103
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
Talents have been hated for thousands of years since ancient times,

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
and they are still willing to make Erguotou.

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
This is what I said when I first met Shizhi.

106
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,440
Shizhi, remember?

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,320
Of course I remember.

108
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,440
My first day in Beijing,

109
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,400
you and Mr. Cai invited me to dinner at the scholar's residence

110
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,760
to drink Erguotou.

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,920
Why, where shall we drink today?

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,600
In the countryside.

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,080
Let's drink and talk.

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,280
Come, brother Zhongfu.

115
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
I'd like to congratulate you first

116
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
on your honorable appointment as the Chairman of the Education Committee of the Guangdong Government.

117
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,120
This is a big position.

118
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
I decided to go to Guangzhou

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,720
not to be an official.

120
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,080
I want to do something for the backward education in China.

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
Just like when we started "New Youth",

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,200
wasn't it also to enlighten people's minds

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,640
and improve their quality?

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,000
You mentioned "New Youth".

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,960
I was just going to ask you,

126
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,400
why has

127
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,840
a very good "New Youth"

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
become a publication of the Party?

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
Is the current "New Youth"

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
still the academic journal of enlightenment?

131
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,440
Now that we're here.

132
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
Then let's discuss this matter.

133
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,360
Before,

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
I wrote to my colleagues in Beijing for advice.

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
They wrote that

136
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,160
all the opinions have been summarized to Shizhi.

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,640
Then Shizhi, tell me first.

138
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
I am not satisfied with the present situation of "New Youth".

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
Several schemes are put forward for you to choose from.

140
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,000
All the opinions are summarized in Shouchang's place.

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
Shouchang, tell me first.

142
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,720
Alright.

143
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,840
Since brother Zhongfu is going to work in Guangdong,

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,720
Shizhi proposed three schemes.

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
The first one is to run another publication in Beijing.

146
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,560
The second one is to move "New Youth" to Beijing.

147
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,240
but to make a declaration that it will not talk about politics.

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,040
The third, suspension.

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,480
These three opinions

150
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
Everyone is unanimously opposed.

151
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
Everyone finally agreed

152
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
since Zhongfu has no time to take care of it,

153
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,560
the editor of "New Youth",

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,160
you can move "New Youth" to Beijing.

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,200
But what to do after moving to Beijing,

156
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
we are very divided and can not be unified

157
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,160
Later, most people agreed with

158
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,600
Mr. Lu Xun's suggestion.

159
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
Leaving the decision on the "New Youth"

160
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,560
to Zhongfu.

161
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
Because "New Youth",

162
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
is Zhongfu's creation after all.

163
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,520
Shizhi, am I right to say that?

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,640
You're right.

165
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,960
But I personally don't agree.

166
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,880
The opinion of this majority

167
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
I also want to ask Zhongfu.

168
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,920
If you are in Guangdong,

169
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
how can "New Youth" succeed?

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,560
Where will it settle down?

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
Who will preside over the editing?

172
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
"New Youth" will stay in Shanghai.

173
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
Chen Wangdao will be the editor.

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,240
Agreed.

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,040
I have no objection.

176
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
But I am really disappointed.

177
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,760
I am also very sad.

178
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Shizhi, today, we're drinking wine and talking in the countryside.

179
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Speak up if you have anything to say.

180
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,480
I am sad for the split of "New Youth".

181
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,240
I am sad for your stubbornness.

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
More sad for your future.

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,760
Are we friends?

184
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
I can't convince you, let alone stop you.

185
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,960
I'm out of words now.

186
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,840
I'm only disappointed and sad.

187
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
Shizhi.

188
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,000
I invited you and Shouchang to Shanghai today.

189
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
For "New Youth",

190
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
I also want us to exchange ideas together.

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
It must be admitted,

192
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,600
after the baptism of the May Fourth Movement

193
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
we had great differences

194
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,760
in our country's political position.

195
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,320
Shouchang and I have made it clear

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
to ultimately choose Marxism,

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,040
and hope to go on

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
the road of Russia's October Revolution

199
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
to save China.

200
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
And finally, build

201
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,880
a socialist country where the people are the masters of the country.

202
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
This is my common ideal and pursuit with Shouchang.

203
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Your common ideal and pursuit.

204
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,600
Everyone knows this.

205
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,280
I was in the Red Building of Peking University two days ago.

206
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,600
I heard some classmates singing a ballad.

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
Two giants of the Peking University Red Building.

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,480
Northern Li and Southern Chen are widely spread.

209
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
The lone pine stands alone like a rafter pen.

210
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
The sun, moon and stars shine in the past and present.

211
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,640
But this is their opinion.

212
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,880
And I disagree with the beliefs

213
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
of the two of you.

214
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,280
You say socialism can save China.

215
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
Why then does Germany, the birthplace of socialism,

216
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,480
not engage in socialism?

217
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
How many years has it been since the Russian revolution?

218
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
What makes you conclude that it is suitable for China?

219
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
My opinion is that

220
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
China must copy the American system.

221
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
I studied in America for seven years.

222
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,640
I have seen it through my own long-term personal experience

223
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,520
and reached my conclusion.

224
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,480
What about you? Where did your conclusion come from?

225
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,640
Shizhi.

226
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,400
I used to cross the ocean with brother Zhongfu

227
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
to seek truth.

228
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,480
After so many years of ups and downs,

229
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,160
after numerous choices and explorations,

230
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
now we have finally determined a direction.

231
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
Marxism is a scientific truth.

232
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,840
The October Revolution is our example.

233
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,680
The Western democracy you worship

234
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
doesn't work in China.

235
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,360
Socialism can save the labouring masses.

236
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,880
For this beautiful ideal,

237
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
I am willing to give my all.

238
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,680
Shizhi, I believe

239
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,480
the Communist Party of China we established today

240
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
is not just my choice with Shouchang,

241
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,840
it is also a historical choice.

242
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,280
I believe there will be more and more Chinese people

243
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,840
who will agree to join this choice.

244
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay. Okay.

245
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm a minority today.

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,200
I won't argue with you.

247
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
I thought since it was a choice.

248
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
Friends should allow people to have their own interests.

249
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
A gentleman gets along with others, but not necessarily agrees with them.

250
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,480
The three of us are here today,

251
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,760
although the faith is different, the friendship is deep.

252
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
Only in this regard,

253
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
is it more precious.

254
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,160
A good friendship is precious.

255
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
I agree.

256
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
Shizhi, Shouchang.

257
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,600
The three of us should always be honest with each other.

258
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
As for the choice of faith,

259
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,320
lLet's leave it to history to judge.

260
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
We got drunk in countryside today.

261
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
Tomorrow will be separated by mountains.

262
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,880
The world is boundless.

263
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,200
Spring trees in Northern Wei,

264
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,280
sunset clouds in Eastern Jiang River.

265
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
When can we drink,

266
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
and discuss our poems again?

267
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:27,046
[Hu Shi, advocate of the New Culture Movement, literary scholar, and philosopher. Died in Taipei in 1962, aged 71.]

268
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,706
[Paris, France]

269
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,360
I have been in France for so long.

270
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
Haven't you had a jiaozi yet?

271
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,280
Let you taste my craft today.

272
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,163
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiangyu]

273
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,080
Okay.

274
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,440
I can finally eat jiaozi.

275
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:34,960
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

276
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,968
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

277
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,680
Yannian.

278
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
This is from Mr. Zhongfu.

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,640
I was told to give it to you by hand.

280
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,000
This is the fourth batch.

281
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
It seems that if I don't follow my father,

282
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,960
it's impossible for him to give up.

283
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,960
I heard it from Mr. Zhongfu with my own ears.

284
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Qiaonian, Yannian, if you don't believe in Marxism,

285
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,720
he will not die in peace.

286
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,040
Then please go back and tell him.

287
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Please rest assured.

288
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Our brothers' beliefs have changed.

289
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,440
Changed?

290
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,880
Yes, it has changed.

291
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,640
Great.

292
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,280
How did you turn around this corner?

293
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,320
It's not easy.

294
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
I've been in France for more than a year.

295
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,120
I see with my own eyes,

296
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,960
all the experiments failed.

297
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,080
Anarchism can't save the world.

298
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,520
Our belief in it in the past

299
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,840
can only be said to be built on quicksand.

300
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
Now I read these books

301
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,600
and ponder over and over.

302
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Marxism is science.

303
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,080
We want to dedicate this passion

304
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,480
to this wonderful ideal society.

305

Yannian.

306
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
Are you sure you want to break with anarchism?

307
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,280
Definitely.

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,640
Classmates.

309
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Today, it's representatives of our work-study students in France,

310
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,600
the Montagnards and Crusoeites.

311
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
Sitting together for the second time

312
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
to discuss joint operations.

313
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
The first time was to discuss the issue

314
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
of boycotting the Beiyang government's borrowing from France

315
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,320
and the purchase of arms.

316
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:06,109
[Chen Gongpei]

317
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,440
Today is the day to discuss the boycott

318
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,600
of Lyon Sino-French University's refusal to admit work-study students.

319
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,357
[Chen Yi]

[Li Weihan]

321
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,160
This is an issue that concerns

322
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
the fate and future of each of us students.

323
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,040
Next,

324
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
please Zhao Shiyan introduce the situation to everyone.

has been here in France for more than a year.

328
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,200
But so far,

329
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,800
except for a few government-funded students,

330
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,920
almost none of us

331
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
have been able to enter the school.

332
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,960
In January this year,

333
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,400
the Chinese law education society

334
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,400
announces decoupling from work-study students.

335
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
The French Embassy stopped paying

336
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,960
living expenses of work-study students.

337
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,920
Now,

Wu Zhihui, President of the Lyon Sino-French University,

339
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
cited the excuse that hardworking students

340
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,640
were too under-educated to pay their own way,

341
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,880
violating of previous commitments and agreements,

342
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,680
and unwilling to accept students studying in France for admission.

343
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
This is the worst thing

344
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,880
that could happen to us.

345
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,560
What little hope there was of going to school

346
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
was shamelessly cut off.

published the general enrollment brochure of Lyon University.

358
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
It clearly states

that if it is not a government fee or a guarantee of payment,

360

368
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,000
Didn't Wu Zhihui repeatedly claim

369
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,640
that he would give priority to the admission of two sons of Chen Duxiu

370
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
to the University of Lyon?

371
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,680
Runhuan, please rest assured.

372
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,520
Chen Yannian and Chen Qiaonian

373
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
must advance and retreat together.

374
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,480
If he Wu Zhihui reneges,

375
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,000
we two brothers will fight him to the end.

376
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,040
I propose

377
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,000
that all the work-study students rush to Lyon

378
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,520

Let's not get excited yet.

385
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,160
We should treat this question

more rationally.

387
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,360
I suggest

388
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120

389
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,160

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
There's just one last thing.

553
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,840
At the beginning of June 1921,

554
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
Communist International representative Marin

555
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,440
and foreign representative of the Communist International Far East Secretary

556
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,400
Nickelski arrived in Shanghai one after another.

557
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,160
After several conversations with Li Da and Li Hanjun,

558
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
they suggested to convene a national congress as soon as possible

559
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,720
and formally establish the Communist Party of China.

560
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,360
Li Da and Li Hanjun,

561
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,760
by writing letters

562
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
to Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao,

563
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,440
to hold the first national congress

564
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai.

565
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,450
[Shanghai Bowen Girls' School]

566
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,960
Jieshe.

567
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm so sorry.

568
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,920
I couldn't pick you up at the dock yesterday.

569
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,836
[Dong Biwu, styled Jieshe, Delegate of the CPC 1st National Congress]

570
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,840
I know that you are busy.

571
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,680
What you are doing now is a great thing

572
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,302
that will open up the world.

573
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:11,760
Open up the world?

574
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,400
Yes.

575
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,120
Good, this word is well used.

576
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
In the end, you're a great scholar.

577
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,520
You hit the nail on the head.

578
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,600
Jieshe.

579
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,120
But this epoch-making event is not easy to do.

580
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,840
These days, I'm in a mess.

581
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,040
It's a mess!

582
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,920
Otherwise, I will pick you up at the dock.

583
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,560
Now everyone says

584
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,280
that you, Li Hanjun, are the second brother of our party

585
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,120
This statement deserves its name.

586
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
Brother has no time to show up.

587
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
I have to be reluctant.

588
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,920
Jieshe.

589
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,840
You must help me more!

590
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,680
If this is not done well

591
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,000
then we'll all be sinners.

592
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,880
Communists are always at the call of the party.

593
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,560
If you have any tasks, you can arrange them.

594
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,000
Here.

595
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,280
This conference

596
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
discusses the main party program

597
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,480
and future practical work plan.

598
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,680
Everybody will discuss.

599
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,840
Please ask you and Zhang Guotao and I,

600
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,160
the three of us, to draft these two documents

601
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
according to the discussion.

602
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,440
Jieshe.

603
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
You are a scholar of the former Qing Dynasty

604
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,080
of outstanding talent.

605
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,880
This matter must belong to you.

606
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,280
No problem. You ask for it.

607
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
I'll make preparations now.

608
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,360
Good.

609
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,440
Then I'll prepare the materials for you.

610
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,160
This is the office of Bowen Girls' School

611
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,160
If you think it's noisy here,

612
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
you can move to my house to write.

613
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,600
It's nice here.

614
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,920
What questions can you discuss with your comrades?

615
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,520
Will the conference be held here?

616
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,720
For security,

617
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,520
it's better to hold the conference in my house.

618
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,080
Good.

619
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,640
Let's do it!

620
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,600
Seize all the time you can.

621
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,800
Right. Right.

622
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,480
Come in.

623
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,560
Excuse me, is this Mr. Dong Biwu?

624
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,160
Yes, I'm Dong Biwu.

625
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,520
You are?

626
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
Hello, sir.

627
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm Mao Zedong from Hunan.

628
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
Mao Zedong of Xinmin Society.

629
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,040
Yes.

630
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,560
Runzhi, come in, come in.

631
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,760
Please hold this for me first.

632
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,280
Okay.

633
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,800
When I was walking today,

634
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,800
I scraped some peach gum.

635
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,920
Just in time.

636
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
I've heard of frugality, sir.

637
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
I'm witnessing it today.

638
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm accustomed to frugality.

639
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,280
This brush will still work.

640
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
Runzhi, I have long wanted to see you.

641
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,880
Please sit down.

642
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,600
Please, sir.

643
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,280
Sir.

644
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,640
You are a senior.

645
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,240
Please give me more advice.

646
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,680
Now, I just have a problem.

647
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
I want to ask you for advice.

648
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
I know you sir are drafting

649
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,240
the Party program and work plan.

650
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,400
Is there anything I can do?

651
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,440
You can look forward to it.

652
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,040
Marx said

653
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,520
the Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class.

654
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,040
You said if the Communist Party of China

655
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
fits this nature?

656
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,880
I discussed it with some comrades.

657
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
We didn't arrive to a conclusion.

658
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,120
Sir.

659
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,880
You ask me such a question.

660
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
I must have learned something.

661
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,480
We did investigate and study

662
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,040
this question.

663
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
The founding of the Communist Party of China

664
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
was never the result of a dozen or so of us,

665
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,720
or more than fifty members of the Party nationwide,

666
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,680
stuck in our books and thinking about it.

667
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
It is also a product

668
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,200
of the combination of Marxism and the Chinese labor movement.

669
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
For example, in Wuhan,

670
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,960
there were more than 300,000 workers

671
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,720
and last year we investigated

672
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,480
the "Hankou Labor Conditions"

673
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,680
published in "New Youth".

674
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
This is the reality.

675
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,320
Yes.

676
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
I have read this investigation report.

677
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,840
Very persuasive.

678
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,560
I saw it with my own eyes.

679
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,440
Hunger quickly multiplies into death.

680
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,640
No clothes in winter or summer.

681
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
Only a broken sack

682
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,600
covering the lower body.

683
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
This is the present situation of the porters at the Yangtze River wharf.

684
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
They move around every day,

685
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,560
working overtime every day,

686
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,480
creating high value.

687
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,360
But they themselves are living a miserable life.

688
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,120
Is this their destiny?

689
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
No, absolutely not.

690
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
So they are especially equipped with

691
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,800
revolutionary spirit of resistance.

692
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,200
We have only been in Wuhan for three years.

693
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,840
There have been dozens of general strikes.

694
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,800
This fully shows

695
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,520
the strength and advancement of the Chinese working class.

696
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,640
yes.

697
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,560
The same is true in Changsha.

698
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,000
The working class

699
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
are always at the forefront of the struggle.

700
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,080
So I said to

701
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,840
the Party branch in Wuhan,

702
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,000
it's definitely not the creation of a few of our scholars.

703
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,120
Fundamentally speaking,

704
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,520
Wuhan now has the class base and social conditions

705
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
for the establishment of an advanced working class organization

706
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,560
with Marxism

707
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,840
as its guiding ideology.

708
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,040
Sir.

709
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,800
I totally agree with you.

710
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
The founding of the Communist Party of China

711
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,520
is more than just

712
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
the awakening of a handful of our intellectuals.

713
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,560
It is first and foremost the awakening of the Chinese working class.

714
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,800
It is the awakening of all Chinese people.

715
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,600
Is the great awakening of the Chinese nation.

716
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,680
The Communist Party of China represents

717
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,400
the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people.

718
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,080
This is our party's

719
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,880
rationality and science of its founding.

720
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,400
Moreso, it is the Communist Party of China's

721
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,480
fundamental driving force behind its vitality.

722
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,520
Great.

723
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
This problem is solved.

724
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,840
Runzhi.

725
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,080
You and I can talk all night.

726
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,960
Good.

727
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:08,469
[Guangzhou]

728
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,840
Sir, I was chosen to study in Moscow.

729
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,240
I have come to report to you on the work of the Socialist Youth League.

730
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,000
which will soon hold a conference with the first national congress

731
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,280
of the Communist Party of China.

732
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,040
We hope to be able to express our appreciation for the league's work

733
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
and give clearer instructions.

734
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,520
This time in order to make

735
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,520
the first Communist Party of China conference hold successfully,

736
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,280
I and Comrade Li Dazhao from Beijing

737
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,720
have done a lot of preparatory work,

738
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
including how to strengthen the work of the Socialist Youth League.

739
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,360
We all responded.

740
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
Bao Huiseng, as my designated representative,

741
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,080
have already set off with Chen Gongbo.

742
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
This time I believe

743
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,600
the first national congress of the Communist Party of China

744
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,880
will be a sign of formal establishment.

745
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,720
It will be a great success.

746
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,160
Unfortunately,

747
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm also the pre-university principal here,

748
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,160
I need to raise money.

749
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,600
I really can't get away.

750
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,000
Comrade Li Dazhao

751
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
also can't attend the meeting because of Peking University affairs.

752
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,960
This is a great pity.

753
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,560
However, sir, I'm sorry that you can't attend the meeting.

754
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,320
But the Communist Party of China will be born.

755
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,400
It will be an epoch-making event.

756
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,080
I believe it.

757
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,440
Zhongxie.

758
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,760
Aren't you going to attend the preparations?

759
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Is it the job of China Labor Union Secretariat?

760
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,280
How did you get to Guangdong?

761
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
I'm from Shanghai, Mr. Zhongfu.

762
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,400
I brought you two things.

763
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,640
What is it?

764
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,800
This is what Mr. Yi Baisha asked me to deliver to you

765
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,800
when he arrived in Shanghai last month.

766
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,080
Two days ago Mr. Yi Baisha went to Beijing alone

767
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,800
to assassinate Xu Shichang unsuccessfully.

768
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,600
He jumped into the sea angrily,

769
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,520
committing suicide.

770
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,680
What about the second thing?

771
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,160
This is just sent by Shiyan from France.

772
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,640
Lyrics of the "Internationale".

773
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,880
Do you know the lyrics of these last chorus?

774
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,720
Who translated it?

775
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,560
Who!,

776
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,760
Qiaonian.

777
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,560
Chen Qiaonian.

778
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,880
Chen Qiaonian.

779
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,680
Shiyan specifically mentioned in the letter,

780
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,360
he said Yannian and Qiaonian were going through

781
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,320
a great fracture in life.

782
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,480
Mr. Zhongfu.

783
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,160
The three of you are finally going to be

784
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,160
a comrade-in-arms in the same trench.

785
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,320
I'm really happy for you guys.

786
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,160
Rise up, hungry and cold slaves.

787
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,520
Rise up, all the world's suffering people.

788
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,480
The blood is boiling,

789
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,960
fighting for the truth.

have also sent representatives to attend.

800

Let's give a big round of applause.

Please welcome their arrival.

802
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,840
Next,

803
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,080
we welcome Comrade Ge Shugui.

804
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,320
Let's introduce Changxindian to us

805
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,800
and the national workers' movement.

806
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,680
Welcome.

807
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,320
Mr. Shouchang, let me say something

808
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Then I will say a few words to you all.

809
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,000
First of all, I want to tell you good news.

810
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
On 1 May of this year,

811
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
we railway workers in Changxindian

812
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,600
held a grand celebration meeting.

813
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,600
The Changxindian Railway Workers Union is formally established.

814
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,200
This is, under the leadership of the Communist Party,

815
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
a party branch of railway workers.

816
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,000
It is an important revolutionary body

817
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,760
for the Party to mobilize and lead the workers' movement.

818
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Now we not only have railway unions,

819
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,360
but we also have the machinists union,

820
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
printers union,

821
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,560
rickshaw pullers union, etc.

822
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,040
With all kinds of industrial trade unions and handicraft trade unions

823
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,440
under the organization and leadership of various trade unions,

824
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,360
the workers' movements in major cities across the country continue to rise.

825
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
The consciousness of the working class is constantly improving.

826
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,720
Now, a number of leading individuals

827
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,480
with communist ideals have emerged.

828
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,600
What does this mean?

829
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,640
This shows that in the Chinese political arena,

830
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,080
we the working class

831
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,720
will play an increasingly important role.

832
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,920
We have become the main force of the revolution.

833
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,960
Comrades,

834
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
I also want to report good news to you.

835
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,760
the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China

836
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
is being held in the south.

837
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,960
The Communist Party of China is formally established!

838
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,360
Hurrah!

839
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,480
This is an epoch-making event!

840
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,840
Hurrah!

841
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,720
Comrades,

842
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,120
the establishment of the Communist Party of China was not accidental.

843
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,600
Since the Opium War,

844
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,880
it is the inevitable outcome of China's historical development.

845
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
It is our Chinese people's

846
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
inevitable product of tenacious exploration

847
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
in the struggle to save the nation from subjugation.

848
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,240
It is our Chinese nation's

849
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
inevitable product of constant awakening

850
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,320
on the road of pursuing rejuvenation.

851
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,760
Comrades,

852
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,920
the birth of the Communist Party of China

853
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,320
means that the Chinese Revolution

854
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,800
will now have a strong leadership core.

855
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,200
This will lay a solid foundation for the inevitable success

856
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,680
for our cause in the future.

857
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,240
Comrades,

858
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
the last line of the "Internationale":

859
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,720
"The Internationale shall be realised!"

860
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,240
This is the highest goal

861
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,880
that we communists pursue

862
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,560
and also the highest stage of human social development.

863
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,600
Comrades, three years ago,

864
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,000
I gave a speech in Central Park.

865
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,800
There was a sentence in it.

866
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,200
The future world

867
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,840
will be a world of red flags.

868
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,000
So today,

869
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,760
I also solemnly tell you

870
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,840
my latest insight.

871
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,280
That is,

872
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,480
only by taking the socialist road

873
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,240
can China realize

874
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,600
the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

875
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,600
And I firmly believe,

876
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,760
one hundred years from now,

877
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,480
China will prove my point today.

878
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,160
Socialism will never fail China!

Against the backdrop of the unprecedented crisis

884

of domestic turmoil and foreign threats facing the Chinese nation,

885
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,680
in combining Marxism-Leninism

886

with the Chinese workers' movement,

887

the Communist Party of China was born.

888
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,240

889
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
This is an epoch-making event.

890

This epoch-making event

891
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,520
has profoundly changed, since modern times,

892
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,880
the direction and course of the development of the Chinese nation.

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,360

and the Chinese nation's future and destiny.

895

The birth of the Communist Party of China

is the inevitable result of the historical choice of modern China.

899
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,320
It is the inevitable result of the choice of the Chinese people.

900
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,520
