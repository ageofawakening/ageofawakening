00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,126
[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:08,126 --> 00:00:11,088
[Episode Forty-three]

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,080
So I hope

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,360
We, Peking University Research Institute of Marxist Theory

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,800
And the upcoming

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,120
Comrades of the Communist Party of China（CPC） Branch

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
Be sure to take an active part in these two big debates.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
The flag clearly shows our attitude.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,480
New youth

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
And the upcoming Communist Party magazine.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,160
Is our position.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,680
good

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,640
Brother, you're visiting abroad.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,400
If it wasn't from Shanghai

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,600
I will try my best to see you off in Beijing.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,040
Sir is in Peking University.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,520
There are two initiatives that have contributed greatly.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,320
reform in education

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,760
Changed the lives of a generation of students

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,280
Concept and virtue

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,840
Promoted the development of the new culture movement.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,240
The second is compatibility and package.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,040
There are various theories in Peking University.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,880
Study as you wish

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,560
It's a bad reputation.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,480
And those who tend to be precious

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
Zeyingye

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,720
admire

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
Zhongfu, you flatter me.

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,040
唐波兄啊

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,160
I should really thank you for all these years.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,560


33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:24,640


34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,200
Thanks brother Botang.

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,280


36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,360


37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:25,520
Thank you, brother Tang

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:25,840
Thanks brother Botang.

39
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,120
All these years have given me so many ideas.

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,160
Ah, people, you really have to thank me

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,800
During your time at Peking University

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
You'll never forget it.

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,920
中富啊

44
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,240
I hear there's another fight between you.

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
What are you crazy about Wu?

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,880
Socialist controversy

47
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,640
You criticized Zhang Dongsun.

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,320
Anarchist controversy

49
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,840
You criticized Huang Lingshuang.

50
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,120
When are you going to

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,800
Criticize me Wu Zhihui and Chen Yannian

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,080
Let me tell you something.

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
I can save you face.

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,960
You followed Russell, and I didn't discover it.

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,760
You encouraged Huang Lingshuang to quit the Communist Party.

56
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,280
I'm not arguing with you either.

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
Because we're not.

58
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,440
A car in a lane.

59
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:09,760
There is no need to quarrel.

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:09,920
Not in a fight

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,480
There is no need to quarrel.

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:10,560


63
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,560
But I have to warn you about one thing.

64
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Don't touch Yannian and Qiaonian again.

65
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
What kind of Tao do they want to choose?

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,680
It is their own choice.

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,440
You have no right to interfere.

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,600
I took an oath long ago.

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
No more shit about your family.

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,880
In a Shanghai saying

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
I don't have a connection with you

72
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,000
Zhongfu, as a brother

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
I have a few words of truth to tell you.

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,240
People often say that different things do not work together.

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,040
You and I have different ways.

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,560
You can also make a plan.

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,280
The new culture movement is you and Shouchang Shizhi.

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
And Mr. Lu Xun.

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
You guys started it.

80
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,720
Now some differences are inevitable.

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,320
But don't let this

82
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
And hurt each other's kindness.

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
Before I came here this time

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,680
Tell Shizhi

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,520
He wants to come to Shanghai and have a good talk with you

86
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
Sir, it's attached

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
Recently, I have planned to

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,240
Shouchang and Shizhi have been invited to Shanghai.

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,400
Great

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,280


91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,360


92
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,520
Shouchang Shizhi

93
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:13,680
Shouchang avenue Shizhi

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,480
Shouchang Shizhi

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:14,560


96
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:14,640


97
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840
I will go to Guangzhou soon.

98
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,200
This time, my family moved south to Guangdong for education.

99
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm afraid I'm going to live there for a while.

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
What worries me is what to do with New Youth.

101
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,040
It's all our children.

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,560
What kind of destination should it be?

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,240
This needs to be decided by everyone.

104
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,200
I have written to you separately for this purpose.

105
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,960
De Yucai et al.

106
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Ask for their opinions.

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,240
I sincerely invite you two to come to Shanghai for an interview.

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
Discuss and solve this problem together.

109
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
Warmly looking forward to you

110
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,200
It is almost as hard for friends to meet as for the morning and evening stars

111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,080
Shouchang Shizhi

112
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,160


113
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,720
ShouchangShizhi

114
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,760
I want to thank you for calling to Shanghai to get together.

115
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,520
It's a worry for me.

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,520
Talents have been hated for thousands of years.

117
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,920
Talents have existed for thousands of years.

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
Zhiwang Gancun Erguotou

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
This is what I said when I first met Shizhi.

120
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,440
Shizhi, remember?

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,320
Of course I remember.

122
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,440
My first day in Beijing

123
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,400
You and Mr. Cai invited me to dinner at the scholar's residence.

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,760
Let's drink Erguotou.

125
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,920
Why, where shall we drink today?

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Jian Shan Ye

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,080
Talk freely about wine

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,280
Come, brother Zhongfu

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
I'd like to congratulate you first.

130
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Honored as Chairman of Education Committee of Guangdong Government.

131
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,120
This is a big official.

132
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
I decided to go to Guangzhou.

133
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,720
Not to be an official.

134
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,080
I want to do something for the backward education in China.

135
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
Just like when we started New Youth.

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,200
Not only for enlightening people's thoughts.

137
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,640
Improve people's quality

138
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,000
You mentioned "New Youth"

139
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,960
I was just going to ask you

140
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,400
Why do we

141
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,840
A good New Youth

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
Has become a publication of a party.

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
Now "New Youth"

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Or was it an academic journal of enlightenment?

145
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,440
Now that we're here.

146
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
Then let's discuss this matter.

147
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,360
Before?

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
I wrote to my colleagues in Beijing for advice.

149
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
They wrote that

150
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,160
All the opinions have been summarized to Shizhi.

151
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,640
Then Shizhi, tell me first.

152
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
I am not satisfied with the present situation of New Youth.

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
Several schemes are put forward for you to choose from.

154
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,000
All the opinions are summarized in Shouchang's place.

155
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
Shouchang, tell me first

156
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,720
good

157
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,840
Since brother Zhongfu is going to work in Guangdong

158
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,720
Shizhi proposed three schemes.

159
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
The first one runs another publication in Beijing.

160
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,560
The second one moved New Youth to Beijing.

161
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,240
But to make a declaration that does not talk about politics.

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,040
The third suspension

163
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,480
These three opinions

164
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
Everyone is unanimously opposed.

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
Everyone finally agreed.

166
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
Since Zhongfu has no time to take care of it

167
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,560
Editor of New Youth

168
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,160
You can move New Youth to Beijing.

169
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,200
But after moving to Beijing, how

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
Everyone's differences are too great to be unified.

171
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,160
Later, most people agreed

172
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,600
Mr. Lu Xun's suggestion

173
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
Put the decision-making power of New Youth

174
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,560
交给中富

175
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
Because "New Youth"

176
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
After all, Zhongfu did it.

177
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,520
Shizhi, am I right to say that?

178
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,640
exactly

179
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,960
But I personally don't agree.

180
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,880
The opinion of this majority

181
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
I also want to ask Zhongfu

182
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,920
You are in Guangdong

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
How can "New Youth" succeed?

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,560
Where to settle down?

185
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
Who will preside over the editor?

186
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
New Youth will stay in Shanghai.

187
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
Chen Wangdao will be the editor.

188
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,240
agree

189
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,040
I have no objection.

190
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
But I am really disappointed.

191
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,760
I am also very sad

192
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Shizhi, today, we talked about wine in Shan Ye.

193
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Speak up if you have anything to say.

194
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,480
I am sad for the split of New Youth.

195
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,240
I am sad for your stubbornness.

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
More sad for your future.

197
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,760
Are we friends?

198
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
I can't convince you, let alone stop you.

199
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,960
I'm out of words now.

200
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,840
I'm only disappointed and sad.

201
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
Shizhi

202
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,000
I invited you and Shouchang to Shanghai today.

203
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
For "New Youth"

204
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
I also want us to exchange ideas together.

205
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
It must be admitted

206
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,600
After the baptism of the May 4th Movement

207
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
Our political attitude towards the country

208
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,760
There was a major disagreement.

209
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,320
Shouchang and I have made it clear

210
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
I chose Marxism.

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,040
Hope to pass.

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
The Road of Russia's October Revolution

213
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
To save China.

214
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Finally, build one

215
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,880
A socialist country where the people are the masters of the country.

216
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
This is my common ideal and pursuit with Shouchang.

217
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Your common ideal and pursuit.

218
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,600
Everyone knows

219
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,280
I was in the red building of Peking University two days ago.

220
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,600
I heard some classmates singing a ballad.

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
Two giants in the red building of Peking University

222
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,480
Spread the dispute between Northern Li and Southern Chen.

223
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
Lonely as a rubber pen.

224
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Double stars shine on ancient and modern times.

225
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,640
But this is their opinion.

226
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,880
And my faith in the two of you

227
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
cannot agree

228
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,280
You say socialism can save the middle pressure.

229
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
Why is Germany, the birthplace of socialism?

230
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,480
Do not engage in socialism

231
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
How many years has the Russian revolution been?

232
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
What makes you conclude that it is suitable for China?

233
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
My opinion is that

234
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
China must copy the American system.

235
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
I studied in America for seven years.

236
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,640
I do it through my own long-term personal experience.

237
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,520
Get the conclusion

238
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,480
What about you? Where did your conclusion come from?

239
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,640
Shizhi, ah

240
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,400
I used to cross the ocean with brother Zhongfu.

241
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
To seek truth.

242
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,480
After so many years of ups and downs

243
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,160
After numerous choices and explorations.

244
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Now we have finally determined a direction.

245
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
Marxism is a scientific truth.

246
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,840
The October Revolution is our example.

247
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,680
The western democracy you worship.

248
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
It doesn't work in China.

249
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,360
Socialism can save the labouring masses.

250
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,880
For this beautiful ideal

251
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
I am willing to give my all.

252
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,680
Shizhi, I believe

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,480
The the Communist Party of China（CPC） we established today.

254
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
It's not just my choice with Shouchang

255
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,840
It is also a historical choice.

256
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,280
I believe there will be more and more Chinese people.

257
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,840
And agree to join this choice.

258
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,800
nicely

259
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm a minority today.

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,200
I won't argue with you.

261
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
I thought since it was a choice.

262
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
Friends should allow people to have their own interests.

263
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
Gentleman is harmonious but different.

264
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,480
The three of us are here today.

265
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,760
Although the faith is different, the friendship is deep.

266
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
Only in this regard

267
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
be even more valuable

268
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,160
A good friendship is precious.

269
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
I agree

270
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
ShizhiShouchang

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,600
The three of us should always be honest with each other.

272
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
As for the choice of faith

273
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,320
Let's leave it to history to judge.

274
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
We got drunk in Shan Ye today.

275
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
Tomorrow will be separated by mountains.

276
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,880
The world is boundless.

277
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,200
Weibei spring tree

278
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,280
Jiangdong Rimuyun

279
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
When do we drink at the table

280
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
Once again, we will discuss our poems carefully

281
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,360
I have been in France for so long.

282
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
Haven't you had a jiaozi yet?

283
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,280
Let you taste my craft today.

284
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,080
good

285
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,440
I can finally eat jiaozi.

286
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,680
Yannian

287
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
This is from Mr. Zhongfu.

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,640
Again and again, I must give it to you myself.

289
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,000
This is the fourth batch.

290
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
It seems that if I don't follow my father

291
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,960
It's impossible for him to give up.

292
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,960
I heard it from Mr. Zhongfu with my own ears.

293
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
QiaonianYannian, if you don't believe in Marxism

294
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,720


295
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,040
Then please go back and tell him

296
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Please rest assured.

297
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Our brothers' beliefs have changed.

298
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,440
changed

299
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,880
Yes, it has changed.

300
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,640
Great

301
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,280
How did you turn around this corner?

302
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,320
It's not easy.

303
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
France has been here for more than a year.

304
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,120
see with one's own eyes

305
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,960
All the experiments failed.

306
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,080
Anarchism can't save the world.

307
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,520
Our belief in it in the past

308
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,840
Can only be said to be built on floating sand.

309
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
Now I read these books.

310
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,600
Ponder over and over

311
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Marxism is science.

312
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,080
We're going to put the blood of this cavity

313
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,480
Dedicated to this beautiful ideal society

314
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,200
Yannian

315
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
Are you sure you want to break with anarchism?

316
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:46,640


317
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:46,720


318
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,280
Definite break

319
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,640
classmates

320
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Today is the representative of our work-study students studying in France.

321
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,600
Mondani Sect and Crusoe Sect

322
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
Sit together for the second time.

323
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Discuss joint action matters.

324
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
The first time is to discuss together.

325
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
Boycott the Beiyang government's borrowing from France.

326
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,320
And the purchase of arms.

327
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,440
Today is to discuss boycotting Lyon Sino-French University.

328
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,600
The problem of rejecting the admission of work-study students

329
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,160
This is a matter for each of our classmates.

330
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
The question of fate and future.

331
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,040
lower place next lower level

332
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
Please Zhao Shiyan introduce the situation to everyone.

333
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,920
classmates

334
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,520
Most of us

335
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
France has been here for more than a year.

336
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,200
But so far.

337
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,800


338
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,920
Almost none of us.

339
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
Be able to enter the school.

340
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,960
January this year

341
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,400
Chinese law education society

342
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,400
Announce decoupling from work-study students

343
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
The French Embassy stopped issuing it. Right

344
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,960
Living expenses of work-study students

345
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,920
the moment

346
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,560
Wu Zhihui, President of Lyon University of China and France

347
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
The degree of work-study students is too low

348
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,640
Can't be excused at one's own expense.

349
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,880
Violation of previous commitments and agreements

350
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,680
Unwilling to accept students studying in France for admission.

351
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
This is for us.

352
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,880
It's like making things worse.

353
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,560
There is only a little hope of going to school.

354
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
Also shamelessly ruined.

355
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,200
classmates

356
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
We can't sit around any longer.

357
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,360
We must act decisively.

358
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,520
Something has to be done.

359
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,400
Qinsheng

360
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,440
Is the news of Wu Zhihui's treachery accurate?

361
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,520
Yannian students can prove my information.

362
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,280
ladies and gentlemen

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This magazine published in Singapore

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,560
Published the general enrollment brochure of Lyon University.

365
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
Clear regulation

366
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,080
If it is not an official fee or there is a real guarantee of payment.

367
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,120
Shall not be included

368
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,520
This domestic letter says

369
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,400
Lyon University has started recruiting students in China.

370
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,880
Take the exam and pay the tuition in full.

371
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,720
According to this admissions brochure

372
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
We work-study students

373
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,320
No one will be admitted.

374
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,160
延年同学

375
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,000
Wu Zhihui has not claimed many times.

376
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,640
Will give priority to Chen Duxiu's two sons.

377
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
Did you enter the University of Lyon?

378
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,680
Runhuan, please rest assured.

379
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,520
Chen Yannian and Chen Qiaonian

380
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
We must advance and retreat together.

381
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,480
If he Wu Zhihui reneges.

382
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,000
We two brothers will fight him to the end.

383
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,040
I propose

384
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,000
All the work-study students rushed to Lyon.

385
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,520
Stationed in Sino-French University

386
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
Don't give up until you reach your goal.

387
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
swear not to stop/rest

388
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,520
Not dogged

389
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,640
Not dogged

390
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,760
Everybody, don't get excited.

391
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,200
Let's not get excited yet.

392
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,160
This question

393
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,480
We should treat it more rationally.

394
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,360
I suggest

395
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
Let's send a student representative first.

396
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,160
Go to Wu Zhihui.

397
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,440
Direct struggle

398
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,200
good

399
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,640
Also, my students are innocent.

400
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,640
Wu Zhihui reneged.

401
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,920
Also, my students are innocent.

402
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,920
Wu Zhihui reneged.

403
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,040
Also, my students are innocent.

404
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Wu Zhihui reneged.

405
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,240
Zhou Enlai

406
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,760
What are you doing here?

407
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,840
That's ridiculous. You guys

408
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,400
Isn't this a riot?

409
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,160
Zhou Enlai

410
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,640
Gather your classmates here.

411
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,920
What do you want to do?

412
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,680
Do you want to force the palace?

413
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,960
Mr. Wu reneged.

414
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,280
Refuse to accept work-study students.

415
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,760
At the same time, you colluded with Chen Zhuan's French authorities.

416
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
Persecute and expel without reason.

417
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,640
Admission of work-study students

418
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,840
the fact proves (that)

419
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,520
You are the cause of the accident.

420
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
You dolls

421
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,760
How can you talk nonsense?

422
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,320
I love you all, Wu Zhihui, but I can't.

423
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,240
How can I lie to you?

424
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,920
We have ample evidence.

425
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,240
Prove that you are good with Chen Zhuan and others.

426
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,080
By means of dividing the department into the lower ones.

427
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
Deprived us of the right to attend school.

428
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,160
You can't deny the evidence.

429
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,920
absolutely ridiculous

430
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,080
You dare to compete with each other, and I am proud and wise.

431
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,400
How dare you slander me Hao Zhihui

432
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,240
For such slanderous words

433
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,600
Absolutely unacceptable.

434
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,680
Yannian Qiaonian

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,920
I treat you as my own.

436
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,920
You can prove my purity.

437
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,880
Will prove it.

438
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,240
Yannian

439
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
Didn't you say you wanted to talk to Mr Wu?

440
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,040
Now is the right time.

441
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,080
Yannian

442
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,000
It's time to end it.

443
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,800
good

444
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,720
Mr. Wu

445
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,520
I am waiting for you at the door with hundreds of work-study students.

446
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,320
today

447
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
You must give us a definite answer.

448
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
Excuse me for a moment.

449
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,320
You two come upstairs with me.

450
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,280
Let's talk here.

451
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,240
I say

452
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,040
You two silly children

453
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,680
How can you hang out with such people?

454
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,720
Mr. Wu Zhihui.

455
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,280
We are here to break with you.

456
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,400
You cheated us.

457
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
Cheated countless people to follow you.

458
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
Students who have traveled thousands of miles to France to work and study.

459
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
I have my own difficulties.

460
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,440
Yannian, you should know

461
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,040
Jingzhongfa University is not a habitat.

462
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,800
It's not the world's greatest shelter.

463
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,640
but

464
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,640
I promise you both.

465
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,120
I will keep my promise to you.

466
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
You should also know me.

467
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,520
We will not give up our belief in being human.

468
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,120
But we can tell you

469
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
We have given up what you taught us.

470
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,080
Belief in anarchism

471
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
So what do you believe in now?

472
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,560
We believe in the beautiful ideal of socialism.

473
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,600
muddled

474
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,640
Mr. Wu Zhihui.

475
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
We will walk the road under our feet.

476
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,360
I won't bother you.

477
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,120
We await your reply.

478
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,000
otherwise

479
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
We will never retreat.

480
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,600
Mr. Wu

481
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
This is my translation of the chorus of Internationale.

482
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
Do you have time to have a look?

483
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
Yannian army Qiaonian

484
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,920
You'll be sorry.

485
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,040
beyond redemption

486
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,840
beyond redemption

487
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,200
beyond redemption

488
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


489
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,520
beyond redemption

490
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,000
beyond redemption

491
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,080
beyond redemption

492
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,040
Marin

493
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,400
howdy

494
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,840
howdy

495
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,560
howdy

496
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,760
Sit, sit

497
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,560
Thank you for waiting.

498
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,360
thank you

499
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,240
thank you

500
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,760
Two representatives

501
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,120
Let me show you something.

502
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,280
This is a letter from Comrade Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao.

503
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
They agreed in the letter.

504
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
Held in Shanghai as soon as possible.

505
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,200
The First National Congress of the Communist Party of China（CPC）

506
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,160
All groups are required to send representatives to attend.

507
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400


508
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,800
Except that the European group can't come because of the long distance.

509
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,000
The remaining seven groups

510
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,080
All the participants have been confirmed.

511
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
We sent the travelling expenses to the delegates.

512
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
One hundred silver dollars per person.

513
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,680
Can Comrade Chen Duxiu and Comrade Ji Dazhao come?

514
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,200
陈独秀志呢

515
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Because of the urgent need to raise funds for universities

516
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,240
Can't attend the meeting

517
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,520
Where is Comrade Li Dazhao?

518
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
Also busy hosting eight universities in Beijing

519
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,040
The problem of teachers' salary.

520
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,320
Can't come to Shanghai.

521
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
South Chen Bei and Li are not present at the meeting.

522
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
Will this still make sense?

523
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,920
Chen Duxiu and Hui Xingran can't attend the meeting.

524
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,040
But the preparation and leadership of the whole conference

525
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,400
He's the host.

526
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
He wrote letters to all the delegates.

527
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
And presented it to the general assembly.

528
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
Four opinions on organization and policy

529
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,640
Bao Huiseng will represent Comrade Chen Duxiu.

530
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,000
Attend this conference.

531
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,200
I want to know.

532
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,760

There are thirteen members of the Communist Party of China.

At present, they have already started one after another.

543
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
Have all their accommodation been arranged?

544
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
Well, we have already arranged this.

545
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,000
We take Peking University

Comrade Li da

551
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,520
Now I'm preparing for the delegates to check in.

552
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,720
Is the meeting also in this place?

553
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
The meeting place should be absolutely safe.

554
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,080
Where does the competition open?

555
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,520
We are still working on it.

556
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,240
But there are alternatives.

557
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,680
So everything is ready?

558
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
It's just the east wind.

559
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,840

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,160
After several conversations with Li Da Li Hanjun

564
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
It is suggested to convene a national congress as soon as possible.

565
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,720
Formally established the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

566
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,360
Da Li Hanjun

567
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,760
通过写陈独秀和李大钊

568
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
Negotiate letters

569
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,440
Decided to open the Communist Party of China（CPC） in Shanghai.

570
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
The first national congress

571
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,960
Jie she Xiong

572
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,400
Shizai

573
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,920
I couldn't pick you up at the dock yesterday.

574
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,840
Know that you are busy

575
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,680
What you are doing now is one thing.

576
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
the creation of heaven and earth―dawn of history

577
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,400
right

578
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,120
The word good can be used properly.

579
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
Is a scholar born in the end?

580
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,520
hit the nail on the head

581
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,600
Jie she Xiong

582
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,120
But this epoch-making event is not easy to do.

583
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,840
These days, I'm in a mess.

584
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,720
The wolf is unbearable.

585
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:26,800


586
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,040
The wolf is unbearable.

587
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,920
Otherwise, I will pick you up at the dock.

588
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,560
Now everyone says

589
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,280
Li Hanjun is the second brother of our party.

590
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,120
This statement deserves its name.

591
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
Master elder brother has no time to show up.

592
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
I have to be reluctant.

593
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,920
Jie she Xiong

594
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,840
But you must help me more.

595
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,680
If this is not done well

596
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,000
Then we'll all be sinners.

597
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,880
Communists are always at the call of the party.

598
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,560
If you have any tasks, you can arrange them.

599
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,760
come

600
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,000
come

601
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,280
This conference

602
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
Discuss the main party program

603
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,480
And future practical work plan.

604
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,680
Everybody discuss.

605
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,840
Please talk to Zhang Guotao and me.

606
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,160
According to the discussion opinions of the three of us

607
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
To draft these two documents.

608
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,440
Jie she Xiong

609
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
You are a scholar of the former Qing Dynasty.

610
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,080
Skill

611
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,880
This matter must belong to you

612
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,280
No problem. You ask for it

613
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
I'll make preparations now.

614
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,360
good

615
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,440
Then I'll prepare the materials for you.

616
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,160
This is the office of Bowen Girls' School

617
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,160
If you think it's noisy here

618
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
Or you can move to my house to write.

619
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,600
It's nice here.

620
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,920
What questions can you discuss with your comrades?

621
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,520
Will the conference be held here?

622
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,720
for security

623
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,520
It's better to hold the conference in my house.

624
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,080
good

625
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,640
Let's talk about thousands.

626
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,600
Seize all the time

627
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,800
nicely

628
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,480
walk up

629
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,560
Is this Mr. Dong Biwu, please?

630
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,160
Yes, I'm Dong Biwu.

631
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,520
You are

632
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,040
Hello, sir.

633
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,120


634
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,200


635
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm Mao Zedong from Hunan.

636
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
Mao Zedong of Xinmin society

637
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,040
be

638
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,560
Runzhi, come on, come on.

639
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,760
Please hold this for me first

640
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,280
good

641
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,800
When I was walking today.

642
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,800
Scraped some peach gum.

643
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,920
Just in time.

644
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
I've heard of frugality, sir.

645
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
I'm watching it today.

646
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,840
Accustomed to frugality

647
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,280
This stick will still work.

648
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
Runzhi has long wanted to see you.

649
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,880
Please sit down.

650
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,600
Please, sir

651
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,280
sir

652
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,640
You are a senior.

653
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,240
And please give me more advice.

654
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,680
Now, I just have a problem.

655
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
I want to ask you for advice.

656
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
I know my husband is drafting it.

657
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,240
Party program and work plan

658
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,400
Is there anything I can do?

659
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,440
You can look forward to it.

660
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,040
Marx said

661
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,520
Is the vanguard of the Communist working class.

662
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,040
You said we were the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

663
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
Does it fit this nature?

664
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,880
I discussed it with some comrades.

665
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
unable to agree/decide which is right

666
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,120
sir

667
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,880
You ask me such a question

668
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
I must have learned something.

669
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,480
This question

670
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,040
We did investigate and study.

671
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
The establishment of the Communist Party of China（CPC）

672
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
Not the dozen of us.

673
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,720
Or more than 50 party members in the country.

674
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,680
The act of meditating in the study.

675
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
It is also Marxism.

676
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,200
The product of the combination with the Chinese labor movement

677
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
For example, in Wuhan.

678
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,960
There are more than 300,000 workers

679
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,720
We investigated last year.

680
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,480
Published in New Youth

681
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,680
The situation of coolies in Hankou

682
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
This is the case.

683
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,320
be

684
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
I have read this investigation report.

685
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,840
Very persuasive

686
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,560
I saw it with my own eyes

687
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,440
Hunger multiplies death quickly.

688
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,640
Yi Wu dong Xia

689
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
Only a broken sack.

690
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,600
Cover the lower body

691
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
This is the present situation of the porters at the Yangtze River wharf.

692
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
They move around every day.

693
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,560
Work overtime every day.

694
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,480
Created high value.

695
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,360
But they themselves are living a miserable life.

696
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,120
Is this their destiny?

697
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
No, absolutely not

698
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
So they are especially equipped with

699
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,800
Revolutionary spirit of resistance

700
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,200
We have only been in Wuhan for three years.

701
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,840
There have been dozens of general strikes.

702
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,800
This fully shows that

703
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,520
The strength and advancement of the Chinese working class

704
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,640
yes

705
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,560
The same is true in Changsha.

706
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,000
the working class

707
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
Are always at the forefront of the struggle.

708
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,080
So I said

709
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,840
Party group in Wuhan

710
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,000
It's definitely not the creation of a few of our scholars.

711
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,120
Fundamentally

712
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,520
Wuhan already has it.

713
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
With Marxism as the guiding ideology

714
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,560
The Class Foundation of Advanced Working Class Organizations

715
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,840
And social conditions.

716
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,040
sir

717
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,800
I totally agree with you.

718
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
The establishment of the Communist Party of China（CPC）

719
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,520
More than just

720
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
The awakening of several of our intellectuals

721
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,000
The first is the awakening of the Chinese working class.

722
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,560
The first is the awakening of the Chinese working class.

723
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,800
It is the awakening of all Chinese people.

724
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,600
Is the great awakening of the Chinese nation.

725
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,680
The Communist Party of China（CPC） represents

726
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,400
The fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people

727
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,080
This is our party.

728
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,880
The rationality and scientificity of today's establishment

729
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,400
More the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

730
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,480
The fundamental driving force for vigorous and indomitable progress.

731
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,520
Great

732
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
This problem is solved.

733
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,840
Runzhi

734
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,080
You and I talked all night.

735
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,960
good

736
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,840
My husband was chosen to study in Moscow.

737
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,240
I have come to report to you on the work of the Socialist Youth League.

738
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,000
The the Communist Party of China（CPC） will be held soon.

739
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,280
The first national congress.

740
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,040
We hope to be able to express our appreciation for the group's work

741
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
Give clearer instructions.

742
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,520
This time in order to make

743
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,520
The first the Communist Party of China（CPC） conference was successfully held.

744
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,280
Me and Comrade Li Dazhao from Beijing.

745
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,720
Have done a lot of preparatory work.

746
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
Including how to strengthen the work of the socialist youth league.

747
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,360
We all responded.

748
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
Bao Huiseng, as my designated representative

749
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,080
I've already set off with Chen Gongbo.

750
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
This time I believe

751
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,600
Great as the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

752
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,880
A sign of formal establishment

753
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,720
It will be a great success.

754
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,160
unfortunately

755
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm also the pre-university principal here.

756
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,160
Need to raise money

757
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,600
I really can't get away.

758
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,000
李大钊同志

759
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
I can't attend the meeting because of Peking University affairs.

760
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,960
This is a great pity.

761
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,560
However, sir, I'm sorry that you can't attend the meeting.

762
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,320
But the Communist Party of China（CPC） was born.

763
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,400
It will be an epoch-making event.

764
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,080
i believe

765
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,440
middle

766
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,760
Aren't you going to attend the preparations?

767
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Is it the job of China Labor Union Secretariat?

768
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,280
How did you get to Guangdong?

769
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
I'm from Shanghai, Mr. Zhongfu.

770
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,400
I brought you two things.

771
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,640
What?

772
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,800
This is Mr. Yi Zisha's visit to Shanghai last month.

773
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,800
I entrusted it to you.

774
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,080
Mr. Yi Zisha went to Beijing alone two days ago.

775
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,800
The assassination of Xu Shichang failed.

776
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,600
Jump into the sea angrily

777
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,520
Suicide

778
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,680
What about the second thing?

779
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,160
This is just sent by Shiyan from France.

780
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,640
Lyrics of Internationale

781
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,880
Do you know the lyrics of these last chorus?

782
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,720
Who translated it?

783
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,560
who

784
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,760
Qiaonian

785
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,560
Chen Qiaonian

786
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,880
Chen Qiaonian

787
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,680
Shiyan specifically mentioned in the letter

788
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,360
Said Yannian and Qiaonian were going through a battle.

789
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,320
The great fission of life

790
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,480
中富先生

791
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,160
The three of you are finally going to be

792
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,160
A comrade-in-arms in the same trench

793
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,320
I'm really happy for you guys.

794
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,800
Slaves who are hungry and cold.

795
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:52,880


796
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,160
Get up hungry and cold slaves.

797
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,520
People who rise up and suffer all over the world

798
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,480
The blood is boiling.

799
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,960
Fight for the truth.

800
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,760
Comrades

801
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,640
Today is the Beijing branch of the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

And the workers' club in Changxindian

805
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,240
Also sent representatives to attend.

806
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,760
Let's give a big round of applause.

807
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,040
Welcome their arrival.

808
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,840
next

809
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,080

Let's introduce Changxin Store to us.

Welcome

813
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,320
Mr. Shouchang, let me say something

814
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Then I'll talk to the big guy.

815
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,000
First of all, I want to tell you a good news.

816
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
On the first floor of May this year.

817
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
We railway workers in Changxindian

818
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,600
Held a grand celebration meeting.

819
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,600
The Changxindian Railway Workers Union was formally established.

820
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,200
This is under the leadership of the Communist Party.

821
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
Organization of railway workers

822
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,000
The party initiated and led the workers' movement.

823
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,760
An important revolutionary body

824
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Now we not only have railway unions.

825
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,360
We also have the Machine Union.

826
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
Printing trade union

827
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,560

Under the organization and leadership of various trade unions

830
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,360
Workers' movements in major cities across the country continue to rise.

831
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
The consciousness of the working class is constantly improving.

832
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,720
Now a batch has emerged.

833
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,480
Advanced elements with communist ideas

834
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,600
What does this mean?

835
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,640
This shows that in the Chinese political arena,

836
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,080
we the working class

837
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,720
will play an increasingly important role.

838
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,920
We have become the main force of the revolution.

839
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,960
Comrades,

840
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
I also want to report good news to you.

841
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,760
the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China

842
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
is being held in the south.

843
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,960
The Communist Party of China is formally established!

844
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,360
Hurrah!

845
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,480
This is an epoch-making event!

846
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,840
Hurrah!

847
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,720
Comrades,

848
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,120
the establishment of the Communist Party of China was not accidental.

849
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,600
Since the Opium War,

850
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,880
it is the inevitable outcome of China's historical development.

851
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
It is our Chinese people's

852
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
inevitable product of tenacious exploration

853
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
in the struggle to save the nation from subjugation.

854
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,240
It is our Chinese nation's

855
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
inevitable product of constant awakening

856
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,320
on the road of pursuing rejuvenation.

857
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,760
Comrades,

858
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,920
the birth of the Communist Party of China

859
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,320
means that the Chinese Revolution

860
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,800
will now have a strong leadership core.

861
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,200
This will lay a solid foundation for the inevitable success

862
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,680
for our cause in the future.

863
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,240
Comrades,

864
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
the last line of the "Internationale":

865
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,720
"The Internationale shall be realised!"

866
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,240
This is the highest goal

867
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,880
that we communists pursue

868
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,560
and also the highest stage of human social development.

869
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,600
Comrades, three years ago,

870
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,000
I gave a speech in Central Park.

871
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,800
There was a sentence in it.

872
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,200
The future world

873
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,840
will be a world of red flags.

874
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,000
So today,

875
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,760
I also solemnly tell you

876
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,840
my latest insight.

877
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,280
That is,

878
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,480
only by taking the socialist road

879
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,240
can China realize

880
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,600
the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

881
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,600
And I firmly believe,

882
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,760
one hundred years from now,

883
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,480
China will prove my point today.

884
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,160
Socialism will never fail China!

885
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:32,240

brought a momumental future."

889

Against the backdrop of the unprecedented crisis

890
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
of domestic turmoil and foreign threats facing the Chinese nation,

891
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,680
in combining Marxism-Leninism

892
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,480
with the Chinese workers' movement,

893
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,640
the Communist Party of China was born.

894
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,240
China gave rise to the Communist Party.

895
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
This is an epoch-making event.

896
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,280
This epoch-making event

897
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,520
has profoundly changed, since modern times,

898
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,880
the direction and course of the development of the Chinese nation.

899
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,360

and the Chinese nation's future and destiny.

901

the trends and patterns of world development.

903

The birth of the Communist Party of China

904

is the inevitable result of the historical choice of modern China.

905
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,320
It is the inevitable result of the choice of the Chinese people.

906
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,520
Since the Communist Party of China came into being,

907
