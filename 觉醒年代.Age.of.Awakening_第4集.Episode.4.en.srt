00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,240
You lend it to me

189
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,440
and just take it out of my salary next month.

190
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:28,029
OK.

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
Xiang Li!

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
Go and get thirty silver dollars.

193
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,800
Alright, alright.

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
Hurry up.

195
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
How's your health?

196
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,040
Same as always, OK.

197
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,221
You caught me off guard.

198
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
You see, the welcome ceremony is being set up for you.

199
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,600
Good.

200
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,320
Here.

201
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,600
Shugui.

202
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Thirty dollars.

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Brother Ge.

204
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,320
As you said, poor people don't have a fragile life.

205
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,160
Save a life, quickly!

206
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
Lao Xie.

207
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,800
You'll also have to lend me ten dollars.

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
I need to get my stuff

209
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,720
back from the pawnshop.

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,160
Hurry up, hurry up and get it.

211
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,280
Good trip. How are you?

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
Come on, big guy.

213
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,560
We warmly welcome

214
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
editor-in-chief Li Dazhao, who has returned from Japan.

215
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,361
Good!

216
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:47,597
Good!

217
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:49,605
Hello.

218
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
Student, take a look and see!

219
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:54,844
[Aurora College, Shanghai]

220
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
This issue of the "New Youth"

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
especially "Youth" by Mr. Li Dazhao

222
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,360
is the most exciting.

223
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,720
Let me read you a paragraph:

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
"To advance civilisation for the world,"

225
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,680
"to create happiness for mankind,"

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,040
"with our youthful selves,"

227
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
"to create a youthful family,"

228
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
"a youthful nation,"

229
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
"a youthful people,"

230
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
"a youthful humanity,"

231
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
"a youthful earth,"

232
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,840
"a youthful universe..."

233
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,920
Sorry about that!

234
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
Who's there?

235
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you see if there's anyone up here?

236
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,080
It's her!

237
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
The one with the accordion at the back!

238
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
That's me.

239
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Did you see anyone down here?

240
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,240
What's going on?

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
It's wet. The magazines are wet.

242
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,880
I was in a hurry to get to class and didn't see them.

243
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
How about this,

244
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
I'll give you ten dollars.

245
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,410
You catch!

246
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,840
What an attitude!

247
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
Who are you shouting at?

248
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,960
What's wrong with me yelling at you?

249
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,920
Get down here!

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,278
Then you wait there.

251
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,760
God there are people like this.

252
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
Brother, I'm all wet.

253
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,280
Who are you shouting at?

254
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
Do you know what you've done wrong?

255
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,960
Whoever you are, you've drenched the magazine

256
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,759
and you haven't even said you're sorry.

257
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,720
I've given you the money.

258
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
I've just made it very clear.

259
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
I was in a hurry to get to class, I didn't see it.

260
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
I was just up there, I couldn't get down.

261
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
What more do you want from me?

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
Do you give money like that?

263
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,280
I don't mean your money.

264
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,560
It's as much as it should be.

265
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,360
Qiaonian, how many copies?

266
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,129
What's your attitude?

267
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,130
What's your attitude?

268
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,280
With a woman like you scattering flowers in the sky

269
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,840
and throwing money away?

270
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Thirteen copies.

271
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:51,573
Thirteen copies.

272
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,640
Twenty-two cents per copy.

273
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,840
How much money?

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,720
Two dollars and eighty-six cents.

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
Add to that the word "Sorry".

276
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
I've given you ten dollars.

277
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
You can pay for all your magazines for ten dollars.

278
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
Ten dollars will get you both a lot of food.

279
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
Who wants to go out for dinner on your dime?

280
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,400
Do you have any manners

281
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,440
and are you reasonable?

282
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
Did your family ever teach you

283
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
the rules?

284
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,480
Rules, huh?

285
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,400
Then I'll give you a good lecture on the rules today.

286
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,360
This is a school.

287
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,560
You have broken a school rule.

288
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,680
The school rule is

289
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
that no one is allowed to set up a stall here.

290
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
You've set up a stall and you're in breach of school rules.

291
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm still really surprised.

292
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,440
Who are you?

293
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,320
What are you doing?

294
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,400
I suddenly remembered that I hadn't met you guys before.

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,680
Sister, how did you get here?

296
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,960
Sister, we are new students.

297
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,080
New students, are you?

298
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
New students are expected to follow the school rules.

299
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
The new students don't study hard,

300
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
they just set up shop and do business here

301
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,880
which will delay their studies.

302
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
How can you live up to the parents who provide for you?

303
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
Who doesn't study well anymore?

304
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
We call this work-study after school.

305
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
French class is a preparatory class for work-study in France.

306
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,560
Then we can work-study in France

307
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,680
but not in our own country.

308
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,720
What's the point?

309
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
Work-study?

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
That's a trendy way of putting it.

311
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,520
There are rules everywhere in China.

312
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,120
School rules are school rules.

313
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
Yes, we are new students

314
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,080
and we don't know the rules.

315
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,040
But now that we know

316
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,760
we can walk

317
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,520
but before that happens, you have to say one word to us.

318
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,720
"Sorry"

319
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
We'll leave as soon as we've finished.

320
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,680
I've grown up

321
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
and never said that word.

322
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,640
Are you leaving?

323
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,520
I'm not leaving.

324
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,560
OK.

325
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
Supervisor!

326
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,640
Sister, don't!

327
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't stop her. Let her shout.

328
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,320
Sister, don't shout.

329
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,853
Shout!

330
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,600
Supervisor!

331
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,240
Sister, don't shout.

332
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,280
We are not like the others.

333
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,040
The "New Youth" magazine is an emancipator of the mind!

334
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:17,933
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

335
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,320
Do you know Mr. Li Dazhao?

336
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,520
I don't know Li Dazhao.

337
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,883
You leaving?

338
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,815
Not leaving.

339
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
OK, hold this for me.

340
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,840
Don't do this.

341
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
Not leaving, are you?

342
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,400
I'll do it.

343
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,760
Sister!

344
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
What are you doing? You want to go insane?

345
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
I didn't ask for trouble.

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,000
The students are watching

347
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,720
while I reasoned with her.

348
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,680
I'm not being a jerk.

349
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,600
Put the magazines down.

350
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
You're a stubborn person.

351
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
There's no reasoning with you!

352
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Why do you have no sense at all?

353
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,480
Sister, don't take our things!

354
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,440
Have a good talk!

355
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
You give me back the magazine!

356
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,720
Sister!

357
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,680
Make way!

358
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
Brother, let's sell it somewhere else.

359
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Don't sell it here.

360
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,720
Alright.

361
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,080
Sell it there and nowhere else.

362
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Here you go.

363
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,880
Thank you.

364
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,040
Grandpa,

365
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
I'll set up a stall here

366
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
to sell "New Youth" magazines.

367
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:20,720
What?

368
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,560
I want a stall here selling magazines,

369
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,600
is it a concern for you?

370
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
Selling books.

371
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
What book?

372
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
"New Youth"

373
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,800
Sell it, sell it.

374
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,080
Thank you!

375
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,880
To love or not to love.

376
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,240
It's not easy to watch them.

377
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
They are the ones who work and study.

378
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,960
Let's all disperse and get on with it.

379
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,240
Close the door.

380
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,120
Take a look and see!

381
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,560
Don't miss it passing by!

382
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,960

385
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,880
Young man, how much is the magazine?

386
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,160
Hello, twenty-two cents a copy.

387
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,600
Come and have a look.

388
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,480
I'll take a look.

389
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,960
Yes, I'll take one.

390
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,920

That's it. Thank you.

Have a good read. Qianian, receipt!

393
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:15,947

395
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,600

408
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,120
Brother, I've got one here too.

409
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,120
Don't mess it up.

410
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
"New Youth"!

411
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
See Mr. Li Dazhao's "Youth"!

412
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,640
This is a well written paragraph.

413
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,960
Stop, stop, stop.

414
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
See Mr. Li Dazhao's "Youth"!

415
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,840

416
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,480
Young man.

417
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,160
Let me ask you something.

418
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,520
Do you have

419
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
the newly reissued issue

420
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,520
of the magazine that published

421
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,080
Li Dazhao's "Youth"?

422
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,960
We have, we have.

621
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Let me have a look.

622
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,880
Go ahead.

623
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,400
Many people like it. They're buying the magazine

624
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,200
just for that article.

625
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,760
Yes. That's the one.

626
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,280
The Master had me looking for it for several days.

627
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Finally found it.

628
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
I'll buy two issues.

629
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
Two?

630
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,600
How much?

631
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,160
Here you go.

632
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,200
Forty-four cents all together.

633
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Twenty-two cents each.

634
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,200
Alright.

635
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,320
This one is new. Take it.

636
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,360
Here.

637
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,360
No problem. It's ok if you don't buy it.

638
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,000
You can read it first.

639
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,960
You can't stop here. Move along.

640
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,480
Right away.

641
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Mister, we have to go.

642
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,880
Coming!

643
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,760
Here's your change.

644
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,400
Here.

645
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,200
Thank you!

646
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,920
Take care.

647
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
Alrighty.

648
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
Alright, here you go.

649
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,800
Qiaonian,

650
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,600
are you keeping track?

651
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,720
That's another two issues.

652
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes.

653
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,240
I've got a few too.

654
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,316
[Baishun Lane, Qianmenwei Street, Beijing]

655
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,440
Brothers,

656
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,560
Let's not go to second-rate tea rooms.

657
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,760
And let's not go to third-rate lodgings.

658
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,880
But rather to this first-rate sing-song house!

659
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
Lan Xiang Ban!

660
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,520
Gui Jin Luan!

661
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,400
Young Masters, be quiet.

662
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,200
Your brother is here!

663
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,840
Young Masters.

664
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,120
Master Zhang, to tell you the truth,

665
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,360
right now, Gui Jin Luan

666
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
is entertaining Master Hu from your Peking University.

667
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,720
The music is coming from her room.

668
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
Master Hu?

669
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,960
Which Master Hu?

670
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,040
The Master Hu from Peking University, Hu Jun.

671
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,440
That's right.

672
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,040
He's been here for several days.

673
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,560
Hu Jun?

674
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,640
I know him!

675
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
He got a professorship due to his relative Duan Qirui.

676
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
Taking money and not teaching properly.

677
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,960
Spending all day eating, drinking, and gambling,

678
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,320
his reputation stinks to high heaven.

679
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,320
Since he's been here for a few days,

680
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,080
then ask him to take a break.

681
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,240
Let's give him a hand.

682
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
Besides, as a teacher,

683
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,320
he ought to defer to students.

684
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,160
Get out of the way.

685
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:30,000
Master Zhang, Master Zhang!

686
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,200
What are you doing just standing there?

687
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,320
Hurry up and call the police!

688
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,040
Master Zhang!

689
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
Stop fighting!

690
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,400
Help!

691
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,166
[Shanghai]

692
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
There's a purse here.

693
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,000
Where did you find it?

694
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,040
Inside the book.

695
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
Do you have any recollection

696
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
of anyone who was here with that purse?

697
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Can't remember.

698
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
Five hundred and eighty-three silver dollars.

699
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,160
So much money.

700
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,040
Five eighty-three!

701
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,600
Quiet!

702
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,040
Let me count it.

703
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,200
Song Ah Di.

704
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
There's no address. Only a name.

705
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
If no one claims it, then we've hit the jackpot.

706
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,720
Hit what jackpot?

707
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
If you had lost this money, wouldn't you be worried?

708
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
Then how do we give it back?

709
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,520
Let's wait.

710
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,600
See if anyone comes to claim it.

711
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,760
Clean up.

712
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
Not going home?

713
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,920
We'll be going right away.

714
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
It's getting dark.

715
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,320
Should get going.

716
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,280
Take care.

717
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,640
See you tomorrow.

718
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,880
Friends, friends.

719
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,440
Have a drink. No, no.

720
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
Why not?

721
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,320
Just sit there, then.

722
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Brother.

723
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,820
Hungry.

724
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,480
Bear with it.

725
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,600
What if I'm still hungry?

726
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,200
Are you hungry?

727
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
I...

728
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,320
I'm also hungry.

729
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Then how do you bear your hunger?

730
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,200
With all my might.

731
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,800
Little mister.

732
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
Aren't you the uncle who bought that magazine.

733
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,360
Yes, yes.

734
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,200
Little misters, have you seen my purse?

735
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,560
First of all, calm down.

736
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,920
What does your purse look like?

737
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
It's brown.

738
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
And filled with the Master's silver certificates.

739
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,360
You can stop looking.

740
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,960
Is this your purse?

741
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,760
That's exactly it.

742
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,280
I can't just give it to you.

743
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,560
I have to ask you a few questions.

744
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,320
Sure, as you should.

745
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,080
Go ahead and ask.

746
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,200
What do you have

747
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,240
inside this purse?

748
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,280
Six silver certificates.

749
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,120
Five hundred and eighty-three silver dollars all together.

750
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
It's a divident from the soap factory.

751
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,240
Only silver certificates?

752
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,360
Are there any silver coins?

753
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
Only certificates, no coins.

754
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,040
Is there anything else besides that?

755
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,240
There is also a bill

756
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,520
with my name on it.

757
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
My name is Song Ah Di.

758
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,920
What you've said all matches up. You can count it.

759
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's all here.

760
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,160
Thank heavens.

761
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
My master's money has finally been found.

762
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,880
Thank you both.

763
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,600
Mister,

764
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,400
you don't need to be like this.

765
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,680
Thank you both young gentlemen.

766
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
You've really saved this old man's life.

767
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,760
I had thought that

768
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,360
if I couldn't find this money

769
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,280
I'd have to jump in the Huangpu river.

770
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,000
Don't be like this.

771
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
It's good enough that you got it back.

772
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,480
You're welcome.

773
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,080
Why don't you put it away,

774
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,040
and get back home quickly.

775
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
Young gentlemen,

776
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,120
please go with me to see my master.

777
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,560
He will definitely reward you.

778
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,360
No, no.

779
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,120
It's nothing. There's no need for a reward.

780
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,320
You should go back home.

781
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,600
We have to go back to the school.

782
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,560
But, but.

783
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,680
Young gentlemen,

784
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,960
let's see this to the end.

785
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,120
Look, it's already dark.

786
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,840
It's not safe for an old man

787
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,280
to be carrying so much money.

788
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Would you two please escort me home?

789
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
Brother, let's see the uncle home.

790
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,400
Let's go.

791
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,160
Don't worry. Let me give you a hand.

792
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,040
This way.

793
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,280

795
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,520

796

We're almost there.

798

Let us help.

799
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,880
No need.

800
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,280
Uncle Song.

801
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,800
You've got your own work.

802
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,480
Here.

803
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,640
We're here.

804
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,000
Please come in.

805
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,360
Here, young gentlemen.

806
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
Please.

807
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
Right this way.

808
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,720
Uncle, now that the money has been safely delivered,

809
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,920
we should be on our way.

810
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,200
Not at all.

811
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
Now that you're already here,

812
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,120
I would like to ask you two to help me testify.

813
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,200
Without you present, I can't explain it properly.

814
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,120
Master will say I'm lying.

815
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,240
Alright.

816
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
Here, put it down.

817
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,920
You put it down too.

818
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,040
Here, take a seat.

819
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,400
A seat here. Alright.

820
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,680
Bring out the coffee.

821
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
Young gentlemen, please wait.

822
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,040
I will find the Master.

823
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,640
Please, sit.

824
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
Master!

825
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,480
Please, the coffee.

826
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,360
Thank you.

827
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,400
I'm hungry.

828
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,400
Bear it.

829
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
I know.

830
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,320
Why are you two here?

831
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,560
Why are you here?

832
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,560
What do you mean, why?

833
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,080
This is my home.

834
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,360
What are you two doing here?

835
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,120
This is your home?

836
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,440
Mother, these are the two scoundrels from today

837
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,480
I was telling you about.

838
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,760
Who's the scoundrel?

839
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,280
Can't you tell the truth for once?

840
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
Who spilled the water all over us today?

841
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
I did spill the water. Didn't I give you money?

842
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,040
Is that the way to give us money?

843
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,240
Then how should I have done it?

844
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,920
Fellow student, you have still not understood

845
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,680
how you are wrong, have you?

846
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,800
Who has wronged whom?

847
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,880
Setting up stalls without permission is in violation of school rules.

848
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,640
You've brought your wares here.

849
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,960
Were you going to set up a street stall in my home?

850
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,560
Set it up then.

851
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Child, don't speak this way.

852
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,680
This way, Master.

853
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,320
Master, these are the two young gentlemen.

854
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,680
This is our Master.

855
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,440
How do you do?

856
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,600
How should address the two of you?

857
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,960
I am Chen Qiaonian.

858
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,480
Chen Yannian.

859
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,880
Thank you both.

860
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Thank you. You're welcome.

861
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,320
Dad, why are you thanking them?

862
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,280
These are the two

863
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,960
who were arguing with me at school.

864
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,960
They were setting up a stall to sell things.

865
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,320
I kicked them out.

866
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
Sister, didn't we already explain to you

867
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
that our stall is a work-study program.

868
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,160
You've already violated the school rules.

869
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,760
What work can you do? What student can you be?

870
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,040
Liu Mei!

871
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,560
These are our guests!

872
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,640
How can you speak to guests in such a way?

873
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
How rude!

874
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,480
Please have a seat.

875
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,720
Alright.

876
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,800
Sit, sit!

877
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,760
Old Song has told me everything.

878
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,040
The two of you, by not pocketing the money,

879
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
have really helped our family.

880
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,680
I must thank you properly.

881
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
Old Song.

882
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,240
Master.

883
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,280
This small gift is a token of my regard.

884
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,560
Please take it.

885
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
We can't take the money.

886
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
We did what we ought to do.

887
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,280
If we really wanted money,

888
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,280
couldn't we have gotten more with the five hundred?

889
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,760
Now that the money has been safely returned,

890
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,360
we are going to go now.

891
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,920
Uncle, we will take our leave.

892
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,360
Wait, don't go.

893
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,600
The both of you,

894
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,720
stay, stay.

895
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
I've heard you say

896
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,160
that you are doing a work-study program.

897
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Then you must have some financial difficulties.

898
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,040
If you insist on refusing this money,

899
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,320
why don't we do this. I am the administrator at the school.

900
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,320
I can waive all of your

901
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,120
tuition and miscellaneous fees.

902
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
It's a matter of course to pay for tuition if attending school.

903
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,000
We pay what should be paid.

904
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,760
We'll figure it out ourselves.

905
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,360
Thank you for your kindness.

906
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,800

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,960

909
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,080
I'm starving.

What are you doing here?

913
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,400
Old Wu, do you know these two?

914
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,560
Far more than know!

915
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,320
These two are Chen Duxiu's sons.

916
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,080
Chen Yannian. Chen Qiaonian.

917
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,800
So they are Chen Duxiu's young masters!

918
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,880
No wonder.

919

920
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,160
he is his own person, and we are us.

921
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
We don't have anything to do with him.

922
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,440
We're going back to school now.

923
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,360
Any later and the school gate will be closed.

929
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,680
How did they end up here with you?

844
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
