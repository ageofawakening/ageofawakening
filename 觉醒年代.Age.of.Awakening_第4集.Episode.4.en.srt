00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,240
You lend it to me

189
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,440
and just take it out of my salary next month.

190
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:28,029
OK.

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
Xiang Li!

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
Go and get thirty silver dollars.

193
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,800
Alright, alright.

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
Hurry up.

195
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
How's your health?

196
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,040
Same as always, OK.

197
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,221
You caught me off guard.

198
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
You see, the welcome ceremony is being set up for you.

199
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,600
Good.

200
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,320
Here.

201
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,600
Shugui.

202
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Thirty dollars.

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Brother Ge.

204
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,320
As you said, poor people don't have a fragile life.

205
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,160
Save a life, quickly!

206
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
Lao Xie.

207
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,800
You'll also have to lend me ten dollars.

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
I need to get my stuff

209
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,720
back from the pawnshop.

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,160
Hurry up, hurry up and get it.

211
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,280
Good trip. How are you?

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
Come on, big guy.

213
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,560
We warmly welcome

214
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
editor-in-chief Li Dazhao, who has returned from Japan.

215
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,361
Good!

216
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:47,597
Good!

217
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:49,605
Hello.

218
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
Student, take a look and see!

219
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:54,844
[Aurora College, Shanghai]

220
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
This issue of the "New Youth"

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
especially "Youth" by Mr. Li Dazhao

222
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,360
is the most exciting.

223
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,720
Let me read you a paragraph:

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
"To advance civilisation for the world,"

225
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,680
"to create happiness for mankind,"

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,040
"with our youthful selves,"

227
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
"to create a youthful family,"

228
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
"a youthful nation,"

229
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
"a youthful people,"

230
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
"a youthful humanity,"

231
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
"a youthful earth,"

232
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,840
"a youthful universe..."

233
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,920
Sorry about that!

234
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
Who's there?

235
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you see if there's anyone up here?

236
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,080
It's her!

237
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
The one with the accordion at the back!

238
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
That's me.

239
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Did you see anyone down here?

240
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,240
What's going on?

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
It's wet. The magazines are wet.

242
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,880
I was in a hurry to get to class and didn't see them.

243
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
How about this,

244
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
I'll give you ten dollars.

245
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,410
You catch!

246
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,840
What an attitude!

247
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
Who are you shouting at?

248
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,960
What's wrong with me yelling at you?

249
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,920
Get down here!

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,278
Then you wait there.

251
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,760
God there are people like this.

252
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
Brother, I'm all wet.

253
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,280
Who are you shouting at?

254
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
Do you know what you've done wrong?

255
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,960
Whoever you are, you've drenched the magazine

256
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,759
and you haven't even said you're sorry.

257
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,720
I've given you the money.

258
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
I've just made it very clear.

259
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
I was in a hurry to get to class, I didn't see it.

260
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
I was just up there, I couldn't get down.

261
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
What more do you want from me?

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
Do you give money like that?

263
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,280
I don't mean your money.

264
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,560
It's as much as it should be.

265
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,360
Qiaonian, how many copies?

266
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,129
What's your attitude?

267
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,130
What's your attitude?

268
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,280
With a woman like you scattering flowers in the sky

269
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,840
and throwing money away?

270
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Thirteen copies.

271
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:51,573
Thirteen copies.

272
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,640
Twenty-two cents per copy.

273
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,840
How much money?

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,720
Two dollars and eighty-six cents.

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
Add to that the word "Sorry".

276
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
I've given you ten dollars.

277
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
You can pay for all your magazines for ten dollars.

278
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
Ten dollars will get you both a lot of food.

279
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
Who wants to go out for dinner on your dime?

280
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,400
Do you have any manners

281
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,440
and are you reasonable?

282
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
Did your family ever teach you

283
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
the rules?

284
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,480
Rules, huh?

285
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,400
Then I'll give you a good lecture on the rules today.

286
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,360
This is a school.

287
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,560
You have broken a school rule.

288
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,680
The school rule is

289
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
that no one is allowed to set up a stall here.

290
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
You've set up a stall and you're in breach of school rules.

291
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm still really surprised.

292
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,440
Who are you?

293
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,320
What are you doing?

294
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,400
I suddenly remembered that I hadn't met you guys before.

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,680
Sister, how did you get here?

296
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,960
Sister, we are new students.

297
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,080
New students, are you?

298
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
New students are expected to follow the school rules.

299
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
The new students don't study hard,

300
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
they just set up shop and do business here

301
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,880
which will delay their studies.

302
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
How can you live up to the parents who provide for you?

303
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
Who doesn't study well anymore?

304
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
We call this work-study after school.

305
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
French class is a preparatory class for work-study in France.

306
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,560
Then we can work-study in France

307
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,680
but not in our own country.

308
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,720
What's the point?

309
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
Work-study?

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
That's a trendy way of putting it.

311
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,520
There are rules everywhere in China.

312
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,120
School rules are school rules.

313
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
Yes, we are new students

314
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,080
and we don't know the rules.

315
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,040
But now that we know

316
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,760
we can walk

317
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,520
but before that happens, you have to say one word to us.

318
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,720
"Sorry"

319
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
We'll leave as soon as we've finished.

320
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,680
I've grown up

321
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
and never said that word.

322
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,640
Are you leaving?

323
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,520
I'm not leaving.

324
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,560
OK.

325
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
Supervisor!

326
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,640
Sister, don't!

327
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't stop her. Let her shout.

328
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,320
Sister, don't shout.

329
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,853
Shout!

330
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,600
Supervisor!

331
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,240
Sister, don't shout.

332
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,280
We are not like the others.

333
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,040
The "New Youth" magazine is an emancipator of the mind!

334
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:17,933
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

335
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,320
Do you know Mr. Li Dazhao?

336
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,520
I don't know Li Dazhao.

337
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,883
You leaving?

338
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,815
Not leaving.

339
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
OK, hold this for me.

340
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,840
Don't do this.

341
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
Not leaving, are you?

342
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,400
I'll do it.

343
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,760
Sister!

344
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
What are you doing? You want to go insane?

345
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
I didn't ask for trouble.

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,000
The students are watching

347
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,720
while I reasoned with her.

348
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,680
I'm not being a jerk.

349
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,600
Put the magazines down.

350
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
You're a stubborn person.

351
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
There's no reasoning with you!

352
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Why do you have no sense at all?

353
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,480
Sister, don't take our things!

354
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,440
Have a good talk!

355
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
You give me back the magazine!

356
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,720
Sister!

357
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,680
Make way!

358
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
Brother, let's sell it somewhere else.

359
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Don't sell it here.

360
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,720
Alright.

361
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,080
Sell it there and nowhere else.

362
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Here you go.

363
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,880
Thank you.

364
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,040
Grandpa,

365
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
I'll set up a stall here

366
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
to sell "New Youth" magazines.

367
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:20,720
What?

368
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,560
I want a stall here selling magazines,

369
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,600
is it a concern for you?

370
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
Selling books.

371
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
What book?

372
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
"New Youth"

373
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,800
