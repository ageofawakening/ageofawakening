I have a friend who has a family emergency.

189
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,240
You lend it to me

190
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,440
and just take it out of my salary next month.

191
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:28,029
OK.

192
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
Xiang Li!

193
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
Go and get thirty silver dollars.

194
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,800
Alright, alright.

195
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
Hurry up.

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
How's your health?

197
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,040
Same as always, OK.

198
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,221
You caught me off guard.

199
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
You see, the welcome ceremony is being set up for you.

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,600
Good.

201
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,320
Here.

202
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,600
Shugui.

203
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Thirty dollars.

204
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Brother Ge.

205
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,320
As you said, poor people don't have a fragile life.

206
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,160
Save a life, quickly!

207
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
Lao Xie.

208
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,800
You'll also have to lend me ten dollars.

209
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
I need to get my stuff

210
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,720
back from the pawnshop.

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,160
Hurry up, hurry up and get it.

212
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,280
Good trip. How are you?

213
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
Come on, big guy.

214
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,560
We warmly welcome

215
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
editor-in-chief Li Dazhao, who has returned from Japan.

216
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,361
Good!

217
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:47,597
Good!

218
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:49,605
Hello.

219
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
Student, take a look and see!

220
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:54,844
[Aurora College, Shanghai]

221
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
This issue of the "New Youth"

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
especially "Youth" by Mr. Li Dazhao

223
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,360
is the most exciting.

224
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,720
Let me read you a paragraph:

225
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
"To advance civilisation for the world,"

226
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,680
"to create happiness for mankind,"

227
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,040
"with our youthful selves,"

228
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
"to create a youthful family,"

229
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
"a youthful nation,"

230
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
"a youthful people,"

231
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
"a youthful humanity,"

232
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
"a youthful earth,"

233
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,840
"a youthful universe..."

234
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,920
Sorry about that!

235
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
Who's there?

236
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you see if there's anyone up here?

237
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,080
It's her!

238
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
The one with the accordion at the back!

239
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
That's me.

240
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Did you see anyone down here?

241
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,240
What's going on?

242
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
It's wet. The magazines are wet.

243
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,880
I was in a hurry to get to class and didn't see them.

244
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
How about this,

245
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
I'll give you ten dollars.

246
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,410
You catch!

247
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,840
What an attitude!

248
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
Who are you shouting at?

249
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,960
What's wrong with me yelling at you?

250
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,920
Get down here!

251
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,278
Then you wait there.

252
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,760
God there are people like this.

253
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
Brother, I'm all wet.

254
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,280
Who are you shouting at?

255
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
Do you know what you've done wrong?

256
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,960
Whoever you are, you've drenched the magazine

257
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,759
and you haven't even said you're sorry.

258
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,720
I've given you the money.

259
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
I've just made it very clear.

260
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
I was in a hurry to get to class, I didn't see it.

261
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
I was just up there, I couldn't get down.

262
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
What more do you want from me?

263
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
Do you give money like that?

264
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,280
I don't mean your money.

265
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,560
It's as much as it should be.

266
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,360
Qiaonian, how many copies?

267
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,129
What's your attitude?

268
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,130
What's your attitude?

269
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,280
With a woman like you scattering flowers in the sky

270
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,840
and throwing money away?

271
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Thirteen copies.

272
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:51,573
Thirteen copies.

273
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,640
Twenty-two cents per copy.

274
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,840
How much money?

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,720
Two dollars and eighty-six cents.

276
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
Add to that the word "Sorry".

277
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
I've given you ten dollars.

278
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
You can pay for all your magazines for ten dollars.

279
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
Ten dollars will get you both a lot of food.

280
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
Who wants to go out for dinner on your dime?

281
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,400
Do you have any manners

282
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,440
and are you reasonable?

283
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
Did your family ever teach you

284
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
the rules?

285
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,480
Rules, huh?

286
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,400
Then I'll give you a good lecture on the rules today.

287
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,360
This is a school.

288
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,560
You have broken a school rule.

289
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,680
The school rule is

290
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
that no one is allowed to set up a stall here.

291
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
You've set up a stall and you're in breach of school rules.

292
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm still really surprised.

293
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,440
Who are you?

294
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,320
What are you doing?

295
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,400
I suddenly remembered that I hadn't met you guys before.

296
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,680
Sister, how did you get here?

297
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,960
Sister, we are new students.

298
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,080
New students, are you?

299
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
New students are expected to follow the school rules.

300
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
The new students don't study hard,

301
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
they just set up shop and do business here

302
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,880
which will delay their studies.

303
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
How can you live up to the parents who provide for you?

304
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
Who doesn't study well anymore?

305
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
We call this work-study after school.

306
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
French class is a preparatory class for work-study in France.

307
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,560
Then we can work-study in France

308
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,680
but not in our own country.

309
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,720
What's the point?

310
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
Work-study?

311
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
That's a trendy way of putting it.

312
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,520
There are rules everywhere in China.

313
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,120
School rules are school rules.

314
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
Yes, we are new students

315
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,080
and we don't know the rules.

316
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,040
But now that we know

317
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,760
we can walk

318
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,520
but before that happens, you have to say one word to us.

319
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,720
"Sorry"

320
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
We'll leave as soon as we've finished.

321
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,680
I've grown up

322
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
and never said that word.

323
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,640
Are you leaving?

324
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,520
I'm not leaving.

325
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,560
OK.

326
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
Supervisor!

327
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,640
Sister, don't!

328
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't stop her. Let her shout.

329
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,320
Sister, don't shout.

330
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,853
Shout!

331
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,600
Supervisor!

332
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,240
Sister, don't shout.

333
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,280
We are not like the others.

334
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,040
The "New Youth" magazine is an emancipator of the mind!

335
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:17,933
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

336
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,320
Do you know Mr. Li Dazhao?

337
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,520
I don't know Li Dazhao.

338
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,883
You leaving?

339
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,815
Not leaving.

340
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
OK, hold this for me.

341
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,840
Don't do this.

342
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
Not leaving, are you?

343
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,400
I'll do it.

344
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,760
Sister!

345
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
What are you doing? You want to go insane?

346
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
I didn't ask for trouble.

347
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,000
The students are watching

348
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,720
while I reasoned with her.

349
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,680
I'm not being a jerk.

350
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,600
Put the magazines down.

351
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
You're a stubborn person.

352
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
There's no reasoning with you!

353
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Why do you have no sense at all?

354
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,480
Sister, don't take our things!

355
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,440
Have a good talk!

356
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
You give me back the magazine!

357
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,720
Sister!

358
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,680
Make way!

359
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
Brother, let's sell it somewhere else.

360
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Don't sell it here.

361
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,720
Alright.

362
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,080
Sell it there and nowhere else.

363
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Here you go.

364
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,880
Thank you.

365
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,040
Grandpa,

366
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
I'll set up a stall here

367
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
to sell "New Youth" magazines.

368
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:20,720
What?

369
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,560
I want a stall here selling magazines,

370
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,600
is it a concern for you?

371
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
Selling books.

372
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
What book?

373
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
"New Youth"

374
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,800
Sell it, sell it.

375
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,080
Thank you!

376
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,880
To love or not to love.

377
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,240
It's not easy to watch them.

378
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
They are the ones who work and study.

379
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,960
Let's all disperse and get on with it.

380
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,240
Close the door.

381
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,120
Take a look and see!

382
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,560
Don't miss it passing by!

383
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,960

386
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,880
Young man, how much is the magazine?

387
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,160
Hello, twenty-two cents a copy.

388
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,600
Come and have a look.

389
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,480
I'll take a look.

390
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,960
Yes, I'll take one.

391
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,920
Twenty-two cents.

392
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,407
That's it. Thank you.

00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,684
Have a good read. Qianian, receipt!

394
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:15,947
OK.

396
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,600

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,520

Thank you!

409
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,120
Brother, I've got one here too.

410
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,120
Don't mess it up.

411
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
"New Youth"!

412
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
See Mr. Li Dazhao's "Youth"!

413
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,640
This is a well written paragraph.

414
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,960
Stop, stop, stop.

415
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
See Mr. Li Dazhao's "Youth"!

416
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,840
See the newly published "New Youth"!

417
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,480
Young man.

418
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,160
Let me ask you something.

419
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,520
Do you have

420
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
the newly reissued issue

421
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,520
of the magazine that published

422
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,080
Li Dazhao's "Youth"?

423
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,960
Sure thing.

424
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Let me have a look.

425
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,880
Go ahead.

426
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,400
Many people like it. They're buying the magazine

427
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,200
just for that article.

428
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,760
Yes. That's the one.

429
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,280
The Master had me looking for it for several days.

430
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Finally found it.

431
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
I'll buy two issues.

432
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
Two?

433
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,600
How much?

434
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,160
Here you go.

435
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,200
Forty-four cents all together.

436
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Twenty-two cents each.

437
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,200
Alright.

438
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,320
This one is new. Take it.

439
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,360
Here.

440
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,360
No problem. It's ok if you don't buy it.

441
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,000
You can read it first.

442
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,960
You can't stop here. Move along.

443
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,480
Right away.

444
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Mister, we have to go.

445
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,880
Coming!

446
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,760
Here's your change.

447
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,400
Here.

448
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,200
Thank you!

449
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,920
Take care.

450
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
Alrighty.

451
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
Alright, here you go.

452
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,800
Qiaonian,

453
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,600
are you keeping track?

454
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,720
That's another two issues.

455
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes.

456
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,240
I've got a few too.

457
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,316
[Baishun Lane, Qianmenwei Street, Beijing]

458
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,440
Brothers,

459
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,560
Let's not go to second-rate tea rooms.

460
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,760
And let's not go to third-rate lodgings.

461
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,880
But rather to this first-rate sing-song house!

462
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
Lan Xiang Ban!

463
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,520
Gui Jin Luan!

464
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,400
Young Masters, be quiet.

465
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,200
Your brother is here!

466
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,840
Young Masters.

467
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,120
Master Zhang, to tell you the truth,

468
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,360
right now, Gui Jin Luan

469
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
is entertaining Master Hu from your Peking University.

470
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,720
The music is coming from her room.

471
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
Master Hu?

472
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,960
Which Master Hu?

473
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,040
The Master Hu from Peking University, Hu Jun.

474
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,440
That's right.

475
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,040
He's been here for several days.

476
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,560
Hu Jun?

477
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,640
I know him!

478
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
He got a professorship due to his relative Duan Qirui.

479
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
Taking money and not teaching properly.

480
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,960
Spending all day eating, drinking, and gambling,

481
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,320
his reputation stinks to high heaven.

482
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,320
Since he's been here for a few days,

483
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,080
then ask him to take a break.

484
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,240
Let's give him a hand.

485
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
Besides, as a teacher,

486
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,320
he ought to defer to students.

487
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,160
Get out of the way.

488
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:30,000
Master Zhang, Master Zhang!

489
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,200
What are you doing just standing there?

490
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,320
Hurry up and call the police!

491
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,040
Master Zhang!

492
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
Stop fighting!

493
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,400
Help!

494
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,166
[Shanghai]

495
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
There's a purse here.

496
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,000
Where did you find it?

497
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,040
Inside the book.

498
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
Do you have any recollection

499
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
of anyone who was here with that purse?

500
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Can't remember.

501
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
Five hundred and eighty-three silver dollars.

502
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,160
So much money.

503
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,040
Five eighty-three!

504
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,600
Quiet!

505
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,040
Let me count it.

506
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,200
Song Ah Di.

507
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
There's no address. Only a name.

508
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
If no one claims it, then we've hit the jackpot.

509
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,720
Hit what jackpot?

510
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
If you had lost this money, wouldn't you be worried?

511
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
Then how do we give it back?

512
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,520
Let's wait.

513
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,600
See if anyone comes to claim it.

514
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,760
Clean up.

515
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
Not going home?

516
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,920
We'll be going right away.

517
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
It's getting dark.

518
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,320
Should get going.

519
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,280
Take care.

520
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,640
See you tomorrow.

521
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,880
Friends, friends.

522
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,440
Have a drink. No, no.

523
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
Why not?

524
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,320
Just sit there, then.

525
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Brother.

526
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,820
Hungry.

527
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,480
Bear with it.

528
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,600
What if I'm still hungry?

529
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,200
Are you hungry?

530
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
I...

531
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,320
I'm also hungry.

532
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Then how do you bear your hunger?

533
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,200
With all my might.

534
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,800
Little mister.

535
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
Aren't you the uncle who bought that magazine.

536
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,360
Yes, yes.

537
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,200
Little misters, have you seen my purse?

538
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,560
First of all, calm down.

539
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,920
What does your purse look like?

540
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
It's brown.

541
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
And filled with the Master's silver certificates.

542
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,360
You can stop looking.

543
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,960
Is this your purse?

544
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,760
That's exactly it.

545
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,280
I can't just give it to you.

546
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,560
I have to ask you a few questions.

547
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,320
Sure, as you should.

548
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,080
Go ahead and ask.

549
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,200
What do you have

550
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,240
inside this purse?

551
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,280
Six silver certificates.

552
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,120
Five hundred and eighty-three silver dollars all together.

553
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
It's a divident from the soap factory.

554
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,240
Only silver certificates?

555
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,360
Are there any silver coins?

556
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
Only certificates, no coins.

557
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,040
Is there anything else besides that?

558
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,240
There is also a bill

559
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,520
with my name on it.

560
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
My name is Song Ah Di.

561
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,920
What you've said all matches up. You can count it.

562
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's all here.

563
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,160
Thank heavens.

564
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
My master's money has finally been found.

565
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,880
Thank you both.

566
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,600
Mister,

567
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,400
you don't need to be like this.

568
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,680
Thank you both young gentlemen.

569
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
You've really saved this old man's life.

570
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,760
I had thought that

571
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,360
if I couldn't find this money

572
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,280
I'd have to jump in the Huangpu river.

573
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,000
Don't be like this.

574
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
It's good enough that you got it back.

575
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,480
You're welcome.

576
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,080
Why don't you put it away,

577
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,040
and get back home quickly.

578
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
Young gentlemen,

579
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,120
please go with me to see my master.

580
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,560
He will definitely reward you.

581
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,360
No, no.

582
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,120
It's nothing. There's no need for a reward.

583
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,320
You should go back home.

584
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,600
We have to go back to the school.

585
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,560
But, but.

586
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,680
Young gentlemen,

587
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,960
let's see this to the end.

588
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,120
Look, it's already dark.

589
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,840
It's not safe for an old man

590
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,280
to be carrying so much money.

591
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Would you two please escort me home?

592
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
Brother, let's see the uncle home.

593
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,400
Let's go.

594
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,160
Don't worry. Let me give you a hand.

595
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,040
This way.

596
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,280

598
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,520
This way, gentlemen.

599

We're almost there.

601

Let us help.

602
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,880
No need.

603
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,280
Uncle Song.

604
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,800
You've got your own work.

605
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,480
Here.

606
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,640
We're here.

607
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,000
Please come in.

608
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,360
Here, young gentlemen.

609
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
Please.

610
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
Right this way.

611
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,720
Uncle, now that the money has been safely delivered,

612
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,920
we should be on our way.

613
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,200
Not at all.

614
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
Now that you're already here,

615
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,120
I would like to ask you two to help me testify.

616
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,200
Without you present, I can't explain it properly.

617
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,120
Master will say I'm lying.

618
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,240
Alright.

619
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
Here, put it down.

620
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,920
You put it down too.

621
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,040
Here, take a seat.

622
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,400
A seat here. Alright.

623
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,680
Bring out the coffee.

624
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
Young gentlemen, please wait.

625
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,040
I will find the Master.

626
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,640
Please, sit.

627
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
Master!

628
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,480
Please, the coffee.

629
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,360
Thank you.

630
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,400
I'm hungry.

631
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,400
Bear it.

632
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
I know.

633
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,320
Why are you two here?

634
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,560
Why are you here?

635
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,560
What do you mean, why?

636
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,080
This is my home.

637
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,360
What are you two doing here?

638
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,120
This is your home?

639
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,440
Mother, these are the two scoundrels from today

640
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,480
I was telling you about.

641
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,760
Who's the scoundrel?

642
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,280
Can't you tell the truth for once?

643
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
Who spilled the water all over us today?

644
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
I did spill the water. Didn't I give you money?

645
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,040
Is that the way to give us money?

646
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,240
Then how should I have done it?

647
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,920
Fellow student, you have still not understood

648
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,680
how you are wrong, have you?

649
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,800
Who has wronged whom?

650
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,880
Setting up stalls without permission is in violation of school rules.

651
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,640
You've brought your wares here.

652
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,960
Were you going to set up a street stall in my home?

653
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,560
Set it up then.

654
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Child, don't speak this way.

655
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,680
This way, Master.

656
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,320
Master, these are the two young gentlemen.

657
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,680
This is our Master.

658
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,440
How do you do?

659
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,600
How should address the two of you?

660
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,960
I am Chen Qiaonian.

661
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,480
Chen Yannian.

662
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,880
Thank you both.

663
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Thank you. You're welcome.

664
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,320
Dad, why are you thanking them?

665
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,280
These are the two

666
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,960
who were arguing with me at school.

667
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,960
They were setting up a stall to sell things.

668
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,320
I kicked them out.

669
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
Sister, didn't we already explain to you

670
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
that our stall is a work-study program.

671
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,160
You've already violated the school rules.

672
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,760
What work can you do? What student can you be?

673
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,040
Liu Mei!

674
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,560
These are our guests!

675
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,640
How can you speak to guests in such a way?

676
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
How rude!

677
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,480
Please have a seat.

678
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,720
Alright.

679
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,800
Sit, sit!

680
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,760
Old Song has told me everything.

681
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,040
The two of you, by not pocketing the money,

682
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
have really helped our family.

683
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,680
I must thank you properly.

684
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
Old Song.

685
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,240
Master.

686
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,280
This small gift is a token of my regard.

687
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,560
Please take it.

688
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
We can't take the money.

689
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
We did what we ought to do.

690
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,280
If we really wanted money,

691
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,280
couldn't we have gotten more with the five hundred?

692
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,760
Now that the money has been safely returned,

693
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,360
we are going to go now.

694
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,920
Uncle, we will take our leave.

695
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,360
Wait, don't go.

696
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,600
The both of you,

697
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,720
stay, stay.

698
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
I've heard you say

699
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,160
that you are doing a work-study program.

700
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Then you must have some financial difficulties.

701
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,040
If you insist on refusing this money,

702
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,320
why don't we do this. I am the administrator at the school.

703
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,320
I can waive all of your

704
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,120
tuition and miscellaneous fees.

705
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
It's a matter of course to pay for tuition if attending school.

706
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,000
We pay what should be paid.

707
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,760
We'll figure it out ourselves.

708
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,360
Thank you for your kindness.

709
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,800

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,960

712
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,080
I'm starving.

What are you doing here?

716
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,400
Old Wu, do you know these two?

717
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,560
Far more than know!

718
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,320
These two are Chen Duxiu's sons.

719
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,080
Chen Yannian. Chen Qiaonian.

720
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,800
So they are Chen Duxiu's young masters!

721
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,880
No wonder.

722
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,560

723
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,160
he is his own person, and we are us.

724
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
We don't have anything to do with him.

725
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,440
We're going back to school now.

726
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,360
Any later and the school gate will be closed.

732
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,680
How did they end up here with you?

733
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240

It's not weasels, then what is it?

749
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,086
A silly lump.

750
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,203
[Zhao Renlan, wife of Li Dazhao]

751
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,001
Miss. The silly lump has come back.

752
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:26,914
Came back...

753
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
I thought you would only be able to come back at night.

754
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,040
When I look at it, there is nothing wrong.

755
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,040
I changed my to ticket to an early morning one. 

756
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,760
Rented a donkey cart. Getting on there's also no people.

757
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,680
In no time, I was pulled to our house entrance. 

758
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,800
Fast. 

759
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,400
The fire... firewood pile.

760
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,560
Those siberian weasels have been coming to the firewood pile. 

761
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,560
Xinghua, Xinghua's been bitten by them.

762
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
Her, her brother grabs a stick

763
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,200
driving away and hurrying over there

764
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,320
to find weasels

765
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,560
Hurry, come here!

766
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,000
This is your guys' dad!

767
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,000
Don't you guys shout to want to find your dad all the time?

768
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,280
Hurry over, call for "dad".

769
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,960
Dad's back.

770
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,247
Dad's come back. Quickly.

771
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:02,919
Quickly.

772
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,786
Hurry to the front. Quickly go and call dad.

773
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:06,786
Hurry, go!

774
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
Xinghua.

775
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,199
Dad!

776
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,569
You...

777
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:28,639
This child, all day who do you keep shouting at?

778
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,040
Want you dad, want your dad. Go search.

779
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,160
Dad's come, and you...

780
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
You stay in your den.

781
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,120
You quickly!

782
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,560
Stop being stubborn there.

783
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
You, quickly go.

784
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,760
Li Baohua

785
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,160
Are you still wetting your bed right now?

786
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,760
Xinghua, Xinghua, Xinghua!

787
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,040
Enough now, enough now.

788
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,080
Come down, come down.

789
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,840
Don't let your dad hold you.

790
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,280
Dad's tired. Quickly.

791
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,600
Wash your face, wash your face.

792
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Dad's washing his face, is that okay?

793
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,640
Dad's going to wash his hands.

794
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
Then I'll hold you again, is that okay?

795
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,080
Good.

796
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,800
Xinghua, catch a big chaffinch.

797
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,920
Slaughter chicken!

798
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Tonight we're eating chicken!

799
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
Slaughter chicken!

800
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,520
Our... our family can finally eat a reunion meal.

801
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,200
Student Li Baohua.

802
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,360
Come out and catch chicken.

803
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,560
Stop it over there!

804
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
Let me help, miss.

805
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,880
No problem. 

806
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,240
Dad, what is this?

807
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
This is called Junqi (land battle chess).

808
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,960
Dad, why didn't buy me something good to eat?

809
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
Didn't you eat all the big reed flowers, you still want to eat something good?

810
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,680
How much good food are you able to eat?

811
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,560
But this land battle chess, we can play with it for a long time.

812
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,320
Do you guys know?

813
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,920
When dad was in Japan, 

814
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,240
everyone relied on this to relieve boredom.

815
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,600
Baohua, don't think that this land battle chess doesn't look good.

816
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,560
This is what dad personally made for you.

817
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,962
Dad will teach you, okay?

818
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:24,682
Okay

819
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,600
This Junqi

820
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,360
needs to have two people to battle.

821
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,120
What's a victory?

822
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,320
I take this piece,

823
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,240
occupy your military command center.

824
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,600
This is a victory.

825
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,760
You see these pieces on the chessboard,

826
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,320
The biggest piece within these pieces is this one.

827
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,320
General.

828
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,160
The last one is this one, landmine.

829
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,080
Landmine, excluding the military engineer,

830
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,760
is afraid of no one.

831
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,600
Xinghua.

832
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,360
It's burning hot.

833
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,240
Do you understand?

834
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,440
Understand.

835
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:55,920
Come.

836
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,120
I'll teach you how to move.

837
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,240
Dad, drink water.

838
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,480
Thank you, Xinghua!

839
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,680
Dad, what is the biggest move?

840
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,520
Just now, didn't dad tell you?

841
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,240
General.

842
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,400
Dad. Then when can you become the biggest official?

843
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Like this, then we can eat meat every day.

844
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
Who said dad wanted to be an official?

845
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,560
Didn't the village people all say？

846
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,400
Studying is so you can become a big official.

847
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,240
Dad, aren't you this village's

848
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,280
person who reads the most.

849
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,280
For sure, you can be the biggest official.

850
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,440
Dad, after you become a big official,

851
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,880
won't we have money then.

852
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,040
When the time comes, can you buy me fruit candy to eat.

853
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,120
Second girl let me have a lick,

854
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,480
it was especially good.

855
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,400
Come.

856
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,240
Saying it like this,

857
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,000
you guys all want dad to become an official.

858
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,840
Being an official is incredible!

859
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,520
And there's money!

860
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,680
Is being an official is incredible?

861
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,200
Baohua, just now dad taught you land battle chess.

862
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,880
Who do you think is the most incredible in here?

863
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,080
General.

864
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,040
Not right.

865
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,880
General is afraid of the landmine.

866
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,680
Right.

867
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,280
Then, the landmine is the most incredible. 

868
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,360
Then who is the landmine afraid of?

869
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,040
The landmine is afraid of the military engineer.

870
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,640
Oh right!

871
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,240
Then military engineer is the most incredible.

872
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,320
That's not right.

873
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,840
After the military engineer removes the landmine,

874
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,600
it will die with whoever it meets!

875
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,960
What you said is correct.

876
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,480
The military engineer acting alone

877
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,600
is surely the weakest. 

878
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
But the military engineer

879
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,760
can make a lot of incredible weapons.

880
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,360
You guys think about it.

881
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
A pile of military engineers stacked together

882
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,520
can create many, many different kinds

883
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,520
of weapons in one piece.

884
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,240
Then officials, aren't they afraid of them?

885
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:30,214
Afraid.

886
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,920
So although second girl's father is a small town official

887
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,520
but her when her mom and grandmother

888
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,120
grabs a broom, he will run.

889
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,440
Therefore, later dad will become a military engineer.

890
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,280
Xinghua, Baohua.

891
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,760
After you guys grow up

892
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,280
No matter if you become a military engineer or something else.

893
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,600
It is up to you to decide.

894
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,880
But remember,

895
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,680
no matter what we become,

896
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,040
we need to be a strong and disciplined person.

897
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,080
We need to be

898
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,480
a person who never harms ordinary people.

899
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,800
This is a present Dad gives to you.

900
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,760
Thank you, Dad!

901
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
What thank you? Take a look.

902
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,200
Such a beautiful case.

903
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
Case is very beautiful

904
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,160
Recently, a friend 

905
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,640
made me go to Nanjing to be an official.

906
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,400
It is said that it's a lucrative job.

907
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
Income is also pretty high.

908
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,520
But I declined it.

909
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,360
I said the warlords right now

910
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,568
cause damage to the country and suffering to the people,

911
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,000
having the ordinary people deal with their days so bitterly.

912
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,320
When I was returning back from Japan,

913
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,680
I made a malicious oath.

914
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,360
Even if I die,

915
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
I will never follow their bad example.

916
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,800
You won't blame me right?

917
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
I listen to you.

918
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,400
I know you won't do things that will cause harm to the ordinary people.

919
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,440
We can't let other people stab us in the back, right?

920
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Do what you want to do.

921
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,720
Us three mother and children you... You don't need to worry.

922
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,040
In the countryside, we can get through anything.

923
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,040
Then... when you become an official,

924
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,120
what plans do you have?

925
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,160
I plan to go back to Beijing and continue running my magazine.

926
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
Although, I say it doesn't earn as much as an official,

927
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,920
But in any case, our food and clothing, we don't need to worry about.

928
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,480
Moreover, that is what I have always wanted to do.

929
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,000
You go steadily do it.

930
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,240
I'll keep watch of this house.

931
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
It's just that this work

932
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,200
may have dangers.

933
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,480
Running a magazine, isn't it just dealing with some cultural things?

934
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,680
How can there still be danger?

935
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,880
You know my ambitions...

936
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,920
is for sure not only running a magazine.

937
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,840
I know that you are a person who wants to do big things.

938
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,360
Doing the right things.

939
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,520
You dealing with those cultural thing.

940
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
I also can't make sense of what the meaning is.

941
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,920
I am afraid that it will give you an impediment.  

942
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,760
How can it?

943
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,800
With you behind my back,

944
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,560
I won't mention much steadiness.

945
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,480
Beijing is cold in winter,

946
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,720
Take this hand stove

947
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,840
to warm up.

948
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
I made a case for you

949
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,360
Look.

950
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,240
Tie it up this way, and it's nice and warm

951
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,600
and you won't burn your hand.

952
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,040
It's suitable.

953
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:33,214
[Shanghai]

954
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,760
I bang on the small gong.

955
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,760
Peking University is really nonsense.

956
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,720
Quarrelling from jealousy, hitting each other.

957
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,200
Forced to send Cai Yuanpei

958
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,120
to take over Peking University Hall.

959
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,960
The cultured sweep the floor.

960
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
A great country's highest educational institute

961
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,440
has unexpectedly raised such a group of scum.

962
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,440
This country, what hopes does it still have?

963
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,960
Right.

964
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,800
This group of students went as far as to quarrel from jealousy,

965
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,760
striking violently.

966
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,880
What is this? Right!

967
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,640
Exactly.

968
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Too overboard! Exactly!

969
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:15,944
[Beijing]

970
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,440
I... come to you for advice.

971
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
Tell me, what do you think Li Yuanhong is doing?

972
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
He gave three gold medals

973
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,560
to make me hurry to Beijing to take position as Peking University's headmaster.

974
00:39:19,381 --> 00:39:22,341
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jie Min]

975
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,840
What is the reason?

976
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
This President Li Yuanhong

977
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,400
was unbearably mocked by Duan Qirui.

978
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:28,279
[Wang Daxie, styled Bo Tang, diplomat of the Beiyang government]

979
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,120
He wanted to do something practical to court favors

980
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,200
to compete with Duan Qirui.

981
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,840
Fighting doesn't work here, so his communication

982
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,480
coincided with a scandal at Peking University.

983
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,760
This President Li

984
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,720
took the opportunity to remove Duan Qirui's trusted aide,

985
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
Hu Renyuan's, position of headmaster.

986
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,920
Your disciple Fan Yuanlin recommended you,

987
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,400
naturally to obtain popular support.

988
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,880
I know.

989
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,480
The current Peking University,

990
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,320
we can say that it is already rotten to the core.

991
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,000
I just don't want to wade in these muddy waters.

992
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,760
Jiemin says one thing but means another.

993
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,600
Your people are already all in Beijing.

994
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Didn't you just indicate your attitude?

995
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,000
Brother Bo Tang, you know me well.

996
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,920
Frankly saying.

997
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,840
Before going up north,

998
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,400
I specially paid a visit to Mr. Sun Zhongshan.

999
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,040
Mr. Sun said to me that

1000
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,640
he hopes that I can turn around Peking University's atmosphere

1001
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,320
and establish a top ranking school that can rise in the world.

1002
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,320
He also hopes that I 

1003
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,200
cultivate the banner of China's modern education

1004
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,200
and hope that I can soon educate people for the country.

1005
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,280
It's true. Education saves the nation, science saves the nation. 

1006
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,720
Talent saves the nation.

1007
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
This is exactly the ideal I, Cai Yuanpei, pursue.

1008
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Currently, China has many things waiting to be done.

1009
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,000
Starting first with the atmosphere,

1010
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,480
nothing can surpass the rise of Chen Duxiu's

1011
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,760
New Culture Movement.

1012
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,360
The most appealing

1013
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,000
also can't surpass the high rise of Chen Duxiu's

1014
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,080
banners of both democracy and science.

1015
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,320
Spreading democracy and science.

1016
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,400
The root is in education.

1017
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,880
You, Cai Yuanpei.

1018
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,240
If we can use the treasure of Peking University to reform and innovate

1019
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,640
to revive our Chinese nation,

1020
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,720
we will then have a support and hope.

1021
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,640
Brother Bo Tang's words 

1022
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,480
is exactly the aspiration of I, Cai Yuanpei.
