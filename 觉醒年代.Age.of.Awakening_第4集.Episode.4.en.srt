1053
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,680
Grab a stick to drive it away a bit!

1054
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,386
Don't let it bite your younger sister again! (?)

1055
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,143
It's not weasesl!

1056
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:12,286
It's not weasels, then what is it?

1057
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:14,000
A silly lump (?)

1058
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:25,343
[Zhao Renlan, Li Dazhao's wife]

I thought you would only be able to come back at night (?)

1061
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,040
Taking a look is also not a problem. (?)

1062
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,040
I changed my to ticket to an early morning one. 

1063
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,760
Rented a donkey cart. Getting on there's also no people.

1064
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,680
In no time, I was pulled to our house entrance. 

1065
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,800
Fast. 

1066
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,400
The fire-- firewood pile.

1067
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,560
Those siberian weasels have been coming to the firewood pile. 

1068
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,529
Xinghua, Xinghua's been bitten by them.

1069
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,071
Her, her brother grabs a stick

1070
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,200
driving away and hitting over there (?)

1071
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,320
To find weasels

1072
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,560
Hurry, come here

1073
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,000

This child, all day who do you keep shouting at

1083
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,040
Want you dad, want your dad. Go search.

1084

Want you dad, want your dad. Go search.

1085
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,043
Dad's come, and you--

1086
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
You stay at your den (?)

1087
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,120
You quickly

1088
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,560
Stop being stubborn there.

1089
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
You, quickly go.

1090
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,760
Li Baohua

1091
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,520

00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,080


1094
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,160


1095
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,600
Are you still wetting your bed right now?

1096
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,760
Xinghua, Xinghua, Xinghua

1097
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,040
Enough now, enough now.

1098
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,080
Come down, come down.

1099
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,829
Don't let your dad hold you.

1100
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,314
Dad's tired. Quickly.

1101
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,600
Wash your face, wash your face.

1102
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Dad's washing his face, is that okay?

1103
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,640
Dad's going to wash his hands.

1104
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
Then I'll hold you again, is that okay?

1105
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,080
Good.

1106
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,800
Xinghua, catch a big chaffinch.

1107
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,920
Slaughter chicken!

1108
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Tonight we're eating chicken!

1109
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
Slaughter chicken!

1110
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,520
Our-- our family can finally eat a reunion meal.

1111
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,200
Student Li Baohua.

1112
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,360
Come out and catch chicken. (?)

1113
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,680


1114
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,560
Stop it over there!

1115
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
Let me help, miss (?)

1116
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,880
No problem. 

1117
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,240
Dad, what is this?

1118
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
This is called land battle chess.

1119
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,440
Dad, why didn't buy me something good to eat?

1120
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,960
Dad, why didn't buy me something good to eat?

1121
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
Didn't you eat all the big reed flowers, you still want to eat something good?

1122
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,680
How much good food are you able to eat? (?)

1123
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,560
But this land battle chess, we can play with it for a long time.

1124
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,320
Do you guys know?

1125
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,920
When dad was in Japan, 

1126
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,240
everyone relied on this to relieve boredom.

1127
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,600
Baohua, don't think that this land battle chess doesn't look good.

1128
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,240
This is what dad personally made for you.

1129
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,320


1130
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:22,560
This is what dad personally made for you.

1131
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,786
Dad will teach you, okay?

1132
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:24,986
Okay

1133
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,600
 This land battle chess 

1134
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,360
needs to have two people to battle.

1135
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,120
What's a victory?

1136
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,320
I take this piece,

1137
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,680

1138
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:33,760


1139
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,240
occupy your military command center.

1140
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,600
This is a victory.

1141
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,760
You see these pieces on the chessboard,

1142
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,320
The biggest piece within these pieces is this one.

1143
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,320
General.

1144
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,160
The last one is this one, landmine.

1145
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,080
Landmine, excluding the military engineer,

1146
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,760
is afraid of no one. (?)

1147
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,600
Xinghua

1148
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,360
It's burning hot.

1149
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,080
Do you understand?

1150
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,240
Do you understand?

1151
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,440
Understand.

1152
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:55,920
Come.

1153
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,120
I'll teach you how to move.

1154
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,240
Dad, drink water.

1155
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,480
Thank you, Xinghua!

1156
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,680
Dad, which is the biggest move(?)

1157
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,199
Just now, didn't dad tell you?

1158
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,520
General.

1159
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,240
General.

1160
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,120
Dad. Then when can you become the biggest official. (?)

1161
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,400
Dad. Then when can you become the biggest official. (?)

1162
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Like this, then we can eat meat every day.

1163
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,560
Who said dad wanted to be an official?

1164
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:16,800
Who said dad wanted to be an official?

1165
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,320
Didn't the village people all say？

1166
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:18,560


1167
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,400
Studying is so you can become a big official.

1168
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:20,472


1169
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,240
Dad, aren't you this village's

1170
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,280
person who reads the most.

1171
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,280
For sure, you can be the biggest official. (?)

1172
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,440
Dad, after you become a big official,

1173
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,880
won't we have money then.

1174
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,040
When the time comes, can you buy me fruit candy to eat.

1175
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,120
Second girl let me have a lick,

1176
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,480
it was especially good.

1177
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,400
Come.

1178
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,480


1179
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,240
Saying it like this (?)

1180
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,280
you guys all want dad to become an official.

1181
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,000
you guys all want dad to become an official.

1182
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,840
Being an official is incredible!

1183
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,520
And there's money!

1184
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,480


1185
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,280
Is being an official is incredible?

1186
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,680


1187
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,480


1188
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,600
Baohua, just now dad taught you land battle chess.

1189
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Baohua, just now dad taught you land battle chess.

1190
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,080
Baohua, just now dad taught you land battle chess.

1191
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,400
Baohua, just now dad taught you land battle chess.

1192
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,200
Baohua, just now dad taught you land battle chess.

1193
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,880
Who do you think is the most incredible in here?

1194
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:53,360


1195
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,080
General.

1196
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,040
Not right.

1197
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,880
Big general is afraid of the landmine.

1198
00:34:57,043 --> 00:34:57,686
Right.

1199
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,280
Then, the landlmine is the most incredible. 

1200
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:01,680
Then who is the landmine afraid of?

1201
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,040
The landmine is afraid of the military engineer.

1202
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,640
Oh right!

1203
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:06,243
Then military engineer is the most incredible.

1204
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,320
That's not right.

1205
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,840


1206
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,920
After the military engineer removes the landmine,

1207
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,600
it will die with whoever it meets!

1208
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,960
What you said is correct.

1209
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,480
The military engineer acting alone

1210
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,600
is surely the weakest. 

1211
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
But the military engineer

1212
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,760
can make a lot of incredible weapons.

1213
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,360
You guys think about it

1214
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
A pile of military engineers gathered together (?)

1215
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,520
can create all kinds of (?)

1216
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,520
Many weapons (?)

1217
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,014
Then officials, aren't they afraid of them?

1218
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:30,214
Afraid.

1219
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,920
So although second girl's father is a small town official (?)

1220
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,520
but her when her mom and grandmother (?)

1221
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,129
grabs a broom, he will run. (?)

1222
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,440
Therefore, later dad will become a military engineer (?)

1223
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,280
Xinghua, Baohua

1224
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,680


1225
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,760
After you guys grow up

1226
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,280
No matter if you become a military engineer or something else

1227
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,600
It is up to you to pick. (?)

1228
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,880
But remember

1229
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,680
No matter what we become

1230
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,040
we need to be a strong and disciplined person.

1231
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,160
We need to be

1232
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,080
We need to be

1233
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,480
a person who never harms ordinary people. (?)

1234
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,800
This is a present dad gives to you.

1235
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,760
Thank you, dad!

1236
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
What thank you? Take a look.

1237
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,200
Such a beautiful case.

1238
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
Case is very beautiful

1239
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:17,680


1240
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,000


1241
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,000
Recently, a friend 

1242
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,640
made me go to Nanjing to be an official.

1243
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,400
It is said that it's a lucrative job (?)

1244
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
Income is also pretty high.

1245
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,520
But I declined it.

1246
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,960
I said the warlords right now

1247
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,360
cause damage to the country and suffering to the people.

1248
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,280
cause damage to the country and suffering to the people.

1249
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,000
Have the ordinary people deal with their days so bitterly (?)

1250
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,320
When I was returning back from Japan

1251
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,640


1252
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:36,880


1253
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:36,960


1254
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,440
I made a malicious oath (?)

1255
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,680


1256
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,360
Even if I die, (?)

1257
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
I will never follow their bad example (?)

1258
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,800
You won't blame me right?

1259
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
I listen to you (?)

1260
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,400
I know you won't do things that will cause harm to the ordinary people (?)

1261
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,440
We can't let other people stab us in the back, right? (?)

1262
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Do what you want to do. (?)

1263
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,720
Us three mother and children you... You don't need to worry.

1264
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,040
In the countryside, we can get through anything. (?)

1265
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,040
Then... when you become an official

1266
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,120
what plans do you have?

1267
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,160
I plan to go back to Beijing and continue running my magazine.

1268
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
Although, I say it doesn't earn as much as an official, (?)

1269
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,920
But in any case, our food and clothing, we don't need to worry about.

1270
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,480
Moreover, that is what I have always wanted to do.

1271
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,000
You go steadily do it. (?)

1272
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,240
I'll keep watch of this house 

1273
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
It's just that this work

1274
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,200
may have dangers.

1275
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,000


1276
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,480
Running a magazine, isn't it just dealing with some cultural things (?)

1277
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,680
How can there still be danger?

1278
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,880
You know my ambitions...

1279
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,920
is for sure not only running a magazine.

1280
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,840
I know that you are a person who wants to do big things.

1281
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,360
Doing proper things. (?)

1282
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,520
You dealing with those cultural things. (?)

1283
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
I also can't make sense of what the meaning is (?)

1284
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,920
I am afraid that it will give you an impediment.  

1285
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,760
How can it?

1286
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,800
With you behind my back,

1287
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,560
I won't mention much steadiness (?)

1288
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,480
Beijing is cold in winter, (?)

1289
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,720
Take this hand stove

1290
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,680
to warm up.

1291
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,840


1292
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
I made a case for you

1293
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,360
Look.

1294
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,240
Tie it up this way, and it's nice and warm (?)

1295
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,600
and you won't burn your hand.

1296
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,040
It's suitable.

1297
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:33,214
[Shanghai]

1298
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,900
I bang on the small gong

1299
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,786
Peking University is really making a scene (?)

1300
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,720
Quarrelling from jealousy, hitting each other (?)

1301
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,200
Forced to send Cai Yuanpei (?)

1302
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:49,000
To take control of Peking University Hall (?)

1303
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,957
The cultured sweep the floor (?)

1304
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
A great power's highest educational institute

1305
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,440
unexpectedly raised such a group scum (?)

1306
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,440
This country, what hopes does it still have?

1307
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,960
Right.

1308
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,800
This group of students went as far as to quarrel from jealousy (?)

1309
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,880


1310
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,760
Striking violently (?)

1311
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,240
What is this?  Right!

1312
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,880
What is this?  Right!

1313
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,657
Exactly.

1314
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Too overboard!  Exactly!

1315
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:11,114
[Beijing]

1316
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,440
I... come to you for advice.

1317
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
Tell me, what kind of atmosphere did, Li Yuanhong, bring in (?)

1318
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
He joined three gold medals

1319
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,560
[Cai Yuanpei, courtesy name Jiemin]
to make me hurry to Beijing to take position as Peking University's headmaster.

1320
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,840
For what reason (?)

1321
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
This President Li Yuanhong (?)

1322
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,400
[Wang Daxie, courtesy name Botang, official of foreign affairs of Beiyang] was unbearably mocked by Duan Qirui (?)

1323
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,120
He wants to do a little practical courting of favors (?)

1324
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,200
to compete with Duan Qirui

1325
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,840
Fighting doesn't work here, so he communicates (?)

1326
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,480
Properly take the chance upon Peking University to produce a scandal (?)

1327
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,760
This President Li

1328
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,720
took the opportunity to remove Duan Qirui's trusted aide,

1329
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
Hu Renyuan's, position of headmaster (?)

1330
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,920
Your disciple Fan Yuanlin recommended you,

1331
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,400
naturally is to obtain popular support.

1332
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,880
I know.

1333
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,480
The current Peking University

1334
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,320
we can say that it is already rotten to the core.

1335
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,000
I just don't want to wade in these muddy waters (?)

1336
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,760
Jiemin says one thing but means another (?)

1337
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,600
Your people are already all in Beijing.

1338
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Didn't you just indicate your attitude (?) 

1339
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,840
Brother Botang who knows me (?)

1340
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,000
 

1341
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,920
Frankly saying.

1342
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,840
Before going up north,

1343
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,400
I specially paid a visit to Mr. Sun Zhongshan (?)

1344
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,040
Mr. Sun gave me a talk (?)

1345
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:26,643
He hopes that I can turn around Peking University's school atmosphere.

1346
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,320
Establish a top ranking school that can rise in the world (?)

1347
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,320
He also hopes that I 

1348
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,200
cultivate the banner of China's modern education (?)

1349
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,200
Hope that I can, for the country, earlier nurture a capable individual who can be a pillar (?)

1350
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,280
It's true. Education saves the nation, science saves the nation. 

1351
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,720
Talent saves the nation.

1352
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
This is exactly the ideal I, Cai Yuanpei, pursue. (?)

1353
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Presently, China has man things waiting to be done.

1354
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,000
Starting the atmosphere is first (?)

1355
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,480
nothing can surpass the rise of Chen Duxiu's (?)

1356
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,760
New Culture Movement

1357
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,360
the most attractive 

1358
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,000
also can't surpass the high rise of Chen Duxiu's (?)

1359
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,080
banners of both sides of Democracy and Science (?)

1360
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,320
Spreading Democracy and Science

1361
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,400
The root is in education.

1362
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,880
You, Cai Yuanpei

1363
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,240
If you can borrow Peking University, this precious place, to innovatively reform (?)

1364
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,640
revitalize my Chinese people

1365
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,720
then there is support and hope (?)

1366
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,640
Brother Botang's words 

1367
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,480
is exactly my, Cai Yuanpei's, aspiration (?)
