00:00:00,607 --> 00:00:03,596
[Episode Twenty-three]

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,280
Three working groups are struggling to operate.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,400
No customers in the canteen.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,840
The laundry team can't attract guests either.

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
Only one making profits is the filming group, but barely.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,680
We won't be able to last if it keeps like this.

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,120
Not to mention now with this mess.

9
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,040
It overturned the public opinion originally supported us

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,520
Comrades, we can't just sit and wait for the end to come.

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,280
We must find out whoever is behind this.

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,960
I disagree with you.

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,520
I think this article is not a bad thing.

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, there is someone crticizing us.

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
But, that is also free advertising for us.

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,280
We probabaly should thank him.

17
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,640
I agree.

18
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,920
This LiaoZhi guy.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,200
He is promoting us right now.

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,400
Think about it.

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,880
Are we not pursuing the desired freedom now?

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,920
If we are.

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
Then what do we have to fear?

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,400
I disagree

25
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,040
I don't agree either.

26
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,560
It is clearly badmouthing us.

27
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,680
Well, this article is...

28
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
It is a bit too aggressive and biased.

29
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,920
Yannian

30
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Yannian

31
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,320
what's wrong?

32
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,360
Yannian

33
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
I met some strangers at the door just now.

34
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
They asked me about the work-study mutual aid society.

35
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,560
I asked who they were looking for.

36
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,600
They are looking for Yi Qunxian.

37
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,200
I noticed there was a policeman.

38
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,240
I said I didn't know.

39
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
But they'll know it's here soon.

40
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,880
So I locked up the front yard door.

41
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,920
Damn.

42
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,360
My dad must sent them to catch me.

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
I-I don't want to go back.

44
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,000
Please help me.

45
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
We are in capital city, the best city.

46
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,960
They can't take you against your will.

47
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
Who do they think we are?

48
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Don't be afraid, Comrade Qunxian.

49
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,400
We will protect you.

50
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,480
You and He Mengxiong

51
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,320
Take her, jump out of the window in laundry room.

52
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,520
Go to the French Academy.

53
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,120
Other girls go back to the dormitory, cover them.

54
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,800
All men, following me to open the door.

55
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Ok.

56
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,720
Go.

57
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,640
Open the door

58
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,280
open the door

59
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,640
Coming

60
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,600
open the door

61
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,280
What do you want?

62
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
We are entrusted by Congressman Yi kuilong.

63
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,160
Looking for his daughter, Miss Yi Qunxian.

64
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,240
Then why come to us?

65
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,600
We received a report.

66
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
Miss Yi was deceived into joining the work-study mutual aid society.

67
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,080
She lives here.

68
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,120
There is no such person.

69
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,400
We don't know her.

70
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,280
Yes

71
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,560
We don't know her.

72
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,040
You guys got it wrong.

73
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
We are all students from other places.

74
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Didn't see her.

75
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,040
Me neither.

76
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Where is the girls dormitory?

77
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,680
Do you have a search warrant?

78
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,800
This is not a search.

79
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
This is a routine inspection.

80
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Please don't interfere with our official duties.

81
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,360
go

82
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,600
go

83
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
What are you doing? This is girls' dormitory

84
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,960
stop

85
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Where are you going?

86
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,240
pour away the water

87
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
Is it illegal?

88
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,080
All stand up.

89
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
Put your hand down.

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
Sir, no sign of her in the boy's dormitory.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
Report to the police station immediately when you find Yi Qunxian.

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,240
You will be punished if you hide her.

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,680
go

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Xiusong, Qiaonian

95
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,920
See the police off.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,640
good

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,680
How was it?

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,400
Was I doing okay?

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,040
Great job.

100
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
You are the smartest.

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,200
Keep doors and windows closed.

102
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
No thief shall have their way.

103
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,440
wonton

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Freshly made

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
Keep doors and windows closed.

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
Theft prevention and theft prevention

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
wonton

108
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,760
Freshly made

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
Keep doors and windows closed.

110
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Comrade Yi Qunxian

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,440
If you don't mind.

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Of course I don't mind.

113
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,120
Rise

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,640
go

115
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,400
Push harder

116
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,320
go

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,200
Slowly, slowly

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,760
You know someone called "Cairen"?

119
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,720
No idea.

120
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
All right, thanks

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
Excuse me, mind me asking something?

122
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
Do you know a man called "Cairen"?

123
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
Excuse me, do you know Cairen?

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,720
Never heard

125
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,840
I told you that Peking University's law department is too big.

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,520
Finding someone is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you sure that person is from Peking University?

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
Yes.

129
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,640
He interviewed me twice in private.

130
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
But as soon as I mentioned introducing you guys to him

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,480
He wouldn't give me a straight answer.

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
He must be hidding something.

133
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
That is the guy!

134
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,240
Him?

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,520
Are you sure?

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm sure.

137
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,680
This can't be good.

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Wait, you know him?

139
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
Not only know him.

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,760
This man's name is Zhang Fengzai

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
I dealt with him when I was in Japan.

142
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,800
Lin Ye of Retro School is his teacher

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Disciple of Huang Kan

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,800
A typical royalist

145
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
Who cares about whose student he is.

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
I'll go and confront him.

147
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
You are gonna just go like this?

148
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
What if he denies it all?

149
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
We won't know if we don't act now

150
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
Wait a second, we have few problems now.

151
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,440
First, we have no direct evidence

152
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
To prove that he wrote the article.

153
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
Second, the argument between the new culture and the retro school

154
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
It is heating up every second

155
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
We can't risk involving Mr. Shouchang and Mr. Shizhi again

156
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
Also there is Chen Duxiu.

157
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,080
I think there is a bigger picture behind this.

158
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
Yannian makes sense.

159
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,760
He is coming out.

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,720
Hide! Hide!

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,280
hurry up

162
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,920
It's too late.

163
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,720
Play it by ear.

164
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,920
Time to improvise.

165
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Yannian

166
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,480
You-you are Tiren?

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Ah, wait it's Jiren.

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,080
Oh no it's Cairen.

169
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Who are you

170
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,680
Hey

171
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,040
You forgot about us already?

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,400
You just did the interview few days ago.

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Isn't this Miss Yi?

174
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,160
long time no see

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I remember now, Mr garlic clove.

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,400
What is it, you want to talk to me?

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,360
Yes.

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,360
Now answer me.

179
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,200
Did you write this article?

180
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,480
What newspaper?

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
It was not me who wrote it

182
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,760
You didn't write it?

183
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
If it's not you, then who did?

184
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
Since the establishment of our mutual aid society

185
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,720
The only interview we accepted was with you.

186
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,720
And you interviewed her again off the book

187
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,920
Twice secrectly.

188
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760
In this artice, all our members' family background was presented.

189
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,680
With details.

190
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
But everything else was total nonsense

191
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
You claimed you didn't write it, then tell me who did?

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,640
I am warning you, stop bullshiting.

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,440
You take a good look at it.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
Signature for this article is Liaozhi, clearly.

195
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
This won't work.

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,440
What's my name

197
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
My name is Cairen.

198
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
This has nothing to do with me

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Wrong person.

200
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,080
You can't go.

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
What, you wanna fight now?

202
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,560
I won't do it.

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,840
You need to come with me and tell my friends what happened.

204
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,720
Why should I?

205
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,680
You can't go.

206
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,240
What are you doing

207
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,320


208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,120
This is Peking University.

209
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,560
You are gonna get in trouble. Let go.

210
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,680
Wait, come with me.

211
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,160
You!

212
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,200
What are you doing?

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,920
So you wanna fight?

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,280
Wait, where are you going.

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,760
You come back with me and make it clear.

216
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,640
I have nothing to tell.

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,520
I am gonna call for help.

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,600
He Mengxiong

219
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,120
What are you doing now?

220
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,040
Criticizing me in the mutual aid society is not enough,

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,320
Now you harass Mr. Zhang as well?

222
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,760
what proof do you have ？

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,760
Ugh

224
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
What do you mean, Liumei?

225
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
If it weren't for your fault.

226
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
Why are we going through all this trouble?

227
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
What do you mean, I got into trouble first?

228
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,440
About advertising,

229
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,040
didn't I ask everyone's opinion?

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,240
Everyone agreed.

231
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,200
You didn't object either.

232
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,200
So I invited reporter Zhang.

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
You were all been interviewed.

234
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,840
How come when something went wrong,

235
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
It's my fault?

236
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
I am not responsible.

237
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,520
Mr. Zhang, you have no idea.

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,120
When the newspaper came out

239
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
They turned into insane dogs

240
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
A pack of crazy dogs

241
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
They barked at me, threw shit on me.

242
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
No matter how much I suffer and complain,

243
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,720
No one would listen to me.

244
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,760
I'm telling you now

245
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
I am done with this mutual aid club.

246
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,240
Liumei, you are siding with an outsider now

247
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,760
If this is your attitude,

248
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,760
Our mutual aid society will expel you today.

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Whatever

250
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't care anymore.

251
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
Yi Qunxian, let me tell you.

252
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,040
Don't take yourself too seriously cause your father is a congressman.

253
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,760
How about that?

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
I never like you!

255
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
Are you crazy, Liumei!

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
You are like a rat shit.

257
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
A rat shit ruined a whole pot of good porridge!

258
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,760
You call me a rat shit?

259
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
What about you?

260
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,480
Your escape from marriage failed

261
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
Better go home before you lose the chance to marry forever!

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,960
Take a good look at yourself!

263
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,160
So what if I can't get married?

264
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,960
Comrades

265
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,920
Don't argue over me.

266
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,080
To be honest, I do care.

267
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,520
This mutual aid society.

268
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
I especially hope that our mutual aid society

269
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
Like a seed.

270
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
After being moistened by rain and bathed by sunshine

271
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,200
Slowly grow into a towering tree.

272
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,280
I especially hope that our mutual aid society

273
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
Will be able to flourish

274
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
So how could I possibly write this?

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
This kind of lousy article.

276
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,800
No need to explain to them, Mr. Zhang.

277
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,400
The people in their mutual aid society are one track mind.

278
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,880
They are stubborn

279
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,840
They won't listen to people.

280
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm telling you it's dark.

281
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
Really dark business inside.

282
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,760
I could spend three days and three nights talking about it.

283
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
And even that wouldn't be enough.

284
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Let's walk,

285
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,080
We can find a Cafe or a teahouse or something.

286
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,120
I will tell you all.

287
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,120
I want to peel off their disguise layer by layer.

288
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,240
Let's go

289
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,440
You traitor.

290
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
I am gonna bite you to death today

291
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,440
Qunxian

292
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Come back here!

293
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,280
Liumei!

294
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
I will finish you today.

295
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,000
Come back!

296
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
Liu Mei, you're getting out of line.

297
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
So this is Liumei playing it by ear?

298
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,560
Well played

299
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
That really pissed me off.

300
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,360
If he hadn't just stopped me.

301
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,400
I was gonna bite her.

302
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,080
That was convincible enough, right?

303
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,800
No, no.

304
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,280
Wonderful work.

305
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
But Liu Mei is going alone now.

306
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
I am worried that Cairen might set trap again.

307
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
You know him? Chen Yannian?

308
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
He's Chen Duxiu's eldest son.

309
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
He tricked me into the club using sweet words

310
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,400
If we don't take him and his father down

311
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
Expose their behaviors to the world.

312
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,960
Me, Liumei, will die with my eyes wide open

313
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
In that case.

314
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
I can help you.

315
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,640
Really?

316
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
Don't underestimate me.

317
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,760
I will tell you what's going on here

318
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,280
We have been planning something big

319
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,840
Get close.

320
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,440
My second uncle has submitted it to Congress.

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
A proposal on impeaching Cai Yuanpei, Headmaster of Peking University

322
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
Who is your second uncle?

323
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,800
His name is Zhang Changli.

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,960
Prliamentarian

325
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,520
That's the same as Yi Qunxian's father.

326
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,920
Isn't it

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,560
exactly

328
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
And we are working with Yikuilong too

329
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
The proposal is co-signed

330
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
by the group of us

331
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,280
This time, we must take Chen Duxiu and his gang

332
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
Tear up the altar

333
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
Pull Chen Duxiu and them off the altar

334
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
One proposal won't be enough, dont you think?

335
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
Submitting it to the Congress

336
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,400
It's only our first step.

337
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
As for the second step

338
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
We also contacted a number of

339
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,280
domestic and foreign media reporters.

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,840
Look, they are all with us.

341
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,040
A list of journalists.

342
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,240
Enough from me,

343
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
It's your turn to give me some information.

344
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,160
Come on

345
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
Laoshen

346
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,880
These seven articles have similar themes,

347
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,920
written neatly.

348
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,640
Take a look,

349
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
Is it suitable for your column?

350
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,560
Ok

351
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,360
Hurry up and read them through.

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,960
This Chen Zhongfu

353
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,960
Didn't we say it clearly that day?

354
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,640
He's in charge of New Youth.

355
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
But now he is never here.

356
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
So many articles

357
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,920
How can two people finish reading it all?

358
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
Zhongfu is as busy as a bee right now.

359
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
Tons of responsibilities on his shoulder

360
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
His alone.

361
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,840
Just heard that Xinchao office was being attacked

362
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,560
Besieged by people

363
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,840
He hurried to solve it

364
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,240
You two have worked hard

365
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,280
Here we come

366
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,360
We are here

367
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,680
Here we come

368
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
Drop off the manuscript again.

369
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm exhausted, you guys.

370
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
We didn't just come for the manuscript

371
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,080
We came to help as well

372
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,840
Have you finished proofreading?

373
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,400
All done

374
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,880
good

375
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,920
Deqian

376
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,680
This is truly assistance arrived just in time.

377
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,480
Please

378
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,360
Thank you!

379
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,560
Well, we have food of spirit now,

380
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
Material food should also be available.

381
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
So let's hurry.

382
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,640
Got you some hot food

383
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,440
How many manuscripts have you received?

384
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,120
Not counted yet

385
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,600
Shouchang, Zhongfu, Lu Xun

386
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,040
They each wrote several

387
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,560
Plus the others.

388
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,960
In Anhui dialect, this is called silt

389
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,560
What do you mean by silt?

390
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
There are too many to put into use.

391
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,920
Blocked up

392
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,240
I found that you Anhui people

393
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,240
What's going on here?

394
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,000
Duan Qirui from Anfu

395
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,920
Xu Shu from Anhui.

396
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,120
We have ChenDuxiu and Hushi in Peking University

397
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
You, Gao Yihan are from Anhui.

398
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,560
And the director of the metropolitan police department.

399
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,160
He's also from Anhui.

400
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,760
You all share the same hometown

401
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
Why can't you just bend the rules for old folks

402
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,600
No wonder Tang Erhe said

403
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,280
He just cant handle you people.

404
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,080
I think this Tang Erhe guy

405
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,280
Hardly a good one

406
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Indeed

407
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
He seems to pick on Zhongfu a lot recently.

408
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
It's not him targeting Zhongfu

409
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
It's Zhongfu who has gone too far recently.

410
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,440
Brother Yin Mo, I don't like the sound of that

411
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,040
How come Zhongfu went too far?

412
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,280
Haven't you read these days' newspapers?

413
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,960
They're all coming at Zhongfu.

414
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
All kinds of critisizing

415
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Now even Mr. Cai is involved

416
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,000
Laoshen

417
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
I think where you stand is not the right side

418
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,720
Who are you defending?

419
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,200
There is no problem where I stand

420
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
I'm worried about Mr Cai.

421
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,240
I heard this morning.

422
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
Fu Zengxiang called Mr. Cai again

423
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
Asked him to go to the Ministry of Education.

424
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,360
Guess it's about Zhongfu again

425
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,760
Brother Juemin

426
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,440
You know where my heart favors

427
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
I support you and Chen Duxiu in developing a new culture

428
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
But now the pressure is too heavy

429
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,160
We are all responsible for the fate of our country

430
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,680
No personal feelings should be mixed into this

431
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,200
This is a joke, isn't it, Brother Yuanshu?

432
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,520
Is this a matter of personal feelings?

433
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,520
This is about principle and axiom.

434
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,480
Isn't it

435
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,840
Axiom

436
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,360
Even Axiom has people's judgement in it

437
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,800
Now Zhang Changli is putting "New Youth"

438
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,720
"Trendy"

439
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
And "The Nation"

440
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,400
These three magazines on a trial table

441
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Accusing you, Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu

442
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
That you are sinners against the law and axiom

443
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
He also wants to impreach me as the Minister of Education

444
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,000
And you, the president of Peking University.

445
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,120
Yesterday

446
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,720
Ma Jichang also took some copies of New Youth.

447
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
Made a scene at the presidential palace

448
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,360
Requested Xu Shichang to put cuffs on you and ChenDuxiu

449
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,960
Said you two are endangering the government

450
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
No mercy shall be spared

451
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,640
Look at these newspapers and magazines.

452
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,280
It's all news about Peking University.

453
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,040
The chairman of the Confucius School in Anhui

454
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,400
Is it Ma Jichang?

455
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,840
He came to Beijing

456
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,720
Came here

457
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,160
Not alone

458
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,920
He also brought several.

459
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
The remnants of Tongcheng School

460
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,520
Came all the way just to complaining

461
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,440
Not only these

462
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,760
Police Chief Wu Bingxiang

463
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,640
He sent me a watch list.

464
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,520
There is your Peking University in it.

465
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,400
ChenDuxiu and LiDazhao

466
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,040
Brother Yuanshu, nothing you told me is new

467
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
As for those I dont know

468
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,440
and whatever you didn't tell me.

469
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,520
It's also within my expectation

470
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,360
I want to thank you though

471
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,840
For your care and support for Peking University.

472
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Brother Juemin

473
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,200
I want to remind you that you need to reconsider your approach

474
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,360
Adapting and ajusting

475
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,360
You know me well

476
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,920
Me, Cai Yuanpei, not that kind of bull.

477
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,760
I'll be accommodating where I can.

478
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
I will see myself out

479
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,040
It was nice seeing you

480
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,320
Till next time

481
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,880

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,000

LaoJiang

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,840
Go back to Peking University first.

486
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,160
Just drop me off here

487
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,560
You go back first.

488
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,120
All right

489
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,440

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Yep

500
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,400


501
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,680
What newspaper do you want?

502
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,560
I'll take the Gazette.

503
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,920
Yes

504
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,840
thank you

505
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,560
You're welcome.

506
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:54,720


507
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,760
Take care, sir.

508
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,400
good

509
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680

517
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160


518
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,320
You all

519
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,680
I said to Cai Heqing

520
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
University is the leader of all educational insititues

521
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,920
Shall be the moral example for all else

522
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Cai Heqing, you are the principal.

523
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,160
Your job should be to discipline teachers

524
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,120
Instead what do you think you are doing?

525
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,200


526
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
Advocating for those people

527
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Shouting loud about get rid of the tranditional test system

528
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,880
This old man will never give consent

529
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,080
Exactly

530
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,120
I am getting close to my end

531
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,320
The first 30 years in my life, all the wealth and fame are like ashes now

532
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,520
Old I might be, tough I will be

533
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
I'd rather die to see you get your way

534
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,240
What Qingong said is true

535
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,560


536
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440


537
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,640
That is well-said, Qingong

538
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,440
Yes

539
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,400
Good point!

540
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,360


541
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,080


542
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,040
Please enter

543
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
please

544
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,760
You all

545
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,040


546
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,200
I also said to Cai Heqing.

547
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,000


548
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,280
In this world, only true academic with true moral

549
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,280
can be the unique one urging others to follow

550
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,760
Everybody

551
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
In recent years, Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi of Peking University

552
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,160
with Qian Xuantong has repeatedly challenged me.

553
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,560
Defaming me as a nutjob of Tongcheng School

554
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
I never responded.

555
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,440
This open letter published today

556
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
together with the novel Jingsheng

557
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,360
is the reply I have for the so-called new culture school

558
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
A formal respond

559
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,600
good

560
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,840
Lin gong

561
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,320
Don't you have another novel?

562
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,040
"YaoMeng"?

563
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
When will it be published

564
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,920
I have withdrawn that novel.

565
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:02,960
Withdrawn

566
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,520
Fengzai

567
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,560
Wasn't Feng Zai here just now?

568
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,040
Teacher!

569
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,840
Fengzhun went to work-study mutual aid society again.

570
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,080
Trying to break them

571
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
Above is our investigation of Zhang Fengzai

572
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
from work-study mutual aid society

573
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,280
Yannian

574
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
What do you have in mind?

575
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,080
We were thiking

576
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,520
First of all, keep our heads low

577
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
We must expose this plot

578
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,960
in the congressional debate next week

579
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,000
It'll be better if we could convince Yi Qunxian's father

580
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
that he can side with us

581
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,560
Other than that

582
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
tailing Zhang Fengzai

583
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,280
See if we can find evidence

584
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,800
Evidence that he bought off those journalists.

585
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,480
And then make it public.

586
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:49,680


587
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,240
Qunxian

588
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,600
Are you sure you can convince your father?

589
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,160


590
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
We can't do it alone.

591
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,640
Mr Shouchang, do you know Mr Zhang Shizhao?

592
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
He used to be my dad's boss

593
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
If he is willing to come forward.

594
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
There may be a turnaround.

595
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,080
No problem.

596
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
Mr. XingYan happens to be in Beijing.

597
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,360
I can take you to him.

598
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,480
good

599
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,520
Have you found out any of the reporters?

600
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
I glanced at the list.

601
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,400
There is an English journalist Edward.

602
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,560
And Japanese journalist Sato Tetjiro.

603
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
Okay, let's start with these two

604
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,480
Mr Shouchang

605
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Mr Cai asked you to hurry to the principal's office.

606
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,800
Said there was something important to discuss.

607
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,840
Take seat

608
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,440
I'm sorry, Mr Cai.

609
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,240
I'm late.

610
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
Mr. Shouchang, please sit down

611
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:49,840
Yes

612
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,120
what's up

613
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,160
Linshu asked Zhang Shizhao sent me a message the day before yesterday.

614
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
Said that he had already pull back that novel

615
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
That second one was withdrawn.

616
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,960
But yesterday

617
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,040
He published an open letter to me.

618
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,320
today

619
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
The novel came out

620
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,240
A novel called "Yao Meng"

621
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
Yucai you are a novelist.

622
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
You shall be the one to have a better look at this

623
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,560
This "Yao Meng"

624
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200


625
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,160
"Yao Meng" is about

626
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,560
A man named Zheng Sikang

627
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,040
Sleepwalking to the underworld

628
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,840
Saw a place

629
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,320
It's called a simple words school.

630
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
The school is full of little devil-like being

631
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
There is a pair of couplets in the hall.

632
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
Saying: Simple words can connect to spirit

633
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,440
How incredible is "Hongloumeng" and "Shuihuzhuan"

634
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Tranditional speech has lost its charm

635
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,880
Who the hell is Ou Yangxiu, Han Yu?

636
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,000
There is also a hall called "End of Conficous" in the school.

637
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,840
Also a couplet there

638
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,880
Animals are truely free with no bounds from morality

639
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,000
Being noble is troublesome might as well lose it all

640
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Yuan Xu, the headmaster of the school

641
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
Is whom Zhu Xi mentioned in the book Analects of Confucius.

642
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
called Cai Dagui

643
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
This obviously refers to Mr Cai.

644
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,240
Dean Tian Heng

645
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,000
Deputy Provost Qin Ershi

646
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
They also allude to brother Zhongfu and Shizhi respectively.

647
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,920
These creatures described in the novel

648
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
They took a strong stand on bring the end to Confucious

649
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,280
prmoting simple words

650
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,640
Shouting about abolish ancient Chinese literature

651
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,520
What happened after is

652
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
they pissed off Asura King of the underworld

653
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,040
So

654
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,320
Asura ate them all

655
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
Turned them into smelly feces.

656
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,920
Yucai, I didn't hear you clearly

657
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,760
Was it they ate us

658
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Or they ate smelly feces?

659
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,200
Eat us up

660
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,280
Turn into smelly feces.

661
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,880
I thought they had a fece feast

662
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
Zhongfu, don't make fun of it at this time.

663
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
It should be said that Lin Jing's novel is very repulsive

664
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,880
But, I think what's worse

665
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,680
is this article on newspaper Public Opinion

666
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
"The recent changes of Peking University's ideological trend"

667
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,320
This article is completely

668
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,000
The tone of a politician.

669
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,240
It says

670
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,720
since Cai Yuanpei took charge of Peking University

671
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
hired wrong people

672
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,160
Corruption of scholars' habits is obvious to all.

673
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,160
Professor Chen Duxiu of Peking University

674
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
Regard oneself as the leader of the new school.

675
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,360
About the teachers

676
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,000
that it's not only Chen Duxiu

677
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,680
There are also Hu Shi, Li Dazhao, Qian Xuantong.

678
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,680
Liu Bannong, Gao Yihan and more

679
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Students are following blindly

680
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
Exaggeration everywhere

681
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
And the article also said

682
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
The new trend of thought in Peking University

683
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,600
Has caused public opposing

684
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,920
The Ministry of Education has ordered Peking University

685
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,720
that Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi and Qian Xuantong.

686
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,760
The three men are to expelled.

687
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,160
Ah, this

688
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,680
I was on my way here just now.

689
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,720
Bought Shenzhou Daily newspaper

690
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,040
The "Bangu communication" column said

691
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
Chen Duxiu Hu Shi

692
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,360
Tao Menghe and Liu Bannong

693
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,360
Government has laid its hand already

694
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,000
It said Chen Duxiu had a pessmistic attitude

695
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
and has left Peking University

696
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,040
They are not letting this just settle down

697
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,800
I've already put up with it again and again.

698
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,960
However, these people are pushing even harder

699
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,680
Heavy clouds upon a city can be stressful

700
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,800
But sun wil always come out and tear the darkness apart

701
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
Then let me, this so-called Cai Dagui

702
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,480
go into battle and fight

703
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,640
Great, Caigong

704
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,840
Even though I'm a smelly shit.

705
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,600
I wont bend

706
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
This pen in my hand can sweep a thousand troops

707
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
We will keep going

708
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,520
In his poem "The Song of the Stormy Petrel"

709
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,800
Russian writer Gorky wrote this

710
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
This one line

711
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,760
"Let the tempest come strike harder!"

712
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,920
Recently

713
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Linshu, who claimed to be a Qing imperial scholar had a big talk.

714
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,080
Claiming to

715
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,720
Guard the code of education and ethics of the Republic of China

716
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Of course, he can talk whatever he wants

717
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,640
Nothing to do with me.

718
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
But look at his noisy manner.

719
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
I feel pity again.

720
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,200
I can't help trying to persuade him.

721
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,200
I want to discuss with you how I can persuade you.

722
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,800
Since you regarding yourself an old scholar of Imperial Qing

723
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,440
Then you should not care about matter of Republic of China

724
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,560
Worry less is good for you

725
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,360
After WW1, we see how right triumphs over might

726
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
Did you?

727
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,880
A person who claims loyalty to the Imperial Qing

728
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Come to the Republic of China

729
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
Let a man named Zheng Sikang

730
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,040
Sleepwalking to the underworld

731
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,240
Seeing creatures roaming in Simple Word School

732
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,080
putting end to Confucious

733
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
advocating for mordern Chinese

734
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,800
talking about abolish classical Chinese

735
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,920
As a result

736
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,400
provoked Asura King and had them all eaten

737
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,200


738
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,240
Not only that

739
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
even turned them into smelly feces.

740
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,800
So I was thinking

741
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,840
that no one

742
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,000
shall trying to stop the time from moving forward

743
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
If you have to

744
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,320
only one outcome

745
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,760
Which is?

746
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,760
Run over your leg.

747
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:28,720
Okay, okay, okay.

748
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm telling those stubborn ghosts from old times

749
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
People with outdated minds

750
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
You should stick to your principles.

751
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,640
Stand up

752
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,040
Discuss with us

753
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,640
If you want to hide behind others

754
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,920
counting on them to cover you

755
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,440
And put it in violence towards

756
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
those who oppose you

757
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,040
so you can feel better

758
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,760
Or even write a nonsense novel.

759
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,960
to relax yourself

760
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,120


761
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,840
Make up a rumor and be relieved.

762
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,880
Then it's merely a boring move.

763
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,280
Notice today.

764
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,080
Those young people already awaken

765
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
thay are not afraid

766
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,640
The devastation from your side

767
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,560
You who claimed to be the noble man

768
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,040
You can never destroy the spirit of these young people.

769
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,920
Even back then, the tyrannical Russia

770
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
has killed countless aspiring young people

771
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,280
with extreme cruelty

772
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,960
Who would know, it is their blood

773
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,120
eventually

774
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,400
cultivating the flower of revolutionary freedom

775
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,640
Those black prison cells

776
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,760
instead, became the place for fighters to rest

777
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,880
after they completed the great fight

778
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,040
The oppression from the government

779
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
might as well provides some leisure

780
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,600
for us revolutionary

781
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,600
This growling everlasting river

782
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,720
No one can stop it.

783
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
Long live the New Culture Movement!

784
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,320


785
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,600
Long live!

786
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,240
Long live!

787
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,000
Fellow citizens

788
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,000
We advocate a new culture.

789
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
Is to seek liberation in all aspects.

790
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,320
Emancipation of the mind

791
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,360
Political liberation

792
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
The liberation of economy, the liberation of men and women

793
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,480
And the liberation of education.

794
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
All have to rise above from the hell beneath

795
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,120
and see the broad daylight

796
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
Our Chinese nation

797
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,640
We are born with greatest ability

798
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
The deeper the oppression.

799
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
The greater the resistance.

800
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,040
The more you pressed a spring

801
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,560
The faster it bounces back

802
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,560
I dare to say this

803
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,920
some other day

804
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,920
Reform of the Chinese nation

805
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,920
Will be more completed than any other nation

806
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,040
more thoroughly

807
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,040
Our society

808
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,880
will have a brighter future

809
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
than all the others

810
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,440
Fellow citizens

811
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
We shall work hard

812
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,240
Go forward all the way

813
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,000
Our golden world

814
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,920
Our glorious world

815
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,440
is right in front of us

816
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,800
Great

817
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,240
New culture movement!

818
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:24,960
Long live the New Culture Movement!

819
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,320
Long live the New Culture Movement!

820
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:26,800
Long live the New Culture Movement!

821
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:26,880


822
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,480
Long live the New Culture Movement!

823
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:28,720


824
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,920
Long live the New Culture Movement!

825
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,400
Zhang Fengzai, what the hell is going on?

826
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,360
You promised me again and again that you would withdraw the manuscript.

827
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,000
Why is it published now?

828
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
Explain it to me.

829
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,960
Sir

830
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,560
I did convey it to the newspaper.

831
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
Your request to withdraw the manuscript

832
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,280
And they agreed.

833
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,640
I don't know

834
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
What went wrong?

835
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,080
Zhang Fengzai, you are no longer my student.

836
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,320
You put me in this difficult situation

837
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,440
Made me an ungrateful oathbreaker

838
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,840
Now how can I face Mr.Cai, face the public

839
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,880
Sir, I have sent a letter to Cai Yuanpei.

840
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,320
Explained this

841
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
I will take all the responsibility.

842
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
Will Ji Yuanpei listen to your explanation?

843
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,760
Can you even carry a responsibility this heavy?

844
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,320
You're a traitor.

845
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,880
A shameless clown who deceives others.

846
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,040
Teacher, let's calm down

847
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
I say it's not a bad thing to confront them openly

848
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,240
Anyway, next week.

849
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
We will face Cai Yuanpei

850
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,320
In court in front of the Congress.

851
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,600
Teacher

852
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,920


853
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,320
Changli

854
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,160
I am a scholar, you are a politician

855
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,680
We are not on the same path

856
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
Now leave

857
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,840
I never want to see you again.

858
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,800
But teacher

859
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,640
Leave now. I'm tired

860
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,080
Teacher

861
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,960
I will leave now

862
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,720
Newpaper

863
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,520
Get your newspaper

864
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,280
Just came out, "New Youth"

865
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,960
"Weekly Review" "Trendy"

866
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,680
Peking University launched a big counterattack.

867
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,200
"New Youth"

868
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,160
"Weekly Review"

869
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,280
Come and read the newspaper

870
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,040
Cai Yuanpei responded to Lin Qinnan.

871
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
Re-discussion on new culture proposition

872
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,560
See how Chen Duxiu face the rumors about Peking University.

873
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,400
Li Dazhao on the fierce battle between the old and new thoughts

874
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,040
Lu Xun sent another message to warn the remnants

875
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,080
Paper

876
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,160
Grab your newpaper

877
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
Sell newspapers

878
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm sold out.

879
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,200


880
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
Now Comrade Yu Xiusong, please

881
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,960
Tell everyone about their tasks tonight.

882
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,680
All right

883
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
Let me explain it first.

884
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
This action is forbidden to record.

885
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,520
Now hear me out

886
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,640
This is what we will do tonight

887
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,360
The first group

888
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
He Mengxiong and Shi Cuntong

889
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,880
One of you is responsible for escorting Yi Qunxian

890
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,560
to meet Congressman Yi kuilong.

891
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,320
You are to convince Yi Kuilong.

892
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,840
so he will cancel the joint proposal with Zhang Changli

893
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,520
pull off impeachment of Minister of Education Fu Zengxiang

894
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,040
and Cai Yuanpei, President of Peking University

895
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,400
Also, he wil not talk in the court

896
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,800
But what if my dad doesn't want to see us?

897
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,920
Mr. Li Dazhao said

898
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,560
Mr. Zhang Shizhao.

899
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,600
already called your father

900
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,040
He will meet you

901
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,000
In addition to hand over

902
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,120
Mr. Zhang Shizhao's letter.

903
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,400
More importantly

904
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,920
Convincing Yi Kuilong

905
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,120
to work with us

906
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,480
Whether your task is a success or not

907
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
it's the key to our whole mission that day.

908
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:34,960
clear

909
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,280

910
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,000

911
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,080


912
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,960
Second group

914
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,800
You go find that journalist

916
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,600
Expose Zhang Fengzai's plot

917
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,440
And win his support

918
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,000

Guo Xingang and Liu Haiwei

926
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,840
You are both students of Peking University.

927
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,880
It's better you stay away from the public's eye

928
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
So you two and Bailan will collect and sort out related information

929
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,480
Print it out

930
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,440
We can use it later

931
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,080
clear

932
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,440
Task assignment is complete.

933
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,320
Feeling confident?

934
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,960
Yes

935
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,760

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,320
Yes

937
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,480
Uncle, I don't know what happened these two days.

938
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,480
I have this bad feeling.

939
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,280
what's up

940
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,920


941
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,040
You sent that letter to Cai Yuanpei?

942
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,360
It's been several days

943
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
Nothing happened since

944
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,120
What does the letter say?

945
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,480
I said I was a student in Peking University.

946
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
also a reporter working with several different paper

947
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,840
Lin shu was my teacher in Wuchang Middle School.

948
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,200
He taught me

949
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,440
I refered his two novels

950
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,240
To "Xin Shen News"

951
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
and the "Shenzhou Daily"

952
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,240
Lin shu did ask me to

953
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,920
withdraw "Yao Meng"

954
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
But by the time they have already printed it

955
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
It didn't go as he wanted

956
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
This responsibility should be borne by me.

957
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,840
But I think

958
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,520
Lin shu's two novels

959
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,280
are truly of the best literature

960
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,200
Peking University should have bigger heart

961
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,720
and publish them in school

962
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,160
Silly

963
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,560
Didn't you add fuel to Cai Yuanpei's fire?

964
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,160
Now he wont spare you

965
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,000
Exactly what I want

966
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,720
The moment he's onto me, all his so-called free thoughts

967
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,200
and compatibility will be blown away

968
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,320
You are a moth to a flame.

969
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Ok, you have balls

970
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,600
By the way

971
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,240
I called Wu Bingxiang.

972
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,000
As soon as you graduate from university

973
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,800
Go to the metropolitan police department to take office.

974
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,720


975
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,840
You can pick any title you want

976
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,400


977
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,120
I won't dissapoint you

978
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,040
A uni student majors in law

979
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,960
Uncle, actually, I do want to stay in Peking University.

980
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,880
They always say

981
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,520
In the past, Peking University had a lot of money and people were stupid.

982
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
It's easy to make a living and win some fame

983
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,560
Did you learn nothing all these years?

984
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
Nothing at all?

985
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,160
Mind full of shit

986
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,800
You are exactly the kind that Chen Duxiu and Lu Xun talked about

987
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,960
A sanctimonious person

988
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,160
Rogue under a mask of scholar

989
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,560
Do bad things in the name of academic justice

990
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
This is you right here

991
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,360
Well, I learnt it all from you

992
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:12,880


993
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,120
A gentleman shall be like orchid

994
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,560
You should know yourself better

995
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll do it

996
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,080
Need me to move a heavy pot after all

997
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Uncle, stop talking about me.

998
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
How's it going for you to go to Congress the day after tomorrow?

999
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,640
The proposal was handed in early.

1000
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,560
Yi Kuilong will take the lead

1001
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,440
He will explain the proposal the day after tomorrow.

1002
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,600
So I can hide behind the scenes and watch.

1003
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,760
I see, stay out of the mess

1004
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,920
Do you think their proposal can be passed?

1005
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
No way

1006
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,040
Pass a motion

1007
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,760
Two thirds of the votes are required.

1008
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,640
Most members of Congress

1009
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,560
They agree or sympathize with the new culture movement

1010
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,200
There are many friends of Cai Yuanpei too

1011
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,400
It's impossible they will pass the proposal

1012
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,040
We planned all this

1013
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,960
It's only a show to disgust

1014
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,960
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu

1015
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,080
Shaking public opinion a bit is the bonus

1016
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,920
along with put more pressure on the government.

1017
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,680
That's all

1018
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,960
By the way, the most important thing is journalists.

1019
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,840
The congressmen plus audience that day wont make a big number

1020
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Not enough

1021
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,360
Without the posture of a large number of journalists

1022
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,360
This show will fail

1023
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
Rest assured.

1024
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
I've arranged everything.

1025
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,160
Nothing that money can't reslove

1026
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,320
Is the manuscript ready?

1027
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,040
You can trust me

1028
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,240
Be cautious

1029
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Caution is the parent of safety

1030
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,120
Understood
