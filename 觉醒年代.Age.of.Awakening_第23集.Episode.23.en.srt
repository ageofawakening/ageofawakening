00:00:00,607 --> 00:00:03,596
[Episode Twenty-three]

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,280
Three working groups are struggling to operate.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,400
No customers in the canteen.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,840
The laundry team can't attract guests either.

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
Take the risk of showing a movie before barely losing money.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,680
In the long run, it will be unsustainable.

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,120
Now this is happening.

9
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,040
Overturned the public opinion that originally supported us.

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,520
Comrades, we can't wait and see.

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,280
We have to dig out the man behind this.

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,960
I disagree with you.

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,520
I think this article is not a bad thing.

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
Think about someone attacking us.

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
Actually, they are advertising for us for free.

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,280
You should thank him.

17
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,640
I think so too

18
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,920
I think this is a chat.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,200
Actually, it's helping us promote it.

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,400
Think about it.

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,880
Aren't we pursuing the desired freedom?

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,920
If it is

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
Then what do we have to fear?

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,400
I disagree

25
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,040
I don't agree either.

26
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,560
It is clearly destroying us.

27
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,680
He is in this one.

28
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
It has to be a little extreme.

29
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,920
Yannian

30
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Yannian

31
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,320
what's up

32
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,360
Yannian

33
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
I met some strangers at the door just now.

34
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
They asked me about the work-study mutual aid society.

35
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,560
I asked who they were looking for.

36
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,600
They said to find Yi Qunxian.

37
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,200
I see a policeman.

38
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,240
I said I didn't know.

39
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
I guess they'll find it here soon.

40
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,880
So I plugged in the front yard door.

41
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,920
It's over, it's over.

42
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,360
My dad sent for me.

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
Well, I-I don't want to go back with him

44
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,000
Please help me.

45
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
The capital is the first good place.

46
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,960
Do they dare to rob people?

47
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
When we are vegetarians.

48
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Don't be afraid, Comrade Qun.

49
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,400
We protect you.

50
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,480
So you and He Mengxiong

51
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,320
Take her out the window of the laundry room.

52
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,520
Go to the French Academy.

53
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,120
Other girls go back to the dormitory for cover.

54
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,800
Gay men follow me to open the door.

55
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Ok.

56
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,720
go

57
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,640
Open the door

58
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,280
open the door

59
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,640
Coming

60
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,600
open the door

61
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,280
What are you doing?

62
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
We are entrusted by Congressman Yi Yulong.

63
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,160
Looking for his daughter, Miss Yi Qunxian.

64
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,240
Then why come to us?

65
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,600
We received a report.

66
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
Miss Yi was deceived into joining the work-study mutual aid society.

67
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,080
Live here.

68
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,120
There is no such person.

69
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,400
We don't know her.

70
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,280
Yes

71
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,560
We don't know her.

72
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,040
You guys are wrong.

73
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
We are all students from other places here.

74
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
not have

75
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,040
not have

76
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Where is the dormitory?

77
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,680
Do you have a search warrant?

78
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,800
This is not a search.

79
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
This is a routine inspection.

80
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Please don't interfere with our official duties.

81
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,360
go

82
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,600
go

83
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
Why? Girls' dormitory

84
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,960
stop

85
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Go to what?

86
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,240
pour away the water

87
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
Is it illegal?

88
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,080
All stand up.

89
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
take out

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
Did you report to the sheriff's boys' dormitory?

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
Report to the police station immediately when you find Yi Qun.

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,240
Dare to secretly hell to pay?

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,680
go

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Xiusong Qiaonian

95
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,920
See the police off, sir.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,640
good

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,680
How about it?

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,400
Am I doing okay?

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,040
Tebiebang

100
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
You are the smartest.

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,200
Close doors and windows.

102
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
Theft prevention and theft prevention

103
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,440
wonton

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Pan

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
Close doors and windows.

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
Theft prevention and theft prevention

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
wonton

108
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,760
Pan

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
Close doors and windows.

110
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Comrade Yi Qunxian

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,440
If you don't mind.

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Don't abandon

113
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,120
rise

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,640
go

115
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,400
Push hard

116
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,320
go

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,200
Slow down, slow down.

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,760
Haven't seen stepping on people?

119
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,720
Never seen it. Never seen it.

120
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
ok, thanks

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
I'm sorry to ask.

122
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
Do you know a trampling man?

123
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
Excuse me, do you know trampling people?

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,720
never heard

125
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,840
I told you that Peking University's law department is so big.

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,520
Finding someone is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you sure that person is from Peking University?

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
be

129
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,640
He interviewed me twice in private.

130
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
But as soon as I mentioned you to him

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,480
He just prevaricated.

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
There must be something hidden.

133
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Just this man.

134
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,240
This man

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,520
Are you sure?

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm sure.

137
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,680
That's bad.

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,200
You don't know him?

139
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
I know more than that.

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,760
This man's name is Zhang Fengzai

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
I dealt with him when I was in Japan.

142
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,800
Retro Lin Ye's students

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Disciple of Huang Kan

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,800
Typical royalists.

145
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
Who cares about his students?

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
I'll catch him and ask him.

147
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
You're just going after people.

148
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
When the time comes, people bite to death and don't admit how strong they are.

149
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
How do you know if you don't ask?

150
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
Aren't there a few problems now?

151
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,440
We have no direct evidence for the first bite.

152
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
To prove that he wrote the article.

153
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
Second, the struggle between the new culture and the retro school

154
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
Now it is in the self-heating stage.

155
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
Don't involve Mr. Shouchang and Mr. Shizhi again

156
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
还有陈独秀

157
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,080
I think there is a big picture behind this.

158
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
Yannian makes sense.

159
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,760
came out

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,720
Hide! Hide!

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,280
hurry up

162
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,920
It's too late.

163
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,720
Play it by ear.

164
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,920
act according to circumstances

165
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Yannian

166
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,480
Then who kicks people?

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Ah, it's crowded

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,080
Step on people

169
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Who are you

170
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,680
this

171
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,040
Forget about us.

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,400
I interviewed him a few days ago.

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Isn't this Miss Yi?

174
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,160
long time no see

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I remember, Mr garlic clove.

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,400
What's wrong with me?

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,360
be occupied

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,360
Tell me about it.

179
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,200
Did you write this article?

180
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,480
What newspaper?

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
It was not I who wrote it

182
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,760
You didn't write it.

183
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
You didn't write it. Who did?

184
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
Since the establishment of our mutual aid society

185
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,720
I was interviewed by one of your reporters.

186
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,720
And you're secretly dating Yi.

187
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,920
I've been interviewed twice.

188
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760
It puts the members of our mutual aid society

189
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,680
Family background is written with nose and eyes.

190
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
A mouthful of nonsense

191
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
You didn't write it. Then who did?

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,640
Tell you not to spill the beans.

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,440
Come and see.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
This signature is clearly a chat.

195
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
This won't work.

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,440
What's my name

197
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
My name is trampling.

198
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
Have anything to do with me

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Wrong person.

200
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,080
You can't go.

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
What, do you want to do it?

202
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,560
I won't do it.

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,840
You come back with me and tell them clearly.

204
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,720
Can I tell you?

205
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,680
You can't go.

206
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,240
Thousand what?

207
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,320


208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,120
This is Peking University.

209
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,560
Don't hurt yourself. Get up

210
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,680
Come back, you come back with me.

211
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,160
Call you

212
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,200
What are you doing?

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,920
Really, isn't it?

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,280
What are you doing?

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,760
You go back with me and make it clear.

216
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,640
What will I tell you?

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,520
I called someone.

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,600
He Mengxiong

219
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,120
What are you doing?

220
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,040
You can't criticize me in the mutual aid society

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,320
Now come and harass Mr. Zhang.

222
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,760
what proof do you have ？

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,760
fault

224
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
What do you mean, arch eyebrows?

225
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
If it weren't for your fault.

226
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
Why are we going to all this trouble?

227
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
What do you mean, I got into trouble first?

228
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,440
Advertising at that time

229
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,040
Did I ask everyone's opinion?

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,240
Everyone agreed.

231
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,200
You didn't object either.

232
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,200
Later, I invited reporter Zhang.

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
You have all been interviewed.

234
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,840
Why is it wrong now?

235
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
It's just me.

236
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't recognize it.

237
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,520
Mr. Zhang, you don't know

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,120
When the newspaper came out

239
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
A group of dogs appeared in Mutual Aid Society.

240
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
A pack of crazy dogs

241
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
They threw shit on me.

242
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
No matter how uncomfortable I am, I will complain.

243
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,720
No one listens to me either.

244
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,760
Let me tell you something.

245
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
I don't want to stay in this mutual aid club.

246
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,240
Liumei, this is your arm and elbow. Turn out.

247
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,760
If you have this attitude today

248
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,760
Our mutual aid society will fire you today.

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Be expelled.

250
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm not rare anymore.

251
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
Yi Qunxian, let me tell you.

252
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,040
Don't think your father is a congressman.

253
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,760
Just what?

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
I don't like you anymore.

255
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
Are you crazy, arch eyebrows?

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
You are really a rat shit.

257
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
Bad for us.

258
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,760
Who's rat shit?

259
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
I said you.

260
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,480
You can't escape marriage. Go home.

261
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
You can't get married when you go home.

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,960
Mom's face.

263
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,160
What if I can't get married?

264
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,960
Comrades

265
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,920
Don't be offended by me.

266
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,080
To be honest, I really care.

267
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,520
Our mutual aid society.

268
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
I especially hope that our mutual aid society

269
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
Like a grass.

270
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
After being moistened by rain and bathed by sunshine

271
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,200
Slowly grow into a towering tree.

272
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,280
I especially hope that our mutual aid society

273
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
Be able to flourish

274
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
So how could I possibly write this?

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
Plant this lousy article.

276
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,800
Don't explain to them, Mr. Zhang.

277
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,400
The people in their mutual aid society are one track mind.

278
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,880
be stubborn/obstinate

279
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,840
Don't listen to people.

280
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm telling you it's dark.

281
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
It's really dark.

282
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,760
I spent three days and three nights.

283
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
I can't finish this pain with you.

284
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Walk like this.

285
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,080
Find a coffee shop or a teahouse or something.

286
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,120
Let me tell you something.

287
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,120
I want to peel off their paintings layer by layer.

288
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,240
go

289
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,440
You're a traitor.

290
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
I bite you to death today

291
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,440
Qunxian

292
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Come back here!

293
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,280
long and slender eyebrows (of a woman)

294
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
I will kill you today.

295
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,000
Come back here!

296
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
Liu Mei, you're getting out of line.

297
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
This is arch eyebrows play it by ear?

298
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,560
can

299
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
Don't piss me off.

300
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,360
If he hadn't just stopped me.

301
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm going to bite her.

302
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,080
We didn't help each other, did we?

303
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,800
No, no.

304
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,280
Tebiebang

305
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
But Liu Mei is going alone now.

306
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Don't make this trampling worse.

307
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
You know this Chen Yannian?

308
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Is Chen Duxiu's eldest son.

309
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
He tricked me into making it up into the club by sweet words.

310
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,400
If we don't take him and his father

311
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
Their behavior was exposed to the world.

312
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,960
My arch eyebrows are unwilling to die.

313
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
In that case.

314
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
I can help you.

315
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,640
real or not

316
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
Don't underestimate me.

317
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,760
I'll tell you the truth

318
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,280
We have been brewing a big plan here.

319
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,840
come

320
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,440
My second uncle has submitted it to Congress.

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
Proposal on Impeaching Cai Yuanpei, President of Peking University

322
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
Who is your second uncle?

323
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,800
His name is Zhang Changli.

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,960
parliamentarian

325
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,520
That's the same as Yi Qunxian's father.

326
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,920
Isn't it

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,560
exactly

328
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
And this proposal

329
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
Is that we unite with Yi Manlong.

330
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
Submitted

331
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,280
This time, we must take Chen Duxiu and his gang

332
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
Pull down the altar

333
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
Pull Chen Duxiu and them off the altar

334
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
Just a bill, right?

335
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
Submit a bill to Congress

336
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,400
It's just our first step.

337
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
Our second step

338
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
Also contacted a number of

339
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,280
Domestic and foreign media reporters.

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,840
Look, these are all with us.

341
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,040
A list of journalists.

342
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,240
No, don't just talk to me

343
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
It's your turn to give me some information.

344
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,160
come on

345
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
Laoshen

346
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,880
These seven articles have similar themes.

347
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,920
Write fairly neatly.

348
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,640
Look at it. Put it in

349
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
Is it suitable for you under this column?

350
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,560
good

351
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,360
Pay close attention to the trial

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,960
This Chen Zhongfu

353
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,960
Didn't you make it clear that day?

354
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,640
He's in charge of New Youth.

355
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
I can't see him at night.

356
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
So many articles

357
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,920
How can two people finish watching it?

358
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
Zhong is as busy as a bee right now.

359
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
A lot of things are concentrated in

360
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
He's alone.

361
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,840
I don't know about New Tide.

362
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,560
Be besieged by people

363
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,840
He hurried to clear the gap.

364
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,240
You two have worked hard.

365
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,280
Here we come.

366
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,360


367
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,680
Here we come.

368
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
Send the manuscript again.

369
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm exhausted, you guys.

370
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
We didn't just send the son.

371
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,080
Or help came.

372
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,840
Have you finished proofreading?

373
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,400
Proofreading is finished.

374
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,880
good

375
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,920
Tak-brother

376
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,680
You call this a timely assistance.

377
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,480
Please

378
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,360
Thank you!

379
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,560
This spiritual food should have

380
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
Material food should also be available.

381
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
So let's hurry.

382
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,640
Brush the heat to send it over.

383
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,440
How many manuscripts have you received?

384
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,120
This has not been counted.

385
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,600
Shouchang Zhongfu Lu Xun

386
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,040
I wrote several articles by one person.

387
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,560
Plus the others.

388
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,960
Let's speak silt in Anhui dialect.

389
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,560
What do you mean silt?

390
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
There are too many to use.

391
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,920
Blocked up

392
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,240
I found that you Anhui people

393
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,240
What's going on here?

394
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,000
Duan Qirui, a blessed one.

395
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,920
Xu Shu belongs to Anhui.

396
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,120
This way, Chen Duxiu Hu Shi, Peking University

397
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
You Gao Yihan are from Anhui.

398
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,560
And the director of the metropolitan police department.

399
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,160
It's also from Anhui.

400
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,760
It's Du Township Party.

401
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
Why can't you just bend the rules?

402
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,600
No wonder that Tang Erhe said

403
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,280
I just don't like you people.

404
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,080
I think this one is called Sugar Ear.

405
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,280
Not a good thing.

406
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Just this one, Tom.

407
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I seem to have been picking on Zhongfu recently.

408
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
He's not picky.

409
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
It's Zhongfu who has gone too far recently.

410
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,440
Brother Yin Mo, I don't like to hear that.

411
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,040
Where can Zhongfu go too far?

412
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,280
Haven't you read these days' newspapers?

413
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,960
They're all coming at Zhongfu.

414
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
But you can say everything.

415
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Now Mr. Cai is involved

416
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,000
Laoshen

417
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
I think your position is very problematic.

418
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,720
Who are you defending?

419
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,200
It's not my position.

420
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
I'm worried about Mr Cai.

421
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,240
I heard this morning.

422
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
Fu Zengxiang put Mr. Cai again

423
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
Please go to the Ministry of Education.

424
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,360
Guess it's Zhongfu again.

425
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,760
Brother Zimin

426
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,440
You know my thinking tendency.

427
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
I support you and Chen Duxiu in developing a new culture.

428
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
But now the pressure is too great.

429
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,160
You are responsible for the country.

430
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,680
Not allowed to be mixed with personal feelings.

431
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,200
This is a joke, isn't it, uncle?

432
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,520
Is this a matter of personal feelings?

433
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,520
This is a principle and an axiom.

434
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,480
Isn't it

435
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,840
self-evident truth

436
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,360
Justice needs people to judge.

437
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,800
Zhang Changli holds New Youth.

438
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,720
Trendy

439
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
And "The Nation"

440
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,400
Three magazines complained everywhere.

441
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Say you Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu

442
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
A sinner who is actually a famous teacher of the law.

443
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
He wants to play a single illegally I this chief.

444
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,000
And you, the president of Peking University.

445
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,120
yesterday

446
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,720
Ma Jichang also took some copies of New Youth.

447
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
Make a scene at the presidential palace

448
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,360
Xu Shichang wants to confuse people with evil words.

449
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,960
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu who endanger Chao Gang

450
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
punish without leniency

451
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,640
Look at these newspapers and magazines.

452
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,280
It's all news from Peking University.

453
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,040
The president of this Confucius Church in Anhui

454
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,400
Is it Ma Jichang?

455
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,840
He came to Beijing.

456
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,720
Coming

457
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,160
Not only is he here.

458
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,920
He also brought several.

459
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
The remnants of Tongcheng School

460
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,520
Special complaint is coming.

461
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,440
I also want to tell you

462
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,760
Police Chief Wu Bingxiang

463
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,640
Also sent me a watch list.

464
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,520
There is your Peking University in it.

465
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,400
陈独秀和李大钊

466
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,040
Uncle, besides what you told me,

467
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
Outside of my knowledge

468
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,440
Is what you didn't tell me.

469
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,520
I was also expected.

470
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,360
I want to thank you.

471
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,840
Care and support for Peking University.

Brother Zimin

473
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,200
I want to remind you how to pay attention.

474
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,360
Be good at accommodation

475
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,360
You know

476
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,920
I, Cai Yuanpei, am not that kind of bull.

477
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,760
I'll be accommodating where I can.

478
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
Ok, leave now.

479
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,040
say goodbye to

480
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,320

A new newspaper

482
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,000
Do you want to buy a newspaper?

483
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,760
Daoxiao Noodles

484
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,680
old ginger

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,840
Go back to Peking University first.

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,160
You park your car on the side and I'll come down.

487
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,560
Go back first.

488
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,120

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:41,840

I'll say to Ji Heqing.

519
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,680
I say to Cai Heqing

520
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
Universities are national teachers' models.

521
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,920
The affiliation of Wuchang

522
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Cai Heqing, you are the principal.

523
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,160
Be a good teacher and don't be ridiculous.

524
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,120
And what do you call it?

525
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,200


526
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
And what are you shouting about?

527
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Abolish stereotyped writing in imperial examinations

528
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,880
The old man will never agree.

529
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,080
be

530
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,120
Old age is seventy.

531
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,320
The first 30 years of wealth and fame were like ashes.

532
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,520
Today's old age is still incomplete.

533
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
It's hard to fuck until you die.

534
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,240
The piano office is very

535
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,560
The piano office is based on it. Yeah

536
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440
The piano office is very

537
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,640
The public statement is reasonable.

538
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,440
That's very good.

539
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,400
Good point!

540
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,360
Good point!

541
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,080
everyone

542
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,040

I also told Cai Heqing.

546
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,200
I also tell Cheng Cai Ji Qing.

547
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,000
I also told Cai Heqing.

548
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,280
Only the world is truly academic and moral.

549
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,280
Be unique from the beginning, and make people follow.

550
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,760
Everybody, Gao Xian

551
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
In recent years, Chen Duxiu Hu Shi of Peking University

552
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,160
Qian Xuantong has repeatedly challenged me.

553
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,560
I choose to learn Uber for Tongcheng fallacy.

554
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
I haven't responded.

555
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,440
This open letter published today

556

Together with the novel Jingsheng

557
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,360
Even if I'm interested in the so-called new culture

558
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
Make a formal reply.

559
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,600
good

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,840
Lin gong

561
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,320
Don't you have another novel?

562
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,040
Demon Dream?

563
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
When will it be published

564
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,920
I have withdrawn that novel.

565
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:02,960
Withdrawn

566
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,520
Fengzai

567
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,560
Wasn't Feng Zai here just now?

568
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,040
Teacher!

569
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,840
Fengzhun went to work-study mutual aid society again.

570
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,080
Digging the wall.

571
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
The above is our work-study mutual aid society.

572
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
According to Zhang Fengzai's investigation

573
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,280
Yannian

574
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
What do you think next?

575
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,080
We think so.

576
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,520
First of all, it is quiet.

577
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Be sure to be in the congressional debate next week.

578
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,960
Expose their plot

579
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Of course it's best to convince.

580
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
Yi Qunxian's father turned his back.

581
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,560
Then there is.

582
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
We want to follow Zhang Fengzai in the dark

583
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,280
See if you can find it.

584
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,800
Evidence that he bought off those journalists.

585
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,480
And then make this evidence public.

586
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:49,680


587
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,240
Qunxian

588
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,600
Are you sure you can convince your father?

589
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,160
Did you convince your father to prepare the house?

590
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
We can't do it alone.

591
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,640
Mr Shouchang, do you know Mr Zhang Shizhao?

592
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
He used to be my dad's boss

593
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
If he is willing to come forward.

594
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
There may be a turnaround.

595
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,080
This is no problem.

596
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
Mr. Yan happens to be in Beijing.

597
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,360
I can take you to him.

598
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,480
good

599
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,520
Have you heard any reporters?

600
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
I glanced at the list.

601
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,400
I remember an English journalist Edward.

602
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,560
And Japanese journalist Sato Tetjiro.

603
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
Okay, let's start with these two people.

604
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,480
寿昌先生

605
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Mr. Ji asked you to hurry to the principal's office.

606
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,800
Said there was something important to discuss.

607
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,840
Why don't you sit down?

608
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,440
I'm sorry, Mr Cai.

609
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,240
I'm late.

610
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
Mr. Shouchang, please sit down

611
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:49,840
good

612
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,120
what's up

613
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,160
Linto Zhang Shizhao sent me a message the day before yesterday.

614
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
Said that he had already put the book to be published.

615
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
The second novel was withdrawn.

616
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,960
But yesterday

617
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,040
He published an open letter to me.

618
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,320
today

619
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
Just published this article.

620
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,240
A novel called "Demon Dream"

621
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
Yu you are a novelist.

622
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
I'll treat you to this week's Duke.

623
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,560
Let's learn about his "Demon Dream"

624
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
Demon Dream

625
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,160
"Demon Dream" is about

626
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,560
A man named Zheng Sikang

627
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,040
Sleepwalking to the underworld

628
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,840
Saw one.

629
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,320
It's called a self-talk school.

630
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
The school is full of charms.

631
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
There is a pair of couplets in front of the hall.

632
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
Connect the vernacular with the spirit.

633
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,440
Dream of the Red Mansion is incredible.

634
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
The bottom line is annoying for ancient prose.

635
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,880
What is Ouyang Xiu Han Yu?

636
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,000
There is also a death hole hall in the school.

637
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,840
There is also a couplet in front of the hall.

638
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,880
What's the use of freedom for animals?

639
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,000
Too bad things must be eliminated fundamentally.

640
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Yuan Xu, the headmaster of the school

641
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
Is Zhu Xi in the Analects of Confucius.

642
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
Cai Dagui mentioned

643
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
This obviously refers to Mr Cai.

644
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,240
Dean Tian Heng

645
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,000
Deputy Provost Qin Ershi

646
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
They also allude to brother Zhongfu and Shizhi respectively.

647
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,920
What about these demon people described in the novel?

648
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
Sink in the air and hang the dead hole hall

649
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,280
Sing self-talk poems

650
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,640
On Gao Abolishing Ancient Chinese Literature

651
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,520
result

652
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
Make asura king of the underworld angry.

653
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,040
in a pet

654
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,320
Eat all these people.

655
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
Turned into smelly feces.

656
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,920
Yu, I didn't hear you clearly

657
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,760
Yes, they ate us.

658
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Or put that smelly shit

659
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,200
Eat us up

660
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,280
Turn into smelly feces.

661
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,880
I thought I'd just eat it.

662
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
Zhongfu, don't make fun of it at this time.

663
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
It should be said that Lin Jing's novel is very bad

664
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,880
Actually, I think it's worse

665
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,680
It's this article in the public opinion newspaper.

666
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
Please look at the recent changes of Peking University's ideological trend.

667
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,320
This article is completely

668
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,000
The tone of a politician.

669
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,240
The article says

670
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,720
It is said that since Cai Yuanpei took charge of Peking University

671
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
Used by others.

672
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,160
Corruption of scholars' habits is obvious to all.

673
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,160
Professor Chen Duxiu of Peking University

674
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
Regard oneself as the leader of the new school.

675
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,360
What about the teacher?

676
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,000
Write Chen Duxiu sewn together.

677
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,680
There are mainly Hu Shi Li Dazhao Qian Xuantong.

678
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,680
Liu Bannong Gao Yihan et al.

679
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Students are even more enthusiastic.

680
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
There are also many people who quit Zhang Da.

681
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
And the article also said

682
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
The new trend of thought of Peking University

683
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,600
Has caused public habit.

684
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,920
The Ministry of Education has ordered Peking University

685
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,720
Take Chen Duxiu Hu Shi to Qian Xuantong.

686
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,760
The three men were expelled.

687
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,160
Ah, this

688
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,680
I was on my way here just now.

689
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,720
Buy Shenzhou Daily.

690
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,040
Inside the "half valley communication" said

691
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
Chen Duxiu Hu Shi

692
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,360
Tao Menghe et al.

693
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,360
Has been interfered by the government.

694
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,000
He also said Chen Duxiu had a negative attitude.

695
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
And has left Peking University.

696
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,040
The tree wants to be quiet but the wind never stops.

697
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,800
I'm already heading for the hills, putting up with it again and again.

698
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,960
However, the Si people are pressing hard.

699
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,680
The tension caused by the arrogance of evil forces

700
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,800
Shen Guang rises to the golden scales of the sun

701
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
Then let me sacrifice this so-called turtle

702
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,480
So we have to go into battle and kill.

703
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,640
Haocaigong

704
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,840
Even though I'm a smelly shit.

705
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,600
But you can't break your brows.

706
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
I will sweep a thousand troops with you.

707
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
Swing away with a drum

708
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,520
Russian writer Gorky

709
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,800
On the Song of Haiyan

710
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
There is such a saying

711
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,760
Let the storm come more violent.

712
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,920
recently

713
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Lin, who claimed to be a Qing-chamber juren, had a big talk.

714
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,080
Claiming to

715
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,720
Safeguard the Code of Famous Education of the Republic of China

716
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Of course, he can talk to himself.

717
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,640
Nothing to do with me.

718
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
But look at his noisy manner.

719
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
I feel pity again.

720
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,200
I can't help trying to persuade him.

721
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,200
I want to discuss with you how I can persuade you.

722
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,800
Since you are not a Chinese.

723
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,440
Then mind your own business.

724
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,560
Have less leisure and less leisure.

725
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,360
The recent triumph of justice

726
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
How are you?

727
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,880
A person who cleans the room.

728
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Come to the Republic of China

729
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
Let a man named Zheng Sikang

730
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,040
Sleepwalking to the underworld

731
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,240
I saw a group of enchantments in the vernacular school.

732
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,080
Gaoshou Kongtang

733
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
Singing vernacular poems

734
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,800
Talk about abolishing ancient prose.

735
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,920
result

736
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,400
Put asura king in the underworld

737
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,200
After getting angry.

738
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,240
Eat them all.

739
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
Turned into smelly feces.

740
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,800
That's why I thought

741
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,840
You can't try anyone.

742
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,000
The wheel that blocks the progress of history

743
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
You have to block it.

744
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,320
There was only one result.

745
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,760
What?

746
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,760
Run over your leg.

747
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:28,720
Okay, okay, okay.

748
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm telling those stubborn ghosts Chong

749
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
People with corrupt ideas

750
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
You should stick to your principles.

751
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,640
Stand up aboveboard.

752
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,040
Discuss with our new ideas.

753
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,640
If you want to hide behind others

754
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,920
Holding your great husband's thigh.

755
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,440
With brutal force

756
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
Those who oppress you

757
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,040
Take it out on you.

758
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,760
Or write a nonsense novel.

759
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,960
Koukuaikou

760
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,120


761
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,840
Make up a rumor and be relieved.

762
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,880
Then this is an extremely boring move.

763
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,280
Notice today.

764
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,080
If there is a truly awakened youth

765
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
So it's not afraid.

766
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,640
The devastation of your great husband.

767
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,560
You great husbands

768
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,040
Never destroy the spirit of these young people.

769
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,920
The tyrannical Russia of that day

770
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
I don't know how many cruel minds I used.

771
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,280
How many aspiring young people have been killed?

772
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,960
Who knows the blood of these young people?

773
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,120
Instead, it became

774
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,400
The soil for cultivating the flower of revolutionary freedom

775
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,640
Those dark prisons

776
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,760
Instead, he became an aspiring young man.

777
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,880
Rest place after hard work.

778
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,040
The oppression of an oppressive government

779
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
But for the sake of our revolution.

780
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,600
It provides some interesting things.

781
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,600
A long, deep stream like today.

782
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,720
I can't stop it.

783
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
Long live the New Culture Movement!

784
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,320


785
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,600
Long live!

786
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,240
Long live!

787
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,000
Fellow citizens

788
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,000
We advocate a new culture.

789
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
Is to seek liberation in all aspects.

790
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,320
Emancipation of the mind

791
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,360
Political liberation

792
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
The liberation of economy, the liberation of men and women

793
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,480
And the liberation of education.

794
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
All have to go from nine wrongs.

795
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,120
Seek the sky

796
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
Our Chinese nation

797
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,640
The greatest original ability.

798
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
The deeper the oppression.

799
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
The greater the resistance.

800
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,040
Store it for a long time

801
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,560
Make it quick.

802
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,560
I dare say a word.

803
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,920
some other time/day

804
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,920
Reform of the Chinese nation

805
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,920
Will be better than any other nation

806
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,040
All thoroughly.

807
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,040
Chinese society

808
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,880
Than any other nation

809
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
Du Guangming

810
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,440
Fellow citizens

811
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
We should work hard.

812
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,240
Go forward desperately.

813
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,000
Our golden world

814
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,920
Our glorious world

815
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,440
close at hand

816
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,800
Okay, okay, okay.

817
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,240
New culture movement party

818
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:24,960
Long live the New Culture Movement!

819
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,320
Long live the New Culture Movement!

820
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:26,800
Long live the New Culture Movement!

821
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:26,880


822
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,480
Long live the New Culture Movement!

823
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:28,720


824
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,920
Long live the New Culture Movement!

825
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,400
Zhang Fengzai, what the hell is going on?

826
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,360
You promised me again and again that you would withdraw the manuscript.

827
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,000
Why is it published again now?

828
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
You explain it to me.

829
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,960
sir

830
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,560
I did convey it to the newspaper.

831
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
Your request to withdraw the manuscript

832
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,280
And they agreed.

833
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,640
I don't know

834
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
Which link went wrong?

835
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,080
Zhang Fengzai, you are not my student.

836
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,320
Trapped me in a cruel and unjust place.

837
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,440
You call me face Cai Qing.

838
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,840
How to face the public

839
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,880
Mr. Wang has written to Cai Yuanpei.

840
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,320
Made an explanation.

841
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
I will take all the responsibility.

842
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
Will Ji Yuanpei listen to your explanation?

843
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,760
Can you afford this responsibility?

844
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,320
You're a traitor.

845
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,880
A mean person who deceives others.

846
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,040
Don't worry, don't worry.

847
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
In my opinion, it's all right to fall out.

848
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,240
Anyway, next week.

849
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
Just with Cai Yuanpei

850
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,320
Confronted in court in Congress.

851
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,600
my kind and respected master/teacher/mentor

852
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,920

Scholars and politicians

855
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,680
people of different aspirations or principles cannot get along together

856
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
You guys go.

857
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,840
I never want to see you again.

858
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,800
my kind and respected master/teacher/mentor

859
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,640
Let's go. I'm tired

860
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,080
my kind and respected master/teacher/mentor

861
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,960
The students excused themselves.

862
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,720
Sold it

863
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,520
I sold it. I sold it.

864
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,280
Look at the newly published New Youth

865
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,960
Weekly Review, Trendy

866
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,680
Peking University launched a big counterattack.

867
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,200

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
Re-discussion on new culture proposition

872
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,560
See Chen Duxiu face the rumors of Peking University.

873
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,400
Li Dazhao on the fierce battle between the old and new thoughts

874
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,040
Lu Xun sent another message to warn the elderly.

875
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,080
Selling newspaper

876
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,160

Sell newspapers

878
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm sold out.

879
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,200
Sold it

880
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
Let's invite Comrade Yu Xiusong.

881
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,960
Tell everyone about the division of tasks tonight.

882
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,680
good

883
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
Let me explain it first.

884
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
This action is forbidden to record.

885
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,520
Now I'd like to make an announcement.

886
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,640
Division of action tonight

Meet Congressman Yi Manlong.

Proposal of Cai Yuanpei, President of Peking University

895
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,400
Not enough to explain the proposal.

896
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,800
But what if my dad doesn't want to see us?

897
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,920
Mr. Li Dazhao said

898
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,560
Mr. Zhang Shizhao.

899
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,600
I already called your father.

900
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,040
He agrees with you.

901
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,000
In addition to handing over

902

903
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,400
More importantly

To convince senator Yi Manlong

905
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,120
Cooperate with our actions.

906
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,480
Can you finish your task?

907
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
It was the key to our whole mission that day.

908
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:34,960

909
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,280

You are a student of Peking University.

927
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,880
Unfavorable to appear in public

928
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
Take Prynne to collect and sort it out.

929
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,480
And mimeograph relevant evidence materials.

930
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,440
For use on the same day.

931
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,080
clear

932
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,440
Operation assignment is complete.

Have no confidence

Uncle, I don't know what happened these two days.

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,480
I always have a bad feeling.

939
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,280
what's up

940
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,920
what's up

941
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,040
Your letter to Cai Yuanpei has been delivered.

942
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,360
It's been several days

943
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
There is no movement at all.

944
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,120
What does the letter say?

945
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,480
I told him I was a student in Peking University.

946
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
And a reporter for a newspaper that looks after my children's home.

947
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,840
Lin is me in Wuchang Middle School.

948
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,200
A teacher at school.

949
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,440
Two of his novels

950
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,240
I recommended them to the New Declaration respectively.

951
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
And the shenzhou daily.

952
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,240
Lin did want me.

953
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,920
Withdraw "Demon Dream"

954
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
But since the newspaper has already published it.

955
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
Fail to fulfill one's wish

956
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
This responsibility should be borne by me.

957
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,840
But I think

958
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,520
Lin's two novels

959
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,280
Be called the best literature.

960
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,200
Peking University should have this mind.

961
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,720
They will be published in school.

962
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,160
silly lad/boy

963
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,560
Didn't you add fuel to Cai Yuanpei's fire?

964
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,160
He can spare you.

965
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,000
I just want to make him angry.

966
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,720
When he gets angry, his freedom of thought

967
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,200
The cover of compatibility will be broken.

968
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,320
You are a moth to a flame.

969
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Ok, have seed.

970
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,600
it suddenly occurs to me that

971
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,240
I called Wu Bingxiang.

972
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,000
As soon as you graduate from college

973
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,800
Go to the metropolitan police department to take office.

974
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,720
What? Pick it yourself.

975
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,840
What? Pick yourself.

976
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,400
What? Pick it yourself.

977
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,120
I can't wronged you.

978
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,040
College students studying law

979
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,960
Uncle, actually, I still want to stay in Peking University.

980
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,880
They always say

981
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,520
In the past, Peking University had a lot of money and people were stupid.

982
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
Have a great reputation and be confused.

983
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,560
Mingming, how do you know?

984
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
Qi Zhiping, how did you fix it?

985
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,160
Be confused and strong.

986
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,800
You are the kind that Chen Duxiu Lu Xun said.

987
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,960
sanctimonious person

988
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,160
Rogue is dressed as a scholar.

989
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,560
Do bad things under the signboard of learning.

990
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
It's you I'm talking about

991
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,360
Didn't you teach them all?

992
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:12,880


993
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,120
Junzi rulan

994
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,560
Take your own picture.

995
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll do it. I'll do it

996
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,080
I can't move potted plants.

997
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Uncle, stop talking about me.

998
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
How's it going for you to go to Congress the day after tomorrow?

999
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,640
The proposal was handed in early.

1000
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,560
Yi long ling xian

1001
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,440
He will explain the proposal the day after tomorrow.

1002
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,600
So I can hide behind the scenes and watch.

1003
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,760
Watch the excitement.

1004
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,920
Do you think their proposal can be passed?

1005
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
no way

1006
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,040
pass a motion

1007
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,760
Two thirds of the votes are required.

1008
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,640
Most members of Congress

1009
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,560
Agree or sympathize with the new culture.

1010
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,200
There are many old friends and new friends of Cai Yuanpei.

1011
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,400
How is it possible to pass the proposal?

1012
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,040
What a farce we made!

1013
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,960
Just want to feel sick.

1014
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,960
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu

1015
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,080
Create public opinion

1016
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,920
Put more pressure on the government.

1017
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,680
That's it.

1018
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,960
By the way, the most important thing is journalists.

1019
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,840
Members attending the meeting the day after tomorrow

1020
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
There are not too many people in attendance.

1021
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,360
Without the posture of a large number of journalists

1022
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,360
We can't make this farce.

1023
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
Rest assured.

1024
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
I've arranged everything.

1025
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,160
It's just spending more money.

1026
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,320
Is the manuscript ready?

1027
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,040
Don't worry about me.

1028
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,240
Be cautious again

1029
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
caution is the parent of safety

1030
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,120
My nephew understands.
