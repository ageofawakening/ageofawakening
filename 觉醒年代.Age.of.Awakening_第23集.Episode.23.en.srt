[Episode Twenty-three]

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,280
Three working groups are struggling to operate.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,400
No customers in the canteen.

[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

6
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,840
The laundry team can't attract guests either.

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
Only one making profits is the filming group, but barely.

8
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,680
We won't be able to last if it keeps up like this.

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,120
Not to mention now with this mess.

10
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,040
It overturned the public opinion that originally supported us.

11
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,520
Comrades, we can't just sit and wait for the end to come.

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,280
We must find out whoever is behind this.

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,960
I disagree with you.

14
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,520
I think this article is not a bad thing.

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, there is someone crticizing us.

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
But, that is also free advertising for us.

17
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,280
We probably should thank him.

18
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,640
I agree.

19
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,920
This Liao Zhi guy.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,200
He is promoting us right now.

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,400
Think about it.

22
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,880
Are we not pursuing the freedom that we wanted now?

23
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,920
If we are,

24
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
then what do we have to fear?

25
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,400
I disagree.

26
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,040
I don't agree either.

27
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,560
He is clearly badmouthing us.

28
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,680
Well, this article is...

29
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
It is a bit too aggressive and biased.

30
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,920
Yannian!

31
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Yannian!

32
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,320
What's wrong?

33
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,360
Yannian.

34
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
I met some strangers at the door just now.

35
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
They asked me about the work-study mutual aid society.

36
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,560
I asked who they were looking for.

37
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,600
They are looking for Yi Qunxian.

38
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,200
I noticed there was a policeman.

39
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,240
I said I didn't know.

40
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
But they'll know it's here soon.

41
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,880
So I locked up the front yard door.

42
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,920
Damn.

43
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,360
My dad must sent them to catch me.

44
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
I- I don't want to go back.

45
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,000
Please help me.

46
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
We are in the capital, the best city.

47
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,960
They can't take you against your will.

48
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
Who do they think we are?

49
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Don't be afraid, Comrade Qunxian.

50
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,400

Other girls go back to the dormitory, cover them.

55

All men, following me to open the door.

56
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Ok.

57
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,720

65

Then why come to us?

66
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,600
We received a report.

67
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
Miss Yi was deceived into joining the work-study mutual aid society.

68
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,080
She lives here.

69
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,120

75
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Didn't see her.

76
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,040
Me neither.

77
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Where is the girls' dormitory?

78
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,680
Do you have a search warrant?

79
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,800
This is not a search.

80
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
This is a routine inspection.

81
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Please don't interfere with our official duties.

82
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,600
Let's move.

83
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
What are you doing? This is girls' dormitory!

84
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,960
Stop!

85
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Where are you going?

86
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,240
Put away the water.

87
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
Is this legal?

88
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,080
Everyone, stand up.

89
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
Put your hands down.

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
Sir, no sign of her in the boys' dormitory.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
Report to the police station immediately when you find Yi Qunxian.

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,240
You will be punished if you hide her.

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,680
Let's go.

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Xiusong, Qiaonian.

95
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,920
See the police off.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,640
Okay!

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,680
How was it?

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,400
Was I doing okay?

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,040

If you don't mind.

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Of course I don't mind.

Go.

Slowly, slowly.

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,760
You know someone called "Cairen"?

119
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,720
No idea.

120
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
All right, thanks.

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
Excuse me, mind me asking something?

122
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
Do you know a man called "Cairen"?

123
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
Excuse me, do you know "Cairen"?

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,720
Never heard of that.

125
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,840
I told you that Peking University's law department is too big.

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,520
Finding someone is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you sure that person is from Peking University?

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
Yes.

129
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,640
He interviewed me twice in private.

130
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
But as soon as I mentioned introducing you guys to him.

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,480
He wouldn't give me a straight answer.

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
He must be hiding something.

133
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
That's the guy!

134
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,240
Him?

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,520
Are you sure?

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm sure.

137
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,680
This can't be good.

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Wait, you know him?

139
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
Not only know him.

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,760
This man's name is Zhang Fengzai.

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
I dealt with him when I was in Japan.

142
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,800
His teacher Lin Shu is a traditionalist.

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
He's a disciple of Huang Kan.

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,800
A typical royalist.

145
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
Who cares about whose student he is?

[He Mengxiong, Visiting student at Peking University]

147
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
I'll go and confront him.

148
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
You are gonna just go like this?

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
What if he denies it all?

150
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
We won't know if we don't act now.

151
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
Wait a second, we have few problems now.

152
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,440
First, we have no direct evidence

153
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
to prove that he wrote the article.

154
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
Second, the argument between the new culture and the traditionalists

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
is heating up every second.

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
We can't risk involving Mr. Shouchang and Mr. Shizhi again.

157
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
Also there is Chen Duxiu.

158
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,080
I think there is a bigger picture behind this.

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
Yannian makes sense.

160
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,760

161
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,720

162

Hurry up!

163

It's too late.

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,720
Play it by ear.

Oh no, it's Cairen.

170
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Who are you?

171
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,680
Huh?

172
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,040
You forgot about us already?

173
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,400
You just did the interview few days ago.

Isn't this Miss Yi?

175
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,160
Long time no see.

What is it, you want to talk to me?

178
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,360
Yes.

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,360
Now answer me.

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,200
Did you write this article?

181
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,480
What newspaper?

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
It was not me who wrote it

183
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,760
You didn't write it?

184
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
If it's not you, then who did?

185
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
Since the establishment of our mutual aid society,

186
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,720
the only interview we accepted was with you

187
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,720

Twice secretly.

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760
In this artice, all our members' family background was written about

190
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,680
with details.

191
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
But everything else was total nonsense.

192
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
You claimed you didn't write it, then tell me who did?

193
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,640
I am warning you, stop bullshiting.

194
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,440
You take a good look at it.

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
Signature for this article is Liao Zhi, clearly.

196
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
This won't work.

197
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,440
What's my name?

198
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
My name is Cairen.

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
This has nothing to do with me.

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
It's the wrong person.

201
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,080
You can't go.

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
What, you wanna fight now?

203
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,560
I won't do it.

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,840
You need to come with me and tell my friends what happened.

205
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,720
Why should I?

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,680
You can't go.

207
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,320
What are you doing?

208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,120
This is Peking University.

209
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,560
You are gonna get in trouble. Let go.

210
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,680
Wait, come with me.

211
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,160
You!

212
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,200
What are you doing?

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,920
So you wanna fight?

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,280
Wait, where are you going.

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,760
You come back with me and make it clear.

216
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,640
I have nothing to tell.

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,520
I am gonna call for help.

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,600
He Mengxiong!

219
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,120
What are you doing now?

220
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,040
Criticizing me in the mutual aid society is not enough,

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,320
now you harass Mr. Zhang as well?

222
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,760
What proof do you have?

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,760
No.

224
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
What do you mean, Liu Mei?

225
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
If it weren't for your fault,

226
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
why are we going through all this trouble?

227
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
What do you mean, I got into trouble first?

228
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,440
About advertising,

229
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,040
didn't I ask everyone's opinion?

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,240
Everyone agreed.

231
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,200
You didn't object either.

232
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,200
So I invited reporter Zhang.

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
You were all been interviewed.

234
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,840
How come when something went wrong,

235
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
It's my fault?

236
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
I am not responsible.

237
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,520
Mr. Zhang, you have no idea.

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,120
When the newspaper came out,

239
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
they turned into insane dogs.

240
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
A pack of crazy dogs.

241
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
They barked at me, threw shit on me.

242
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
No matter how much I suffer and complain,

243
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,720
no one would listen to me.

244
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,760
I'm telling you now.

245
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
I am done with this mutual aid club.

246
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,240
Liu Mei, you are siding with an outsider now.

247
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,760
If this is your attitude,

248
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,760
our mutual aid society will expel you today.

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Whatever!

250
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't care anymore.

251
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
Yi Qunxian, let me tell you.

252
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,040
Don't take yourself too seriously cause your father is a congressman.

253
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,760
How about that?

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
I never like you!

255
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
Are you crazy, Liu Mei?

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
You really are like a rat shit.

257
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
A rat shit that ruins a whole pot of good porridge!

258
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,760
You call me a rat shit?

259
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
What about you?

260
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,480
Your escape from marriage failed.

261
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
Better go home before you lose the chance to marry forever!

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,960
Take a good look at yourself!

263
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,160
So what if I can't get married?

264
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,960
Comrades!

265
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,920
Don't argue over me.

266
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,080
To be honest, I do care

267
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,520
about this mutual aid society.

268
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
I- I especially hope that our mutual aid society

269
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
is like a seed,

270
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
after being moistened by rain and bathed by sunshine,

271
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,200
slowly growing into a towering tree.

272
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,280
I especially hope that our mutual aid society

273
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
will be able to flourish.

274
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
So how could I possibly write this-

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
this kind of lousy article.

276
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,800
No need to explain to them, Mr. Zhang.

277
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,400
The people in their mutual aid society are single minded.

278
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,880
They are stubborn.

279
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,840
They won't listen to people.

280
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm telling you it's dark.

281
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
Really dark stuff in there.

282
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,760
I could spend three days and three nights talking about it

283
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
and even that wouldn't be enough.

284
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Let's walk,

285
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,080
we can find a cafe or a teahouse or something.

286
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,120
I will tell you everything.

287
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,120
I want to peel off their disguise layer by layer.

288
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,240
Let's go.

289
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,440
You traitor!

290
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
I am gonna bite you to death today!

291
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,440
Qunxian!

292
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Come back here!

293
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,280
Liu Mei!

294
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
I am gonna bite you to death today!

295
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,000
Come back!

296
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
Liu Mei, you're getting out of line.

297
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
So this is Liu Mei playing it by ear?

298
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,560
Well played.

299
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
She really pissed me off.

300
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,360
If he hadn't just stopped me,

301
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,400
I would've biten her already.

302
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,080
That was convincible enough, right?

303
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,800
No, no.

304
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,280
Wonderful work.

305
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
But Liu Mei is going alone now.

306
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
I am worried that Cairen might set up a trap again.

307
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
You know him? Chen Yannian?

308
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
He's Chen Duxiu's eldest son.

309
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
He tricked me into the club using sweet words.

310
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,400
If we don't take him and his father down

311
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
and expose their behaviors to the world,

312
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,960
I, Liu Mei, will die with my eyes wide open.

313
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
In that case,

314
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
I can help you.

315
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,640
Really?

316
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
Don't underestimate me.

317
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,760
I will tell you what's going on here.

318
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,280
We have been planning something big.

319
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,840
Get close.

320
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,440
My second uncle has submitted to Congress

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
a motion to impeach Cai Yuanpei, President of Peking University.

322
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
Who is your second uncle?

323
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,800
His name is Zhang Changli.

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,960
Congressman.

325
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,520
That's the same as Yi Qunxian's father.

326
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,920
Isn't it?

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,560
Exactly.

328
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
And we are working with Yi Kuilong too.

329
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
The proposal is co-signed

330
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
by the group of us.

331
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,280
This time, we must take Chen Duxiu and his gang,

332
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
tear up the altar,

333
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
and pull Chen Duxiu and the rest off the altar.

334
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
One proposal won't be enough, dont you think?

335
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
Submitting it to the Congress

336
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,400
is only our first step.

337
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
As for the second step,

338
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
we also contacted a number of

339
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,280
domestic and foreign media reporters.

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,840
Look, they are all with us.

341
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,040
A list of journalists.

342
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,240
Enough from me,

343
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
It's your turn to give me some information.

344
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,160
Let's do it.

345
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
Shen.

346
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,880
These seven articles have similar themes,

347
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,920
written neatly.

348
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,640
Take a look,

349
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
is it suitable for your column?

350
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,560
Okay.

351
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,360
Hurry up and read them through.

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,960
This Chen Zhongfu...

353
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,960
Didn't we say it clearly that day?

354
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,640
He's in charge of New Youth.

355
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
But now he is never here.

356
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
So many articles!

357
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,920
How can two people finish reading them all?

[Gao Yihan, Professor at Peking University]

359
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
Zhongfu is as busy as a bee right now.

360
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
Tons of responsibilities

361
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
on his shoulder alone.

362
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,840
Just heard that "The Renaissance" office was being attacked

363
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,560
and besieged by people.

364
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,840
He hurried to relieve it.

365
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,240
You two have worked hard.

366
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,280
Here we come.

367
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,360
We are here.

368
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,680
Here we come.

369
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
Drop off the manuscript again.

370
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm exhausted, you guys.

How many manuscripts have you received?

Not counted yet.

390

They each wrote several articles.

391
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,560
Plus the others.

392
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,960
In Anhui dialect, this is called a silt.

393
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,560
What do you mean by silt?

394

I think this Tang Erhe guy

409

isn't a good person.

410
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Indeed.

411
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
He seems to pick on Zhongfu a lot recently.

412

It's not him targeting Zhongfu.

413
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
It's Zhongfu who has gone too far recently.

414

Brother Yimo, I don't like the sound of that.

415

I think where you stand is not the right side.

Fu Zengxiang called Mr. Cai again

427
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
and asked him to go to the Ministry of Education.

428
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,360

00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,920
I have withdrawn that novel.

559
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:02,960
Withdrawn?

560
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,520
Fengzai.

561
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,560
Wasn't Fengzai here just now?

562
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,040
Teacher!

563
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,840
Fengzhun went to work-study mutual aid society again.

564
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,080
Trying to break them.

565
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
Above is the investigation of Zhang Fengzai

566
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
from our work-study mutual aid society.

567
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:29,087
[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

568
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,280
Yannian.

569
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
What do you have in mind?

570
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,080
We were thinking,

571
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,520
to first of all, keep our heads low.

572
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
We must expose this plot

573
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,960
in the congressional debate next week.

574
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,000
It'll be better if we could convince Yi Qunxian's father

575
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
that he can side with us.

576
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,560
Other than that,

577
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
we can tail Zhang Fengzai.

578
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,280
See if we can find evidence.

579
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,800
Evidence that he bought off those journalists

580
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,480
and then make it public.

581
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,240
Qunxian

582
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,160
Are you sure you can convince your father?

583
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
We can't do it alone.

584
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,640
Mr. Shouchang, do you know Mr. Zhang Shizhao?

585
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
He used to be my dad's boss.

586
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
If he is willing to come forward,

587
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
there may be a turnaround.

588
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,080
No problem.

589
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
Mr. Xingyan happens to be in Beijing.

590
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,360
I can take you to him.

591
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,480
Good.

592
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,520
Have you found out any of the reporters?

593
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
I glanced at the list.

594
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,400
There is an English journalist Edward

595
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,560
and Japanese journalist Sato Tetjiro.

596
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
Okay, let's start with these two.

597
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,480
Mr. Shouchang.

598
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Mr. Cai asked you to hurry to the principal's office.

599
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,800
Said there was something important to discuss.

600
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,840
Take a seat.

601
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,384
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Dean of Liberal Arts at Peking University]

602
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,440
I'm sorry, Mr Cai.

603
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,240
I'm late.

604
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
Mr. Shouchang, please sit down.

605
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:49,840
Yes.

606
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,120
What's going on?

607
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,160
Lin Shu asked Zhang Shizhao sent me a message the day before yesterday.

608
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
Said that he had already pull back

609
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
his second novel.

610
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,960
But yesterday,

611
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,040
he published an open letter to me.

612
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,320
Today,

613
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
a novel came out.

614
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,240
A novel called "Yao Meng"

615
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
Yucai, you are a novelist.

616
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
You shall be the one to have a better look at this

617
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,560
This "Yao Meng"

618
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,997
[Lu Xun, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

619
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
"Yao Meng".

620
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,160
"Yao Meng" is about

621
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,560
a man named Zheng Sikang

622
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,040
sleepwalking to the underworld.

623
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,840
He saw a place

624
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,320
called a simple words school.

625
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
The school is full of little devil-like beings.

626
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
There is a pair of couplets in the hall.

627
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
The top line says: how incredible

628
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,440
"Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Water Margin" is in the vernacular?

629
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
The bottom line says: traditional writings have lost their charm,

630
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,880
who are Ou Yangxiu and Han Yu?

631
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,000
There is also a hall called "End of Confucius" in the school.

632
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,840
Also there is the couplet:

633
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,880
animals are truely free, with no bounds from morality,

634
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,000
being noble is troublesome, all the better to discard it.

635
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Yuan Xu, the headmaster of the school,

636
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
is whom Zhu Xi mentioned in the "Analects" of Confucius

637
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
called Cai Dagui.

638
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
This obviously refers to Mr. Cai.

639
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,240
Dean Tian Heng,

640
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,000
Deputy Provost Qin Ershi,

641
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
also allude to brother Zhongfu and Shizhi respectively.

642
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,920
These creatures described in the novel

643
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
take a strong stand on bring the end to Confucious,

644
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,280
promoting simple words,

645
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,640
shouting about the abolition of ancient Chinese literature.

646
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,520
What happened after is

647
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
they angered Asura, king of the underworld.

648
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,040
In a fit of anger,

649
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,320
Asura ate them all

650
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
and turned them into smelly feces.

651
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,920
Yucai, I didn't hear you clearly.

652
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,760
Was it that they ate us

653
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
or they ate the smelly feces?

654
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,200
Eat us up

655
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,280
then turn into smelly feces.

656
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,880
I thought they had a feces feast.

657
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
Zhongfu, don't make fun of it at this time.

658
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
It should be said that Lin Shu's novel is very repulsive.

659
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,880
But, I think what's worse

660
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,680
is this article in the "Gazette" newspaper:

661
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
"The recent changes of Peking University's ideological trend".

662
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,320
This article is completely

663
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,000
full of the tone of a politician.

664
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,240
It says

665
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,720
that ever since Cai Yuanpei took charge of Peking University,

666
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
he has hired the wrong people,

667
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,160
and the corruption of scholars' habits is obvious to all.

668
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,160
Professor Chen Duxiu of Peking University

669
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
regards himself as the leader of the new school.

670
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,360
Among the teachers,

671
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,000
it's not only Chen Duxiu that is complicit,

672
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,680
there is also Hu Shi, Li Dazhao, Qian Xuantong,

673
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,680
Liu Bannong, Gao Yihan, and more.

674
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Students follow blindly.

675
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
There is no shortage of exaggeration.

676
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
And the article also said

677
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
the new trend of thought in Peking University

678
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,600
has caused public resentment.

679
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,920
The Ministry of Education has ordered Peking University

680
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,720
that Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, and Qian Xuantong

681
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,760
are to be expelled.

682
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,160
Ah, this.

683
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,680
I was on my way here just now

684
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,720
and bought the "Shenzhou Daily" newspaper.

685
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,040
The "Bangu Lu Xun" column said

686
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi,

687
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,360
Tao Menghe, Liu Bannong, and others

688
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,360
are already subject to government involvement.

689
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,000
It said Chen Duxiu had a pessmistic attitude

690
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
and has left Peking University.

691
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,040
They are not letting this just settle down.

692
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,800
I've already put up with it again and again.

693
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,960
However, these people are pushing even harder.

694
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,680
Heavy clouds upon a city can be stressful.

695
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,800
But the sun will always come out and tear the darkness apart.

696
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
Then let me, this so-called Cai Dagui,

697
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,480
go into battle and fight.

698
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,640
Great, Master Cai.

699
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,840
Even though I'm a smelly shit,

700
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,600
I won't bend.

701
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
This pen in my hand can sweep a thousand troops.

702
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
We will keep going.

703
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,520
In his poem "The Song of the Stormy Petrel",

704
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,800
Russian writer Gorky wrote

705
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
this one line

706
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,760
"Let the tempest come strike harder!".

707
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,920
Recently,

708
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Lin Shu, who claimed to be a Qing imperial scholar had a big talk.

709
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,080
Claiming

710
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,720
to guard the code of education and ethics of the Republic of China.

711
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Of course, he can say whatever he wants.

712
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,640
Nothing to do with me.

713
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
But look at his impetuous behaviour.

714
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
I again feel pity.

715
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,200
I can't help but try to persuade him.

716
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,200
I want to discuss with you all how I can persuade you.

717
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,800
Since you regard yourself an old scholar of the imperial Qing,

718
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,440
then you should not care about the matters of the Republic of China.

719
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,560
Worrying less is good for you.

720
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,360
After the war, we see how right triumphs over might.

721
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
Did you?

722
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,880
A person who claims loyalty to the imperial Qing

723
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
came to the Republic of China,

724
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
let a man named Zheng Sikang

725
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,040
to sleepwalk to the underworld,

726
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,240
seeing creatures roaming in the simple word school

727
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,080
that's putting an end to Confucius,

728
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
advocating the vernacular,

729
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,800
promoting the abolition of classical Chinese.

730
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,920
As a result,

731
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,400
he provoked King Asura and had them all eaten.

732
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,200
After the anger,

733
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,240
not only that,

734
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
he even turned them into smelly feces.

735
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,800
So I thought,

736
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,840
that no one

737
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,000
shall try to stop the wheel of history.

738
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
You need to obstruct it!

739
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,320
Then what is

740
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,760
the only outcome?

741
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,760
It shall run over your legs!

742
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:28,720
Hurrah! Hurrah!

743
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm telling those stubborn ghosts from old times,

744
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
people with outdated minds.

745
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
You should stick to your principles

746
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,640
and stand up openly

747
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,040
to discuss with us, the new school of thought, in an open and honest manner.

748
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,640
If you want to hide behind others,

749
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,920
counting on them to cover you,

750
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,440
and put it in violence towards

those who oppose you

753
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,040
so you can feel better

754
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,760
or even write a nonsense novel

755
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,120
to relax yourself

756
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,840
and make up a rumor and be relieved,

757
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,880
then it's an utterly boring move!

758
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,280
You must know that in today's China,

759
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,080
if the youth are truly awakened,

760
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
then they are not afraid

761
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,640
of your devastation.

762
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,560
You, who claimed to be the noble man,

763
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,040
can also never destroy the spirit of these young people.

764
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,920
Even back then, the tyrannical Russia

765
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
has killed countless aspiring young people

766
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,280
with extreme cruelty.

[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

Who would know, it is their blood

00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,120
that eventually

770
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,400
cultivates the flower of revolutionary freedom.

771
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,640
Those black prison cells

772
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,760
instead, became the place for aspiring young fighters to rest

773
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,880
after they won the great battle.

774
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,040
The oppression of the tyrannical government,

775
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
in turn, provided some interest,

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,600
for us revolutionaries.

we advocate a new culture

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
to seek liberation in all aspects:

785
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,320
the liberation of the mind,

786
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,360
the liberation of politics,

787
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
the liberation of the economy, the liberation of men and women,

788
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,480
and the liberation of education.

789
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
All have to rise above from the hell beneath

790
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,120
and see the broad daylight.

Our Chinese nation

is born with the greatest ability.

793
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
The deeper the oppression,

794
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
the greater the resistance.

795
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,040
the more a spring is pressed,

the faster it bounces back

I dare to say this:

798
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,920
one day,

799
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,920
the reform of the Chinese nation

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
than all the others.

Fellow citizens,

806
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
we shall work hard

807
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,240

Zhang Fengzai, what on earth is going on?

814
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,360
You promised me again and again that you would withdraw the manuscript.

815
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,000
Why is it published now?

816
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
Explain it to me.

817
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,960
Sir,

818
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,560
I did convey it to the newspaper.

819
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
Your request to withdraw the manuscript

820
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,280
and they agreed.

821
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,640
I don't know.

822
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
What went wrong?

823
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,080
Zhang Fengzai, you are no longer my student.

824
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,320
You put me in this difficult situation

825
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,440
and hade me an ungrateful oathbreaker.

826
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,840
Now how can I face Mr. Cai, face the public?

827
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,880
Sir, I have sent a letter to Cai Yuanpei

828
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,320
to explain all this.

829
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
I will take all the responsibility.

830
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
Will Cai Yuanpei accept to your explanation?

831
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,760
Can you even carry a responsibility this heavy?

832
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,320
You're a traitor.

Teacher, let's calm down.

835
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080

We are not on the same path.

843
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
Now leave.

844
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,840
I never want to see you again.

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,960
I will leave now.

Come and read the newspapers!

Cai Yuanpei responded to Lin Qinnan.

858
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
Rewned discussion on the proposition of New Culture!

859
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,560
See how Chen Duxiu face the rumors about Peking University!

860
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,400
Li Dazhao on the fierce battle between the old and new thoughts!

00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,960
Tell everyone about their tasks tonight.

869
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,680
Alright.

870
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
Let me explain it first.

871
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
This action is forbidden to record.

872

The first group:

00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
He Mengxiong and Shi Cuntong,

876
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,880
you two are responsible for escorting Yi Qunxian

877
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,560
to meet Congressman Yi Kuilong.

878
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,320
You are to convince Yi Kuilong

879
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,840
so he will cancel the joint proposal with Zhang Changli

880
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,520
and pull off the impeachment of Education Minister Fu Zengxiang

881
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,040
and Peking University President Cai Yuanpei.

882
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,400
Also, he will not talk in the court.

883
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,800
But what if my dad doesn't want to see us?

884
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,920
Mr. Li Dazhao said

885
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,560
Mr. Zhang Shizhao

886
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,600
already called your father.

887
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,040

888
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,000
in addition to handing over

889

Mr. Zhang Shizhao's letter.

890
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,400
More important

891
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,920
is convincing Yi Kuilong

892
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,120
to work with us.

893
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,480
Whether your task is a success or not

894
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
is the key to our whole mission that day.

895
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,280
Clear.

896
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,080

Chen Yannian and Liu Mei,

899
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,800
you go find that journalist

900
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,000
Edward, from the "The Times",

901
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,600
to expose Zhang Fengzai's plot

902
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,440
and win his support.

903
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,000
Clear.

904
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,880
The third group:

905
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,240
comrades of the screening group,

906
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,480
you go find Japanese journalist Sato Tetsujiro,

907
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,920
same task as the second group.

908
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,640

The fourth group:

Guo Xingang and Liu Haiwei,

911
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,840
you are both students of Peking University.

912
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,880
It's better you stay away from the public's eye,

913
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
so you two and Bai Lan will collect and sort out related information

914
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,480
to print out

915
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,440
that we can use later.

916

Clear.

917

Task assignment is complete.

918
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,320
Everyone feeling confident?

919
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,960
Yes!

920
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,760
Let's go!

921
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,320
Understood!

922
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,480
Uncle, I don't know what happened these two days.

923
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,480
I have this bad feeling.

924
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,920
What's going on?

925
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,040
You sent that letter to Cai Yuanpei?

926
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,360
It's been several days.

927
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
Nothing happened since.

928
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,120
What does the letter say?

929
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,480
I said I was a student in Peking University

930
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
and also a reporter working with several different papers.

931
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,840
Lin Shu was my teacher in Wuchang Middle School.

932
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,200
He taught me.

933
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,440
I refered his two novels

934
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,240
to the "New Morning Post"

935
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
and the "Shenzhou Daily".

936
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,240
Lin Shu did ask me to

937
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,920
withdraw "Yao Meng".

938
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
But by that time they have already printed it.

939
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
It didn't go as he wanted.

940
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
This responsibility should be borne by me.

941
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,840
But I think,

942
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,520
Lin Shu's two novels

943
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,280
are truly of the best of literature.

944
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,200
Peking University should have a bigger heart

945
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,720
and publish them in school.

946
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,160
Silly boy.

947
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,560
Didn't you add fuel to Cai Yuanpei's fire?

948
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,160
Now he won't spare you.

949
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,000
That's exactly what I want.

950
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,720
The moment he's onto me, all his so-called free thoughts

951
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,200
and compatibility will be blown away.

952
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,320
You are a moth to a flame.

953
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Ok, you have guts.

954
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,600
By the way,

955
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,240
I called Wu Bingxiang.

956
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,000
As soon as you graduate from university

957
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,800
go to the metropolitan police department to take office.

958
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,400
You can pick any title you want.

959
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,120
I won't dissapoint you

960
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,040
as a university law student.

961
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,960
Uncle, actually, I do want to stay in Peking University.

962
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,880
They always say,

963
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,520
in the past, Peking University had a lot of money and people were stupid.

964
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
It's easy to make a living and win some fame.

965
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,560
Did you learn nothing all these years?

966
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
Nothing at all?

967
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,160
Your mind is full of gunk.

968
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,800
You are exactly the kind that Chen Duxiu and Lu Xun talks about.

969
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,960
A sanctimonious person.

970
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,160
Rogue under a mask of scholar,

971
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,560
and does bad things in the name of academic justice.

972
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
This is you right here.

973
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,360
Well, I learnt it all from you.

974
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,120
A gentleman shall be like orchid.

975
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,560
You should know yourself better.

976
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll do it.

977
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,080
Need me to move a heavy pot after all.

978
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Uncle, stop talking about me.

979
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
How's it going for you to go to Congress the day after tomorrow?

980
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,640
The proposal was handed in early.

981
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,560
Yi Kuilong will take the lead.

982
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,440
He will explain the proposal the day after tomorrow.

983
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,600
So I can hide behind the scenes and watch.

984
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,760
I see, stay out of the mess.

985
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,920
Do you think their proposal can be passed?

986
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
No way.

987
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,040
To pass a motion,

988
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,760
two thirds of the votes are required.

989
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,640
Most members of Congress

990
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,560
agree or sympathize with the New Culture Movement.

991
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,200
There are many friends of Cai Yuanpei too

992
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,400
It's impossible they will pass the proposal.

993
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,040
We planned all this.

994
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,960
It's only a show to disgust

995
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,960
Cai Yuanpei and Chen Duxiu.

996
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,080
Shaking public opinion a bit is the bonus

997
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,920
along with putting more pressure on the government.

998
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,680
That's all.

999
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,960
By the way, the most important thing is journalists.

1000
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,840
The congressmen plus the audience that day

1001
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
won't make a big number.

1002
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,360
Without the posture of a large number of journalists,

1003
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,360
this show will fail

1004
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
Rest assured.

1005
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
I've arranged everything.

1006
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,160
Nothing that money can't resolve

1007
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,320
Is the manuscript ready?

1008
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,040
You can trust me.

1009
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,240
Be cautious.

1010
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Caution is the parent of safety.

1011
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,120
Understood.
