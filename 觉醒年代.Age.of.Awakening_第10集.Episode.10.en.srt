00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,720


704
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,160


705
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640


706
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,680


707
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,920


708
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,720


709
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,680


710
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,640


711
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,600


712
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,920
Besides, I don't want to go back to that lousy temple.

713
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,760
You should go back to that lousy temple!

714
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,800
How unusual for the two of you to come to me

715
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,440
full of disapproval and complaint.

716
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,240
Alright. How have you been wronged?

717
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,240
I, Yuanpei, will make it right for you.

718
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,680
Mr. Cai, if I may ask,

719
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
how was the list of committee members

720
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,400
on the school appraisal council produced?

721
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,400
Ah, so it is this matter.

722
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
I will explain.

723
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,920
After the Zhang Xun restoration incident,

724
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,760
I was requested by the ministry of education

725
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,920
to readjust the school appraisal committee membership

726
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,880
[Gu Hongming, styled Tang Sheng, Peking University professor]
based on fluctuations in the number of qualified teaching staff.

727
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
So based on the ministry's request

728
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,240
the school council, after much deliberation,

729
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
have now put together a list of candidates

730
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,800
for public feedback.

731
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,520
I suppose you both have already seen it.

732
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,960
What do you think? Please speak your mind.

733
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,040
I recall Mr. Cai once stated

734
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,560
academic performance

735
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,440
shall be the basis of professorial appointments at Peking University.

736
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,320
In light of this standard, we both believe

737
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,480
there is a high proportion of chaff on the

738
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,720
proposed list of candidates for the appraisal committee.

739
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,760
Master Cai, such an appraisal committee

740
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,160
would destroy the reputation of Peking University.

741
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,760
Mr. Huang Kan, please elaborate.

742
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,840
What sort of person is that Hu Shi?

743
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,560
He is merely a student who has just graduated.

744
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,000
Peking University is China's highest institution of learning.

745
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,880
How could it possibly

746
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
need a youth who can only sing a few farfetched nursery rhymes

747
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
on the appraisal committee?

748
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Master Cai, allow me to be blunt.

749
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,280
If all Hu Shi needs to do is say a few words of vernacular Chinese,

750
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,640
speak a few foreign words

751
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,160
to become a professor, become a member of the appraisal committee,

752
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,400
then let's not bother calling our Peking University as such any longer.

753
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,360
It might as well be the University of Vernacular Chinese.

754
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,000
That's right.

755
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,600
Hu Shi

756
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,160
is an outstanding student from Columbia University.

757
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,760
A young talent recommended 

758
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,240
to Peking University from overseas.

759
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,160
Though he is young,

760
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,000
he has published extensively

761
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,240
and has impeccable academic credentials.

762
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,040
Amongst the younger students, he is very influential.

763
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,840
So to choose him for the appraisal committee

764
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
also boosts the moral of the younger students. 

765
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
So that reforms will more strongly take root.

766
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Master Cai, I myself studied abroad as a youth in England,

767
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,000
I was awarded a Master's degree in literature from the University of Edinburgh at the age of twenty.

768
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,160
I am proficient in nine foreign languages.

769
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
If I'm not even qualified to be

770
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,040
an appraisal committee member,

771
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,880
then how could Hu Shi, newly returned and without any achievements,

772
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,440
possibly deserve his position?

773
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,560
It is true that you are world renowned.

774
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,360
But you abetted the Zhang Xun restoration,

775
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,240
which has already aroused much popular indignation and anger.

776
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,600
Furthermore, there are many joint letters from students and teachers

777
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,360
calling for the removal of your teaching position.

778
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,160
Do you think it's appropriate

779
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,360
for you to be on the appraisal committee

780
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,960
at such a time?

781
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,160
Mr. Cai, haven't you always emphasized

782
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,160
that the most important standard at Peking University

783
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,280
is academic ability?

784
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,280
If we are judging on the basis of political orientation,

785
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,120
while I, Huang Kan, was waging revolution,

786
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
what was Hu Shi even doing?

787
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,520
I really do take professional ability very seriously.

788
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
However, the country has certain stipulations.

789
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,280
This reselection of appraisal committee members

790
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,120
must abide by the clear cut policies set by the Ministry of Education.

791
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,720
One of which is that the appraisal committee members

792
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
in terms of politics, must support republicanism.

793
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,080
Another, that teachers must have favourable personal attributes.

794
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,440
A third, that must be representatives from 
different administrative levels , and so on.

795
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,000
Which is why you two experts were not chosen.

796
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,680
I probably don't need to list

797
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,560
the specific reasons one by one.

798
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,160
I know the two of you are somewhat prejudiced

799
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,840
against Hu Shi.

800
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,120
To be quite honest, I had the same impression.

801
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,840
But after I met Hu Shi,

802
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,440
and conversed with him,

803
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,520
his reasoning and his views

804
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,400
dispelled my misgivings.

805
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,280
Hu Shi is, after all,

806
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,280
a representative of new culture.

807
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,200
Besides, Hu Shi is a brilliant student

808
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
of the American master of pragmatism, John Dewey.

809
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,120
It has extensive influence

810
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,960
amongst many students.

811
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,360
I am planning to ask Hu Shi

812
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,800
to prepare a lecture for us at Peking University.

813
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
I invite both experts to attend.

814
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
The level of his abilities

815
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,400
will be clear upon listening.

816
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,240
Alright. When the time comes I will be certain to sing his praises.

817
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,520
Great.

818
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,520
Mind your step.

819
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,040
Come over here.

820
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,960
Hurry and find Mr. Hu Shi.

821
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,480
Tell him to see me.

822
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
I have to talk to him.

823
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,040
Alright.

824
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,120
Please sit.

825
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Esteemed collegues,

826
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,120
Zhang Xun does his restoration and Peking University is rocked by an earthquake.

827
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,920
For over three months

828
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
my students at Peking University

829
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,560
was unable to focus on learning, on studying.

830
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,560
For over three months

831
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,080
my teaching staff at Peking University

832
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,520
was unable to use their energy on teaching, on giving classes.

833
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,760
For over three months

834
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,520
my collegues at Peking University

835
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,480
were unable to pursue their studies in peace.

836
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,520
The very thought of it causes grief.

837
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,080
Some have asked me, with all this turmoil,

838
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,400
what is Peking University to do?

839
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,120
What is the fate of new culture?

840
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,160
Today, we've finally re-opened the school.

841
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,880
On the occasional of today's opening ceremony,

842
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,000
I have eight words for everyone present.

843
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,720
Our original intent is immovable, our commitment unwavering.

844
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,160
A few days ago, Dr. Hu Shi came to Peking Univerity.

845
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,360
He gave me an essay

846
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,200
that he published when he was in the United States.

847
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,400
Its title is "Against Studying Abroad."

848
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,920
Its topic is on the question

849
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
of how universities pursue knowledge.

850
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,240
I was very stimulated by reading it.

851
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,120
Therefore, I've changed things up

852
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,640
for today's opening ceremony.

853
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,800
I've invited Dr. Hu Shi

854
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
to give us a lecture.

855
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,040
Its title is

856
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,880
"The Relationship Between The University and Chinese Higher Learning"

857
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,080
We invite Dr. Hu Shi to come onstage.

858
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,240
You shall know the difference

859
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,960
now that we are back again.

860
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,560
This is a quote

861
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,320
from the epics of Homer.

862
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,960
It means "Now that we are back again

863
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,960
you shall know the difference."

864
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,480
What? What does this mean?

865
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,200
I believe that these words also represent

866
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,240
what every scholar at Peking University feels at this very moment.

867
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,520
A noble king ought also listen to the opinions of others

868
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,120
and proceed with caution.

869
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,480
I give you a piece of advice.

870
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,160
Do not forget it.

871
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,000
I'd like to ask Dr. Hu Shi what I've just said.

872
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,800
Apologies, sir.

873
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,560
I truly do not understand what you said.

874
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,920
I just recited Homer

875
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,240
in the original Greek.

876
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,520
The meaning in Chinese is

877
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,000
A noble king ought also listen to the opinions of others

878
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
and proceed with caution.

879
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
I give you a piece of advice.

880
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,880
Do not forget it.

881
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,880
It is forgivable

882
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,680
that Dr. Hu Shi doesn't understand Greek

883
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
and recites Ancient Greek poetry in English.

884
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,400
But if ancient Greek poetry is to be recited in English

885
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,720
it ought to be the pure English

886
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
of a London gentleman.

887
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,920
Your pronunciation is far too inept.

888
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,800
Entirely that of a commoner.

889
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,280
A proper London gentleman sounds like this.

890
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,080
You shall know the difference

891
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
now that we are back again.

892
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,720
Ok?

893
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,920
Wonderful!

894
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,200
This must be

895
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,360
the illustrious Mr. Gu Hongming.

896
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,840
To have received your instruction at our first meeting

897
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
is a great honour.

898
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,320
I am vey thankful for Mr. Gu's correction

899
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,880
of my English pronunciation.

900
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,560
But today

901
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,800
I use this quote from Homer

902
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
without regard for its language, its pronunciation, its tone.

903
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
I don't care whether it is said

904
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,080
in proper London English

905
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,920
or with the pronunciation of a commoner.

906
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,280
What I care about is

907
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
the meaning it conveys.

908
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Now that we are back,

909
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,440
you shall know the difference.

910
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,360
This statement is also what I wish to deliver to you.

911
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,120
This statement...

912
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
is what I wish to deliver to everyone sitting here as well.

913
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,720
This is a statement from us at Peking University

914
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,400
towards an outdated China.

915
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,600
A manifesto aimed at an outdated culture.

916
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,120
And it is also a solemn statement of commitment

917
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,520
to the successful future of Peking University!
