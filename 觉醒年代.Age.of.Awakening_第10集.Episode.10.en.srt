Mr. Zhongfu.

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
I am here to discuss with you,

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,280
matters involving the children.

58
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,080
Now the country is facing internal strife.

59
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,120
Because of Zhang Xun's restoration, classes have stopped.

60
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Even if we resume classes,

61
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,760
it will be during the next semester.

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
Countless wars are happening overseas.

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
So they want to go to France to work and study.

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm afraid we can't provide a schedule at such short notice.

65
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,360
Mr. Liu, what do you intend to do then?

66
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,200
I do not want to disrupt our children's futures,

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
so I was thinking if both our families can work together

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,440
and send the three of them to America to study.

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,960
I'll handle the paperwork

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
and expenses.

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,480
Mr. Liu,

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,520
this is already the second time you have brought this up.

73
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,840
I appreciate your concern

74
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
and understand your feelings,

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,520
but I will tell you frankly

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
I cannot agree to this.

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
All these things.

78
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,600
I think Mr. Zhongfu

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,040
has prepared for Yannian and Qiaonian right?

80
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,480
Yes indeed.

81
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,800
Parents want the best for their children.

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,960
Mr. Zhongfu, Liu Mei is my only daughter,

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
so I understand how you feel.

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,960
I can really understand

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,080
a father's love for his children.

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,920
But Mr. Zhongfu,

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
regarding this matter,

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
why are you so steadfast in your choice?

89
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,080
Mr. Liu, please do not misunderstand.

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm not being steadfast.

91
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,440
Firstly, I'm not able to decide on Yannian's behalf.

92
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Secondly, Yannian

93
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,680
will never accept

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,640
others' help.

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,160
Let me tell you honestly,

96
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm worried about his attitude

97
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,320
because Yannian

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,160
is too disciplined and confident.

99
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,080
I am not able to convince him.

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,435
I feel extremely guilty

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
that, as his father,

102
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,840
I have no right to speak.

103
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
Mr. Zhongfu,

104
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
the two children

105
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,200
are already in a relationship,

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,480
so I feel that,

107
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
as elders,

108
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
we should care about their future.

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,000
This is an issue.

110
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,680
The two children

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,280
are in what kind of relationship?

112
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,320
They--

113
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm not sure if I can explain it clearly.

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,640
I understand

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,160
Mr. Liu, how about this.

116
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,080
I'll talk to him.

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,520
We need to establish the facts first,

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
so we don't make any mistakes.

119
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,840
Let me handle it.

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,920
After I get an answer,

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
we'll speak again.

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Thank you so much.

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
You're too gracious.

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll take my leave first.

125
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
Why don't you stay for a meal.

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
No, no, no.

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
I know you haven't finished your previous discussion.

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
No need to send me off.

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,920
Alright, take your time.

130
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll wait for your response.

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,880
Alright.

132

Baisha!

133
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
On the day of Zhang Xun's restoration,

134
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,280
Li Dazhao was forced to leave Beijing.

135
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
For several months, he was exiled in Jiangnan

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
and fell to the lowest rungs of society

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,680
to observe national sentiments

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
and to clear his thoughts,

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
desperately finding a way to save his country.

140
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
The Zhang Xun Restoration

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
signaled that

142
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,120
the plan for the establishment of a bourgeois republic in China

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,240
failed completely.

144

[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang]

146
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,080
hastened the reform of the bourgeois

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
and caused a change in perception and criticism.

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,760
The modern Chinese

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,640
started to realize

150
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,560
that simply relying on transplanting

151
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,400
Western political ideology and methods

152
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,680
cannot save China.

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Saving China would require starting from the basics.

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,320
Apart from a cultural awakening

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,120
and enlightenment,

156
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
listening to the voices of the people is crucial

157
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,080
to find a suitable solution to reform China.

158
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,720
Come here.

Uncle Wang!

162
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,120
My father wouldn't have left right?

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
No, he wouldn't have

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
He would not have left before seeing the both of you.

[Chen Yannian, Chen Duxiu's eldest son]

166
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Even if he had left, he wouldn't have gone far.

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
Would he have gone to Jixi

168
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,720
to see Hu Shi?

169
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
I told you we shouldn't have come.

170
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,040
Qiaonian, let's go.

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,560
Older brother!

Yannian!

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
These are the buns your aunt steamed.

174
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
I was afraid it would spoil in the hot weather so I heated it up again.

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,720
Come.

176
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
Yannian, come.

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
Listen to Uncle.

178
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
Come.

179
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
Sit here.

180

Sit.

181
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,160
Look.

182
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,960
I told you he hasn't left yet.

183
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
He went to steam buns for you.

184
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,480
Yesterday,

185
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,680
your father said

186
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
to send these buns to school.

187
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Gao Junman helped me to steam it.

188
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,880
She told me to eat it while travelling.

189
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,120
It's quite a lot, so help yourself.

191

It's meat.

192

Didn't you say it was meant for you.

195
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,160
There are two different fillings,

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,120
vegetarian and meat.

197
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
I've finished the vegetarian filling.

198
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,600
The meat filling is for you.

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,760
Can you stop pretending?

200
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Since when was there vegetarian fillings?

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
Why do I not know about them?

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,600
You have eaten them.

204

208

and you had to lie about vegetarian fillings.

209
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
Stop pretending.

210
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
Speak honestly.

211
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,160
I've finally managed to see you this time.

212
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,800
So let's chat.

213
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,520
Let's chat about two things.

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Firstly, the both of you have come out

215
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
to see the world at such a young age.

216
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,600
Makes me relieved to see the both of you so self-reliant.

217
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
You want to go to France to work and study.

218
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
I am supportive as well.

219
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
But now there is a world war going on.

220
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
The plan of staying in France is still far away.

221
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,160
Our country is also experiencing internal strife.

222
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
You can't always remain

223
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,200
at this French language centre.

224
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,120
If you do not have a long term plan, you will definitely have worries.

225
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,800
I want to know

226
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,400
what your thoughts are.

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
Both of us will walk this path alone.

228
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,000
We won't rely on others and our family.

229
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
To us, work-study

230
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
is the most appropriate path.

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
We plan to study in France.

232
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,720
We have a very strong foundation now,

233
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
we will not give up halfway.

234
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
So we have decided to remain in Shanghai to study.

235
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,520
Yadong Library's business is doing well.

236
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
We should be able to work-study with no issues.

237
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,280
Most importantly we have many books to read here.

238
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,640
We can't bear to leave.

239
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,360
That's right.

240
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
We can go to Beijing during the holidays.

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,560
Alright, since you have already thought hard about it,

242
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,640
I will respect your wishes.

243
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,480
Secondly,

244
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,000
can you tell me

245
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,360
what your relationship is with Liu Mei?

246
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,560
What do you mean?

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't you think that

248
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
everyone is curious about it?

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm not surprised that people are curious.

250
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
I did not expect you to be curious about it as well.

251
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,000
Why not?

252
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,040
Because I feel that you

253
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
are not such a superficial person.

254
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,520
Is it superficial for me to be concerned about you and Liu Mei?

255
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Since you are as superficial as everyone else,

256
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
I will tell you clearly

257
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,960
that I, Liu Mei and Qiaonian

258
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,440
have a pure and noble relationship

259
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,800
based on mutual cooperation.

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
I don't quite understand.

261
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,280
Have you read Kropotkin's

262
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
and Tolstoy's books?

263
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,440
Yes I have.

264
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,960
So you must know about mutualism,

265
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,480
anarchism,

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
and pan-laborism.

267
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,800
I know a little.

268
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
So you should know about

269
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
what is mankind's ideal state.

270
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,840
I'm all ears.

271
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
Mankind's most ideal state

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
is when the whole society

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,760
continuously achieves moral self-improvement

274
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,720
through self-discipline.

275
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,160
Everyone will work together

276
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
and form a relationship that transcends familial and romantic ties.

277
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,760
Oh, so you and Liu Mei have this sort of relationship.

278
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
This is what I desire.

279
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,760
Then, other people get the impression

280
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
that you and her are a couple.

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,520
A couple?

282
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Like butterfly lovers, do you understand?

283
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
Mandarin ducks or something, you know?

284
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,160
This is the difference in our generations.

285
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,960
Your generation can't get rid of the obstacle of superficiality.

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,480
But to us,

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,160
that is our goal.

288
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,280
What we desire

289
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,200
is an eternal pure and noble friendship.

290
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,760
Does Liu Mei have the same understanding as you?

291
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Of course.

292
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,760
Additionally, I am

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
imposing a self-discipline rule on myself.

294
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,640
I call it the six prohibitions.

295
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,000
What do you mean?

296
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
They are no skiving, no watching of shows, no photography,

297
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
no eating at restaurants, no talking about fashion

298
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
but most importantly,

299
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
no dating, no private relationships.

300
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,400
If society is able to be disciplined

301
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
and continuously self-improve,

302
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,120
everyone will come together

303
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,720
to form relationships that transcend familial and romantic ties.

304
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,640
So doesn't that make me and your aunt,

305
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,160
your aunt and your Uncle Wang,

306
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,280

309

the same type of relationship?

310
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,040
That would be it.

311
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
Then why do you address your aunt as mother?

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,000
That's just a name.

313
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
So what do you call me then?

314
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
I've always called you Chen Duxiu.

315
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880

316

Alright, I'll leave, please continue eating.

319

Tell everyone what this seal means.

348

My verdict is that it is extraordinary.

The words "Beida" (=Peking University) written in seal script are written vertically.

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,960
The "Bei" at the top

352
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,440
is written such that it looks like two people with their backs facing each other.

353

This is a man carrying two people on his back,

which then symbolizes a meaning of a crowd.

357
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240

I think this is too Western.

374
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Too abstract.

375
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,200
It doesn't reflect the essence of Peking University.

376
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Peking University is the successor to the Imperial College's teachings.

377

[Liu Bannong, Professor at Peking University]

378
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,840
The ancestral hall of this university

379
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,520
is the highest institution that inherits

380
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
our Chinese cultural tradition.

381
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,680
Do you need to use

382
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
this Western conception to embody it?

383
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,040
Frivolous.

384
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
Doesn't this image exactly have Chinese characteristics?

385
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,600
Is there anything better than this?

386
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,394
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

387
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,200
This is inauspicious!

388
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,840
Alright, alright.

389
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,080
Let each express one's opinions and contend with another.

390
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
This is the ethos of Peking University.

391
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Don't always let ourselves speak.

392
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,880
Exactly.

393
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
Let the students speak too.

394
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,760
Zhongxia, come and speak.

395
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,280
Zhongxia, come.

396
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,760
Speak.

397
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
I think the seal is quite interesting.

398
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,720
Look at the arrangement of these three "people".

399
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,840
What about these two "people"?

400
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
Like two students back-to-back.

401

[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

403
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
It's like a bowing teacher.

404
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,840
The teacher is lifting the two students with his shoulders.

405
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,760
The teacher is thus willing to be a ladder.

406
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,680
The students have lofty aspirations.

407
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600

I--

419
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,240
I know you went to Shanghai to meet me.

Shizhi--

421
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
There was something at home, so I had to get back in a hurry

422
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,680
and make you come for nothing.

Shizhi, don't pay attention.

450

This is not to say that you are frivolous.

He's still sick. He's still seriously ill.

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,880
Okay, Yihan.

tidy up his room.

468
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,480
Yes, let's go.

Sit on the chair.

475
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:40,767
Sit on the chair.

476
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,520
Thank you.

477
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,320
Enjoy your meal, gentlemen.

478
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
I can't see you clearly when I sit across.

479
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,400
I've been looking forward to you for half a year.

480
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,280
I finally got my wish to see you.

481
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,240
Have you tried lamb hotpot?

482
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,960
Lamb hotpot.

483
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,640
Not used to moving places.

484
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,880
Quanjude roast duck.

485
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's go, we're going now.

486
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,200
Sir, sir.

487
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
Lamb hotpot is great. I like it.

488
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
I can't eat it overseas.

489
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,717
Like it?

490
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:48,048
I like it.

491
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
If you like it, you can sit down.

492
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,720
Sit down, sir.

493
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,880
What wine would you like to drink?

494
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,480
Erguotou.

495
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,760
Pretty good.

496
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,480
Good.

497
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Since ancient times, men have hated each other,

498
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
but they have always loved Erguotou.

499
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,720
I'll pour it for you.

500
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,520
I'll do it, sir.

501
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,880
Let me mix the seasoning for you.

502
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,000
Alright.

503
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
When eating lamb hotpot,

504
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
the seasoning comes first.

505
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,960
I only learned it after I came to Beijing.

506
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
I'll do it, sir.

507
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,480
No, no, you can't.

508
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,520
This salty taste is very particular.

509
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
Sir, that's very kind.

510
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
I, Chen Duxiu, while spending half my life wandering,

511
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
have met quite a few scholars,

512
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
but most have little reputation,

513
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
only my good brother makes me feel inferior.

514
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,040
Several passages in the article "A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform"

515
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
are like mountains and rivers.

516
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,160
It often makes me feel so relaxed and mesmerized that I forgot about all my honors and regrets.

517
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,120
And to be honest,

518
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
every time I write to you,

519
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,520
it reminds me of the Boya and Ziqi friends.

520
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
Thank you, sir.

521
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,760
Come and taste the salty flavor.

522
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
You can add sesame paste if you feel it.

523
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
When it's light, you can add chive.

524
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,680
Small bites, small bites.

525
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,209
Perfect.

526
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:34,897
Perfect.

527
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:35,840
Good.

528
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,440
Come, eat some meat.

529
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
Sir.

530
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Would you like some?

531
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,280
Give me some.

532
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,320
I wish you had already come.

533
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
"New Youth"

534
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
would have been given to you and Shouchang.

535
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
Honestly, New Culture in China

536
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
is only be seen in its infancy.

537
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,800
It may break at any time.

538
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
Plus, Peking University is a complex place

539
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,320
where all kinds of political thought agitate each other.

540
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
You should have enough mental preparation.

541
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
Sir, you mentioned Shouchang,

542
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,160
he's from Hebei.

543
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,360
Li Dazhao.

544
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
I believe that although you two have never met,

545
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
you must become instant friends,

546
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,280
because I often dream

547
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
the three of us together.

548
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
You dreamed the three of us together?

549
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,360
Yes, more than once.

550
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
That's an extraordinary insight.

551
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
Chivalrous, generous and elegiac people.

552
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,920
I often see the three of us in my dreams

553
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,240
working together on "New Youth".

554
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
I also believe that the three of us

555
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,120
will definitely push forward the New Culture Movement.

556
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,160
Good.

557
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
For New Culture.

558
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
For your ideals.

559
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
Hu Shi is willing to do his part.

560
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,800
Sir.

561
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
I believe in one of your sayings.

562
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,360
"I won't talk about politics for twenty years

563
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,760
but dedicate oneself to developing the enlightenment of people's wisdom."

564
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,600
This is the way to save the nation.

565
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,120
To you.

566
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,640
Good.

567
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,560
Have ambition,

568
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,200
but this can't be done

569
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,400
by just saying a few words.

570
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,680
It's hard to not talk about politics for twenty years.

571
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,000
The Zhang Xun Restoration

572
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,160
has had tremenduous consequences.

573
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,360
If he had really succeeded this time,

574
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,840
then "New Youth", New Culture,

575
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,680
would have all been rejected.

576
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
Honestly, sir,

577
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
before returning home this time, my heart

578
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,640
had always been uneasy.

579
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
But seeing you today,

580
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,360
this stone in my heart

581
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,440
has fallen to the ground.

582
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Hmm.

583
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,920
Thank you, sir, for your encouragement and support.

584
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,840
Be kind to me, sir.

585
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,680
Hu Shi has nothing to offer in return.

586
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,560
I am willing to follow you.

587
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,280
I made up my mind when I returned home.

588
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,560
I have neither complaint nor regret.

589
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,440
I will be a Huizhou camel to carry forward New Culture.

590
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,760
Good.

591
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,720
A Huizhou camel.

592
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,560
Well put.

593
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,400
Here.

594
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
Then let us two Huizhou camels follow the local customs

595
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,560
according to the old saying in Beijing.

596
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,884
Cheers.

597
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:44,831
Cheers.

598
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,520
Mr. Cai.

599
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,320
Hello.

600

Mr. Cai.

601
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,040
Hello.

602
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,640
Mr. Cai.

603
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,520
You're came.

604
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,880
Hello, shopkeeper Li.

605
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,640
I--

606
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,160
I-- I would like to meet my collegues.

607
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
This way, please.

608
00:25:18,974 --> 00:25:19,477
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

609
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,560
Shizhi.

610
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,760
Mr. Cai came to see you.

611
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:22,800
Sir.

612
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,680
Please sit down.

613
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Waiter, another pair of chopsticks!

614
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,200
Got it!

615
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Hello, sir.

616
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,240
Zhongfu.

617
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,520
I heard that there were two rabbits eating grass beside their burrow.

618
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
This old rabbit has arrived.

619
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,880
I'll order a large dish.

620
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,360
You won't object, will you?

621
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
Come, sir, Shizhi.

622
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,640
Sit down and chat.

623
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,440
Alright.

624
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,680
I saw you two when I came here just now.

625
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
You were elated.

626
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,240
What were you talking about?

627
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,320
I and Shizhi were talking about

628
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,880
New Culture and "New Youth".

629
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,640
The New Culture Movement is rising.

630
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,080
Every step, walking on thin ice.

631
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,600
Between you two,

632
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
one is the master,

633
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,480
the other is the pioneer.

634
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,320
What a perfect match.

635
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,680
Come.

636
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,280
I hope you will unite sincerely with Peking University colleagues

637
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,640
to run "New Youth",

638
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,880
leading the trend of history to carry forth a new generation.

639
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,400
Master Cai can rest assured that our generation will forge ahead.

640
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,520
I'll just do a good job

641
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,200
by giving you some advice.

642
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,640
The vanguard of the movement depends on Shouchang,

643
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
Shizhi,

644
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
and Zhou Shuren.

645
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,160
Zhou Shuren is an

646
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,640
incredible leader.

647
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,240
Master Cai, Master Cai.

648
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
We thought of the same thing.

649
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,880
So, have you all agreed

650
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
what classes Shizhi will teach next semester?

651
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,080
I--

652
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,720
Sir, the first course I want to teach is

653
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
history of Chinese philosophy.

654
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,920
This is a little out of my expectation.

655
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,000
Everyone wants you to teach Chinese literature.

656
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
That's above my expectation.

657
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,600
Gentlemen, I think so too.

658
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,440
I think there is a misunderstanding

659
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
about the New Culture Movement

660
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,800
at home and overseas.

661
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,640
I think that the New Culture Movement

662
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,280
is a complete negation of Chinese traditional culture.

663
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
In fact, New Culture

664
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,160
is created within the strong protection of traditional culture.

665
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,120
So,

666
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,920
I want to make a systematic review

667
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
of the development of Chinese ideology and culture

668
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,880
to help everyone clarify the relationship between the two.

669
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,880
This is also the content of my doctoral thesis.

670
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,720
Well said.

671
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,480
Very well put.

672
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,080
I agree.

673
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,040
There is one more thing I want to explain to Mr. Cai.

674
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,760
Go ahead.

675
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
My doctoral thesis failed in the first round.

676
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,240
I'm making further amendments

677
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,800
under Dewey's supervision

678
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
and trying to pass the next round.

679
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,880
I know this,

680
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
so don't emphasize it deliberately.

681
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,560
Well, since ancient times, men have hated each other,

682
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,520
but what they have always loved is Erguotou.

683
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,600

There isn't any.

You see what kind of list this is?

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,920
Hu Shi, that yellow-haired child, is on the list.

701
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,160
I came behind last.

702
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
What's wrong with this?

703
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,520
Peking University treats several masters of Chinese culture like this.

704
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,200
We refuse to accept!

705
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,560
Yeah! We refuse!

Way out of line!

708
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,920
That's not possible!

709
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,640
Yeah!

710

What the hell is this?

This gentleman can't shut his mouth.

I have to ask Mr. Cai for an explanation.

718

If it's serious, go back to that lousy temple.

719

Besides, I don't want to go back to that lousy temple.

You should go back to that lousy temple!

725

How unusual for the two of you to come to me

726

full of disapproval and complaint.

727
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,240
Alright. How have you been wronged?

I, Yuanpei, will make it right for you.

729

Mr. Cai, if I may ask,

730
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
how was the list of committee members

731
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,400
on the school appraisal council produced?

732
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,400
Ah, so it is this matter.

733
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
I will explain.

734
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,920
After the Zhang Xun Restoration incident,

735
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,760
I was requested by the Ministry of Education

736
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,920
to readjust the school appraisal committee membership

737
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,880
based on fluctuations in the number of qualified teaching staff.

[Gu Hongming, born Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

739
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
So based on the ministry's request

740
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,240
the school council, after much deliberation,

741
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
have now put together a list of candidates

742
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,800
for public feedback.

743
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,520
I suppose you both have already seen it.

744
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,960
What do you think? Please speak your mind.

745
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,040
I recall Mr. Cai once stated

746
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,560
academic performance

747
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,440
shall be the basis of professorial appointments at Peking University.

748
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,320
In light of this standard, we both believe

749
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,480
there is a high proportion of chaff on the

750
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,720
proposed list of candidates for the appraisal committee.

751
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,760
Master Cai, such an appraisal committee

752
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,160
would destroy the reputation of Peking University.

753
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,760
Mr. Huang Kan, please elaborate.

754
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,840
What sort of person is that Hu Shi?

755
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,560
He is merely a student who has just graduated.

756
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,000
Peking University is China's highest institution of learning.

757
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,880
How could it possibly

758
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
need a youth who can only sing a few farfetched nursery rhymes

759
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
on the appraisal committee?

760
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Master Cai, allow me to be blunt.

761
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,280
If all Hu Shi needs to do is say a few words of vernacular Chinese,

762
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,640
speak a few foreign words

763
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,160
to become a professor, become a member of the appraisal committee,

764
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,400
then let's not bother calling our Peking University as such any longer.

765
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,360
It might as well be the University of Vernacular Chinese.

766
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,000
That's right.

767
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,600
Hu Shi

768
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,160
is an outstanding student from Columbia University.

769
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,760
A young talent recommended

770
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,240
to Peking University from overseas.

771
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,160
Though he is young,

772
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,000
he has published extensively

773
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,240
and has impeccable academic credentials.

774
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,040
Amongst the younger students, he is very influential.

775
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,840
So to choose him for the appraisal committee

776
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
also boosts the moral of the younger students.

777
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
So that reforms will more strongly take root.

778
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Master Cai, I myself studied abroad as a youth in England,

779
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,000
I was awarded a Master's degree in literature from the University of Edinburgh at the age of twenty.

780
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,160
I am proficient in nine foreign languages.

781
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
If I'm not even qualified to be

782
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,040
an appraisal committee member,

783
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,880
then how could Hu Shi, newly returned and without any achievements,

784
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,440
possibly deserve his position?

785
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,560
It is true that you are world renowned.

786
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,360
But you abetted the Zhang Xun Restoration,

787
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,240
which has already aroused much popular indignation and anger.

788
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,600
Furthermore, there are many joint letters from students and teachers

789
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,360
calling for the removal of your teaching position.

790
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,160
Do you think it's appropriate

791
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,360
for you to be on the appraisal committee

792
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,960
at such a time?

793
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,160
Mr. Cai, haven't you always emphasized

794
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,160
that the most important standard at Peking University

795
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,280
is academic ability?

796
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,280
If we are judging on the basis of political orientation,

797
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,120
while I, Huang Kan, was waging revolution,

798
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
what was Hu Shi even doing?

799
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,520
I really do take professional ability very seriously.

800
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
However, the country has certain stipulations.

801
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,280
This reselection of appraisal committee members

802
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,120
must abide by the clear cut policies set by the Ministry of Education.

803
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,720
One of which is that the appraisal committee members

804
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
in terms of politics, must support republicanism.

805
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,080
Another, that teachers must have favourable personal attributes.

806
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,440
A third, that must be representatives from different administrative levels, and so on.

807
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,000
Which is why you two experts were not chosen.

808
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,680
I probably don't need to list

809
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,560
the specific reasons one by one.

810
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,160
I know the two of you are somewhat prejudiced

811
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,840
against Hu Shi.

812
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,120
To be quite honest, I had the same impression.

813
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,840
But after I met Hu Shi,

814
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,440
and conversed with him,

815
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,520
his reasoning and his views

816
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,400
dispelled my misgivings.

817
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,280
Hu Shi is, after all,

818
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,280
a representative of new culture.

819
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,200
Besides, Hu Shi is a brilliant student

820
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
of the American master of pragmatism, John Dewey.

821
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,120
It has extensive influence

822
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,960
amongst many students.

823
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,360
I am planning to ask Hu Shi

824
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,800
to prepare a lecture for us at Peking University.

825
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
I invite both experts to attend.

826
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
The level of his abilities

827
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,400
will be clear upon listening.

828
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,240
Alright. When the time comes I will be certain to sing his praises.

829
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,520
Great.

830
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,520
Mind your step.

831
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,040
Come over here.

832
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,960
Hurry and find Mr. Hu Shi.

833
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,480
Tell him to see me.

834
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
I have to talk to him.

835
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,040
Alright.

836
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,120
Please sit.

837
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Esteemed collegues,

838
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,120
Zhang Xun does his restoration and Peking University is rocked by an earthquake.

839
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,920
For over three months

840
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
my students at Peking University

841
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,560
was unable to focus on learning, on studying.

842
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,560
For over three months

843
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,080
my teaching staff at Peking University

844
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,520
was unable to use their energy on teaching, on giving classes.

845
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,760
For over three months

846
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,520
my collegues at Peking University

847
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,480
were unable to pursue their studies in peace.

848
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,520
The very thought of it causes grief.

849
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,080
Some have asked me, with all this turmoil,

850
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,400
what is Peking University to do?

851
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,120
What is the fate of new culture?

852
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,160
Today, we've finally re-opened the school.

853
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,880
On the occasional of today's opening ceremony,

854
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,000
I have eight words for everyone present.

855
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,720
Our original intent is immovable, our commitment unwavering.

856
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,160
A few days ago, Dr. Hu Shi came to Peking Univerity.

857
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,360
He gave me an essay

858
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,200
that he published when he was in the United States.

859
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,400
Its title is "Against Studying Abroad."

860
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,920
Its topic is on the question

861
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
of how universities pursue knowledge.

862
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,240
I was very stimulated by reading it.

863
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,120
Therefore, I've changed things up

864
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,640
for today's opening ceremony.

865
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,800
I've invited Dr. Hu Shi

866
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
to give us a lecture.

867
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,040
Its title is

868
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,880
"The Relationship Between The University and Chinese Higher Learning"

869
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,080
We invite Dr. Hu Shi to come onstage.

870
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,240
You shall know the difference

871
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,960
now that we are back again.

872
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,560
This is a quote

873
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,320
from the epics of Homer.

874
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,960
It means "Now that we are back again

875
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,960
you shall know the difference."

876
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,480
What? What does this mean?

877
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,200
I believe that these words also represent

878
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,240
what every scholar at Peking University feels at this very moment.

879
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,520
A noble king ought also listen to the opinions of others

880
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,120
and proceed with caution.

881
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,480
I give you a piece of advice.

882
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,160
Do not forget it.

883
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,000
I'd like to ask Dr. Hu Shi what I've just said.

884
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,800
Apologies, sir.

885
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,560
I truly do not understand what you said.

886
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,920
I just recited Homer

887
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,240
in the original Greek.

888
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,520
The meaning in Chinese is

889
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,000
A noble king ought also listen to the opinions of others

890
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
and proceed with caution.

891
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
I give you a piece of advice.

892
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,880
Do not forget it.

893
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,880
It is forgivable

894
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,680
that Dr. Hu Shi doesn't understand Greek

895
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
and recites Ancient Greek poetry in English.

896
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,400
But if ancient Greek poetry is to be recited in English

897
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,720
it ought to be the pure English

898
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
of a London gentleman.

899
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,920
Your pronunciation is far too inept.

900
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,800
Entirely that of a commoner.

901
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,280
A proper London gentleman sounds like this.

902
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,080
You shall know the difference

903
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
now that we are back again.

904
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,720
Ok?

905
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,920
Wonderful!

906
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,200
This must be

907
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,360
the illustrious Mr. Gu Hongming.

908
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,840
To have received your instruction at our first meeting

909
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
is a great honour.

910
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,320
I am vey thankful for Mr. Gu's correction

911
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,880
of my English pronunciation.

912
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,560
But today

913
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,800
I use this quote from Homer

914
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
without regard for its language, its pronunciation, its tone.

915
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
I don't care whether it is said

916
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,080
in proper London English

917
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,920
or with the pronunciation of a commoner.

918
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,280
What I care about is

919
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
the meaning it conveys.

920
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Now that we are back,

921
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,440
you shall know the difference.

922
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,360
This statement is also what I wish to deliver to you.

923
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,120
This statement...

924
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
is what I wish to deliver to everyone sitting here as well.

925
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,720
This is a statement from us at Peking University

926
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,400
towards an outdated China.

927
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,600
A manifesto aimed at an outdated culture.

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,120
And it is also a solemn statement of commitment

00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,520
to the successful future of Peking University!
