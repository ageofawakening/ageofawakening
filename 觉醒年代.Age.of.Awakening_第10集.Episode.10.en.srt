Mr. Zhongfu.

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
I am here to discuss with you,

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,280
matters involving the children.

58
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,080
Now the country is facing internal strife.

59
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,120
Because of Zhang Xun's restoration, classes have stopped.

60
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Even if we resume classes,

61
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,760
it will be during the next semester.

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
Countless wars are happening overseas.

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
So they want to go to France to work and study.

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm afraid we can't provide a schedule at such short notice.

65
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,360
Mr. Liu, what do you intend to do then?

66
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,200
I do not want to disrupt our children's futures,

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
so I was thinking if both our families can work together

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,440
and send the three of them to America to study.

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,960
I'll handle the paperwork

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
and expenses.

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,480
Mr. Liu,

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,520
this is already the second time you have brought this up.

73
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,840
I appreciate your concern

74
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
and understand your feelings,

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,520
but I will tell you frankly

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
I cannot agree to this.

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
All these things.

78
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,600
I think Mr. Zhongfu

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,040
has prepared for Yannian and Qiaonian right?

80
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,480
Yes indeed.

81
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,800
Parents want the best for their children.

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,960
Mr. Zhongfu, Liu Mei is my only daughter,

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
so I understand how you feel.

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,960
I can really understand

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,080
a father's love for his children.

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,920
But Mr. Zhongfu,

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
regarding this matter,

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
why are you so steadfast in your choice?

89
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,080
Mr. Liu, please do not misunderstand.

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm not being steadfast.

91
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,440
Firstly, I'm not able to decide on Yannian's behalf.

92
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Secondly, Yannian

93
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,680
will never accept

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,640
others' help.

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,160
Let me tell you honestly,

96
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm worried about his attitude

97
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,320
because Yannian

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,160
is too disciplined and confident.

99
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,080
I am not able to convince him.

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,435
I feel extremely guilty

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
that, as his father,

102
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,840
I have no right to speak.

103
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
Mr. Zhongfu,

104
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
the two children

105
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,200
are already in a relationship,

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,480
so I feel that,

107
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
as elders,

108
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
we should care about their future.

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,000
This is an issue.

110
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,680
The two children

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,280
are in what kind of relationship?

112
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,320
They--

113
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm not sure if I can explain it clearly.

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,640
I understand

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,160
Mr. Liu, how about this.

116
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,080
I'll talk to him.

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,520
We need to establish the facts first,

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
so we don't make any mistakes.

119
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,840
Let me handle it.

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,920
After I get an answer,

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
we'll speak again.

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Thank you so much.

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
You're too gracious.

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll take my leave first.

125
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
Why don't you stay for a meal.

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
No, no, no.

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
I know you haven't finished your previous discussion.

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
No need to send me off.

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,920
Alright, take your time.

130
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll wait for your response.

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,880
Alright.

132

Baisha!

133
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
On the day of Zhang Xun's restoration,

134
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,280
Li Dazhao was forced to leave Beijing.

135
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
For several months, he was exiled in Jiangnan

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
and fell to the lowest rungs of society

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,680
to observe national sentiments

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
and to clear his thoughts,

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
desperately finding a way to save his country.

140
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
The Zhang Xun Restoration

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
signaled that

142
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,120
the plan for the establishment of a bourgeois republic in China

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,240
failed completely.

144

[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang]

146

hastened the reform of the bourgeois

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
and caused a change in perception and criticism.

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,760
The modern Chinese

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,640
started to realize

150
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,560
that simply relying on transplanting

151
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,400
Western political ideology and methods

152
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,680
cannot save China.

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Saving China would require starting from the basics.

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,320
Apart from a cultural awakening

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,120
and enlightenment,

156
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
listening to the voices of the people is crucial

157
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,080
to find a suitable solution to reform China.

158
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,720

Uncle Wang!

162
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,120
My father wouldn't have left right?

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
No, he wouldn't have

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
He would not have left before seeing the both of you.

[Chen Yannian, Chen Duxiu's eldest son]

166
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Even if he had left, he wouldn't have gone far.

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
Would he have gone to Jixi

168
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,720
to see Hu Shi?

169
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
I told you we shouldn't have come.

170

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,560
Older brother!

Yannian!

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
These are the buns your aunt steamed.

174
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
I was afraid it would spoil in the hot weather so I heated it up again.

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,720
Come.

176
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
Yannian, come.

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
Listen to Uncle.

178
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
Come.

179
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
Sit here.

180

181

Look.

182
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,960
I told you he hasn't left yet.

183
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
He went to steam buns for you.

184
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,480
Yesterday,

185
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,680
your father said

186
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
to send these buns to school.

187
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Gao Junman helped me to steam it.

188
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,880
She told me to eat it while travelling.

189
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,120
It's quite a lot, so help yourself.

Come let's eat.

191

It's meat.

192
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,760
Please eat, your aunt steamed it for you.

Didn't you say it was meant for you.

195
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,160
There are two different fillings,

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,120
vegetarian and meat.

197
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
I've finished the vegetarian filling.

198
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,600
The meat filling is for you.

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,760
Can you stop pretending?

200
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Since when was there vegetarian fillings?

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
Why do I not know about them?

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,600
You have eaten them.

203

Your aunt steamed these buns for you.

204

He intentionally left them for you.

205

Come, eat.

207

208

and you had to lie about vegetarian fillings.

209
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
Stop pretending.

210
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
Speak honestly.

211
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,160
I've finally managed to see you this time.

212
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,800
So let's chat.

213
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,520
Let's chat about two things.

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Firstly, the both of you have come out

215
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
to see the world at such a young age.

216
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,600
Makes me relieved to see the both of you so self-reliant.

217
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
You want to go to France to work and study.

218
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
I am supportive as well.

219
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
But now there is a world war going on.

220
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
The plan of staying in France is still far away.

221
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,160
Our country is also experiencing internal strife.

222
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
You can't always remain

223
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,200
at this French language centre.

224
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,120
If you do not have a long term plan, you will definitely have worries.

225
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,800
I want to know

226
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,400
what your thoughts are.

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
Both of us will walk this path alone.

228
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,000
We won't rely on others and our family.

229
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
To us, work-study

230
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
is the most appropriate path.

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
We plan to study in France.

232
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,720
We have a very strong foundation now,

233
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
we will not give up halfway.

234
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
So we have decided to remain in Shanghai to study.

235
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,520
Yadong Library's business is doing well.

236
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
We should be able to work-study with no issues.

237
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,280
Most importantly we have many books to read here.

238
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,640
We can't bear to leave.

239
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,360
That's right.

240
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
We can go to Beijing during the holidays.

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,560
Alright, since you have already thought hard about it,

242
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,640
I will respect your wishes.

243
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,480
Secondly,

244
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,000
can you tell me

245
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,360
what your relationship is with Liu Mei?

246
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,560
What do you mean?

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't you think that

248
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
everyone is curious about it?

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm not surprised that people are curious.

250
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
I did not expect you to be curious about it as well.

251
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,000
Why not?

252
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,040
Because I feel that you

253
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
are not such a superficial person.

254
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,520
Is it superficial for me to be concerned about you and Liu Mei?

255
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Since you are as superficial as everyone else,

256
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
I will tell you clearly

257
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,960
that I, Liu Mei and Qiaonian

258
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,440
have a pure and noble relationship

259
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,800
based on mutual cooperation.

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
I don't quite understand.

261
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,280
Have you read Kropotkin's

262
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
and Tolstoy's books?

263
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,440
Yes I have.

264
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,960
So you must know about mutualism,

265
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,480
anarchism,

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
and pan-laborism.

267
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,800
I know a little.

268
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
So you should know about

269
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
what is mankind's ideal state.

270
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,840
I'm all ears.

271
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
Mankind's most ideal state

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
is when the whole society

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,760
continuously achieves moral self-improvement

274
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,720
through self-discipline.

275
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,160
Everyone will work together

276
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
and form a relationship that transcends familial and romantic ties.

277
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,760
Oh, so you and Liu Mei have this sort of relationship.

278
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
This is what I desire.

279
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,760
Then, other people get the impression

280
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
that you and her are a couple.

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,520
A couple?

282
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Like butterfly lovers, do you understand?

283
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
Mandarin ducks or something, you know?

284
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,160
This is the difference in our generations.

285
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,960
Your generation can't get rid of the obstacle of superficiality.

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,480
But to us,

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,160
that is our goal.

288
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,280
What we desire

289
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,200
is an eternal pure and noble friendship.

290
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,760
Does Liu Mei have the same understanding as you?

291
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Of course.

292
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,760
Additionally, I am

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
imposing a self-discipline rule on myself.

294
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,640
I call it the six prohibitions.

295
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,000
What do you mean?

296
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
They are no skiving, no watching of shows, no photography,

297
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
no eating at restaurants, no talking about fashion

298
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
but most importantly,

299
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
no dating, no private relationships.

300
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,400
If society is able to be disciplined

301
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
and continuously self-improve,

302
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,120
everyone will come together

303
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,720
to form relationships that transcend familial and romantic ties.

304
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,640
So doesn't that make me and your aunt,

305
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,160
your aunt and your Uncle Wang,

306
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,280

309

the same type of relationship?

310
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,040
That would be it.

311
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
Then why do you address your aunt as mother?

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,000
That's just a name.

313
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
So what do you call me then?

314
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
I've always called you Chen Duxiu.

315
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
Alright, I'll leave, please continue eating.

319

Tell everyone what this seal means.

348

My verdict is that it is extraordinary.

The words "Beida" (=Peking University) written in seal script are written vertically.

The "Bei" at the top

352
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,440
is written such that it looks like two people with their backs facing each other.

This is a man carrying two people on his back,

357
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240
