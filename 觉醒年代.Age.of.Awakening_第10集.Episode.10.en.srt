Mr. Zhongfu.

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
I am here to discuss with you,

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,280
matters involving the children.

58
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,080
Now the country is facing internal strife.

59
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,120
Because of Zhang Xun's restoration, classes have stopped.

60
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Even if we resume classes,

61
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,760
it will be during the next semester.

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
Countless wars are happening overseas.

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
So they want to go to France to work and study.

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm afraid we can't provide a schedule at such short notice.

65
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,360
Mr. Liu, what do you intend to do then?

66
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,200
I do not want to disrupt our children's futures,

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
so I was thinking if both our families can work together

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,440
and send the three of them to America to study.

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,960
I'll handle the paperwork

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
and expenses.

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,480
Mr. Liu,

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,520
this is already the second time you have brought this up.

73
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,840
I appreciate your concern

74
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
and understand your feelings,

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,520
but I will tell you frankly

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
I cannot agree to this.

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
All these things.

78
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,600
I think Mr. Zhongfu

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,040
has prepared for Yannian and Qiaonian right?

80
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,480
Yes indeed.

81
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,800
Parents want the best for their children.

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,960
Mr. Zhongfu, Liu Mei is my only daughter,

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
so I understand how you feel.

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,960
I can really understand

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,080
a father's love for his children.

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,920
But Mr. Zhongfu,

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
regarding this matter,

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
why are you so steadfast in your choice?

89
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,080
Mr. Liu, please do not misunderstand.

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm not being steadfast.

91
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,440
Firstly, I'm not able to decide on Yannian's behalf.

92
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Secondly, Yannian

93
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,680
will never accept

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,640
others' help.

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,160
Let me tell you honestly,

96
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm worried about his attitude

97
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,320
because Yannian

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,160
is too disciplined and confident.

99
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,080
I am not able to convince him.

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,435
I feel extremely guilty

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
that, as his father,

102
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,840
I have no right to speak.

103
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
Mr. Zhongfu,

104
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
the two children

105
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,200
are already in a relationship,

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,480
so I feel that,

107
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
as elders,

108
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
we should care about their future.

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,000
This is an issue.

110
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,680
The two children

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,280
are in what kind of relationship?

112
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,320
They--

113
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm not sure if I can explain it clearly.

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,640
I understand

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,160
Mr. Liu, how about this.

116
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,080
I'll talk to him.

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,520
We need to establish the facts first,

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
so we don't make any mistakes.

119
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,840
Let me handle it.

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,920
After I get an answer,

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
we'll speak again.

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Thank you so much.

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
You're too gracious.

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll take my leave first.

125
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
Why don't you stay for a meal.

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
No, no, no.

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
I know you haven't finished your previous discussion.

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
No need to send me off.

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,920
Alright, take your time.

130
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll wait for your response.

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,880
Alright.

132

Baisha!

133
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
On the day of Zhang Xun's restoration,

134
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,280
Li Dazhao was forced to leave Beijing.

135
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
For several months, he was exiled in Jiangnan

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
and fell to the lowest rungs of society

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,680
to observe national sentiments

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
and to clear his thoughts,

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
desperately finding a way to save his country.

140
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
The Zhang Xun Restoration

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
signaled that

142
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,120
the plan for the establishment of a bourgeois republic in China

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,240
failed completely.

144

[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang]

146

hastened the reform of the bourgeois

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
and caused a change in perception and criticism.

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,760
The modern Chinese

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,640
started to realize

150
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,560
that simply relying on transplanting

151
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,400
Western political ideology and methods

152
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,680
cannot save China.

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Saving China would require starting from the basics.

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,320
Apart from a cultural awakening

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,120
and enlightenment,

156
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
listening to the voices of the people is crucial

157
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,080
to find a suitable solution to reform China.

158
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,720

Uncle Wang!

162
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,120
My father wouldn't have left right?

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
No, he wouldn't have

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
He would not have left before seeing the both of you.

[Chen Yannian, Chen Duxiu's eldest son]

166
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Even if he had left, he wouldn't have gone far.

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
Would he have gone to Jixi

168
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,720
to see Hu Shi?

169
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
I told you we shouldn't have come.

170

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,560
Older brother!

Yannian!

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
These are the buns your aunt steamed.

174
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
I was afraid it would spoil in the hot weather so I heated it up again.

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,720
Come.

176
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
Yannian, come.

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
Listen to Uncle.

178
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
Come.

179
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
Sit here.

180

181

Look.

182
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,960
I told you he hasn't left yet.

183
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
He went to steam buns for you.

184
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,480
Yesterday,

185
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,680
your father said

186
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
to send these buns to school.

187
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Gao Junman helped me to steam it.

188
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,880
She told me to eat it while travelling.

189
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,120
It's quite a lot, so help yourself.

191

It's meat.

192

Didn't you say it was meant for you.

195
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,160
There are two different fillings,

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,120
vegetarian and meat.

197
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
I've finished the vegetarian filling.

198
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,600
The meat filling is for you.

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,760
Can you stop pretending?

200
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Since when was there vegetarian fillings?

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
Why do I not know about them?

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,600
You have eaten them.

204

208

and you had to lie about vegetarian fillings.

209
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
Stop pretending.

210
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
Speak honestly.

211
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,160
I've finally managed to see you this time.

212
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,800
So let's chat.

213
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,520
Let's chat about two things.

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Firstly, the both of you have come out

215
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
to see the world at such a young age.

216
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,600
Makes me relieved to see the both of you so self-reliant.

217
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
You want to go to France to work and study.

218
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
I am supportive as well.

219
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
But now there is a world war going on.

220
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
The plan of staying in France is still far away.

221
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,160
Our country is also experiencing internal strife.

222
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
You can't always remain

223
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,200
at this French language centre.

224
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,120
If you do not have a long term plan, you will definitely have worries.

225
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,800
I want to know

226
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,400
what your thoughts are.

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
Both of us will walk this path alone.

228
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,000
We won't rely on others and our family.

229
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
To us, work-study

230
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
is the most appropriate path.

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
We plan to study in France.

232
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,720
We have a very strong foundation now,

233
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
we will not give up halfway.

234
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
So we have decided to remain in Shanghai to study.

235
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,520
Yadong Library's business is doing well.

236
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
We should be able to work-study with no issues.

237
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,280
Most importantly we have many books to read here.

238
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,640
We can't bear to leave.

239
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,360
That's right.

240
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
We can go to Beijing during the holidays.

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,560
Alright, since you have already thought hard about it,

242
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,640
I will respect your wishes.

243
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,480
Secondly,

244
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,000
can you tell me

245
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,360
what your relationship is with Liu Mei?

246
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,560
What do you mean?

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't you think that

248
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
everyone is curious about it?

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm not surprised that people are curious.

250
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
I did not expect you to be curious about it as well.

251
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,000
Why not?

252
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,040
Because I feel that you

253
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
are not such a superficial person.

254
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,520
Is it superficial for me to be concerned about you and Liu Mei?

255
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Since you are as superficial as everyone else,

256
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
I will tell you clearly

257
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,960
that I, Liu Mei and Qiaonian

258
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,440
have a pure and noble relationship

259
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,800
based on mutual cooperation.

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
I don't quite understand.

261
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,280
Have you read Kropotkin's

262
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
and Tolstoy's books?

263
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,440
Yes I have.

264
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,960
So you must know about mutualism,

265
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,480
anarchism,

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
and pan-laborism.

267
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,800
I know a little.

268
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
So you should know about

269
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
what is mankind's ideal state.

270
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,840
I'm all ears.

271
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
Mankind's most ideal state

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
is when the whole society

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,760
continuously achieves moral self-improvement

274
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,720
through self-discipline.

275
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,160
Everyone will work together

276
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
and form a relationship that transcends familial and romantic ties.

277
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,760
Oh, so you and Liu Mei have this sort of relationship.

278
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
This is what I desire.

279
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,760
Then, other people get the impression

280
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
that you and her are a couple.

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,520
A couple?

282
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Like butterfly lovers, do you understand?

283
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
Mandarin ducks or something, you know?

284
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,160
This is the difference in our generations.

285
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,960
Your generation can't get rid of the obstacle of superficiality.

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,480
But to us,

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,160
that is our goal.

288
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,280
What we desire

289
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,200
is an eternal pure and noble friendship.

290
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,760
Does Liu Mei have the same understanding as you?

291
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Of course.

292
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,760
Additionally, I am

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
imposing a self-discipline rule on myself.

294
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,640
I call it the six prohibitions.

295
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,000
What do you mean?

296
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
They are no skiving, no watching of shows, no photography,

297
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
no eating at restaurants, no talking about fashion

298
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
but most importantly,

299
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
no dating, no private relationships.

300
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,400
If society is able to be disciplined

301
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
and continuously self-improve,

302
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,120
everyone will come together

303
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,720
to form relationships that transcend familial and romantic ties.

304
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,640
So doesn't that make me and your aunt,

305
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,160
your aunt and your Uncle Wang,

306
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,280

309

the same type of relationship?

310
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,040
That would be it.

311
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
Then why do you address your aunt as mother?

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,000
That's just a name.

313
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
So what do you call me then?

314
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
I've always called you Chen Duxiu.

315
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880

316

Alright, I'll leave, please continue eating.

319

Tell everyone what this seal means.

348

My verdict is that it is extraordinary.

The words "Beida" (=Peking University) written in seal script are written vertically.

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,960
The "Bei" at the top

352
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,440
is written such that it looks like two people with their backs facing each other.

353

This is a man carrying two people on his back,

which then symbolizes a meaning of a crowd.

357
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240

I think this is too Western.

374
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Too abstract.

375
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,200
It doesn't reflect the essence of Peking University.

376
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Peking University is the successor to the Imperial College's teachings.

365
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:26,656
[Liu Bannong, Professor at Peking University]

366
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,840
The ancestral hall of this university

367
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,520
is the highest institution that inherits

368
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
our Chinese cultural tradition.

369
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,680
Do you need to use

370
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
this Western conception to embody it?

371
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,040
Frivolous.

372
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
Doesn't this image exactly have Chinese characteristics?

373
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,600
Is there anything better than this?

374
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,394
[Hu Shi, styled Shizhi, Professor at Peking University]

387
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,200
This is inauspicious!

388
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,840
Alright, alright.

389
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,080
Let each express one's opinions and contend with another.

390
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
This is the ethos of Peking University.

391
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Don't always let ourselves speak.

392
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,880
Exactly.

393
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
Let the students speak too.

394
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,760
Zhongxia, come and speak.

395
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,280
Zhongxia, come.

396
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,760
Speak.

397
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
I think the seal is quite interesting.

398
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,720
Look at the arrangement of these three "people".

399
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,840
What about these two "people"?

400
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
Like two students back-to-back.

401
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,640
What about the person below?

[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhongxie, Student at Peking University]

391
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
It's like a bowing teacher.

392
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,840
The teacher is lifting the two students with his shoulders.

393
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,760
The teacher is thus willing to be a ladder.

394
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,680
The students have lofty aspirations.

395
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600

Gentlemen.

398

I don't know what to say either.

I just think this design is very powerful.

400

Hello everyone, I'd like to ask

which one is Mr. Chen Zhongfu.

I--

407
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,240
I know you went to Shanghai to meet me.

408
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,720
Shizhi--

409
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
There was something at home, so I had to get back in a hurry

410
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,680
and make you come for nothing.

Shizhi, don't pay attention.

438

This is not to say that you are frivolous.

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,520
He's still sick. He's still seriously ill.

442
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,880
Okay, Yihan.

443
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,160
Has the Shizhi's luggage arrived yet?

All the luggage checked in from America

445

to bring tools

452
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,720

tidy up his room.

456
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,480
Yes, let's go.

457
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,320
Come, let's work together.

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,560
Come.

Sit on the chair.

463
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:40,767
Sit on the chair.

464
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,520
Thank you.

465
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,320
Enjoy your meal, gentlemen.

466
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
I can't see you clearly when I sit across.

467
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,400
I've been looking forward to you for half a year.

468
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,280
I finally got my wish to see you.

469
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,240
Have you tried lamb hotpot?

470
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,960
Lamb hotpot.

471
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,640
Not used to moving places.

472
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,880
Quanjude roast duck.

473
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's go, we're going now.

474
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,200
Sir, sir.

475
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
Lamb hotpot is great. I like it.

476
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
I can't eat it overseas.

477
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,717
Like it?

478
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:48,048
I like it.

479
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
If you like it, you can sit down.

480
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,720
Sit down, sir.

481
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,880
What wine would you like to drink?

482
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,480
Erguotou.

483
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,760
Pretty good.

484
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,480
Good.

485
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Since ancient times, men have hated each other,

486
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
but they have always loved Erguotou.

487
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,720
I'll pour it for you.

488
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,520
I'll do it, sir.

489
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,880
Let me mix the seasoning for you.

490
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,000
Alright.

491
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
When eating lamb hotpot,

492
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
the seasoning comes first.

493
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,960
I only learned it after I came to Beijing.

494
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
I'll do it, sir.

495
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,480
No, no, you can't.

496
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,520
This salty taste is very particular.

497
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
Sir, that's very kind.

498
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
I, Chen Duxiu, while spending half my life wandering,

499
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
have met quite a few scholars,

500
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
but most have little reputation,

501
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
only my good brother makes me feel inferior.

502
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,040
Several passages in the article "A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform"

503
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
are like mountains and rivers.

504
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,160
It often makes me feel so relaxed and mesmerized that I forgot about all my honors and regrets.

505
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,120
And to be honest,

506
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
every time I write to you,

507
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,520
it reminds me of the Boya and Ziqi friends.

508
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
Thank you, sir.

509
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,760
Come and taste the salty flavor.

510
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
You can add sesame paste if you feel it.

511
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
When it's light, you can add chive.

512
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,680
Small bites, small bites.

513
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,209
Perfect.

514
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:34,897
Perfect.

515
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:35,840
Good.

516
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,440
Come, eat some meat.

517
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
Sir.

518
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Would you like some?

519
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,280
Give me some.

520
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,320
I wish you had already come.

521
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
"New Youth"

522
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
would have been given to you and Shouchang.

523
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
Honestly, New Culture in China

524
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
is only be seen in its infancy.

525
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,800
It may break at any time.

526
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
Plus, Peking University is a complex place

527
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,320
where all kinds of political thought agitate each other.

528
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
You should have enough mental preparation.

529
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
Sir, you mentioned Shouchang,

530
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,160
he's from Hebei.

531
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,360
Li Dazhao.

532
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
I believe that although you two have never met,

533
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
you must become instant friends,

534
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,280
because I often dream

535
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
the three of us together.

536
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
You dreamed the three of us together?

537
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,360
Yes, more than once.

538
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
That's an extraordinary insight.

539
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
Chivalrous, generous and elegiac people.

540
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,920
I often see the three of us in my dreams

541
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,240
working together on "New Youth".

542
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
I also believe that the three of us

543
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,120
will definitely push forward the New Culture Movement.

544
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,160
Good.

545
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
For New Culture.

546
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
For your ideals.

547
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
Hu Shi is willing to do his part.

548
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,800
Sir.

549
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
I believe in one of your sayings.

550
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,360
"I won't talk about politics for twenty years

551
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,760
but dedicate oneself to developing the enlightenment of people's wisdom."

552
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,600
This is the way to save the nation.

553
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,120
To you.

554
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,640
Good.

555
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,560
Have ambition,

556
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,200
but this can't be done

557
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,400
by just saying a few words.

558
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,680
It's hard to not talk about politics for twenty years.

559
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,000
The Zhang Xun Restoration

560
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,160
has had tremenduous consequences.

561
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,360
If he had really succeeded this time,

562
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,840
then "New Youth", New Culture,

563
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,680
would have all been rejected.

564
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
Honestly, sir,

565
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
before returning home this time, my heart

566
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,640
had always been uneasy.

567
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
But seeing you today,

568
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,360
this stone in my heart

569
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,440
has fallen to the ground.

570
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Hmm.

571
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,920
Thank you, sir, for your encouragement and support.

572
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,840
Be kind to me, sir.

573
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,680
Hu Shi has nothing to offer in return.

574
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,560
I am willing to follow you.

575
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,280
I made up my mind when I returned home.

576
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,560
I have neither complaint nor regret.

577
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,440
I will be a Huizhou camel to carry forward New Culture.

578
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,760
Good.

579
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,720
A Huizhou camel.

580
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,560
Well put.

581
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,400
Here.

582
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
Then let us two Huizhou camels follow the local customs

583
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,560
according to the old saying in Beijing.

584
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,884
Cheers.

585
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:44,831
Cheers.

586
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,520
Mr. Cai.

587
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,320
Hello.

588

Mr. Cai.

589
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,040
Hello.

590
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,640
Mr. Cai.

591
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,520
You're came.

592
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,880
Hello, shopkeeper Li.

593
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,640
I--

594
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,160
I-- I would like to meet my collegues.

595
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
This way, please.

596
00:25:18,974 --> 00:25:19,477
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

597
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,560
Shizhi.

598
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,760
Mr. Cai came to see you.

599
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:22,800
Sir.

600
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,680
Please sit down.

601
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Waiter, another pair of chopsticks!

602
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,200
Got it!

603
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Hello, sir.

604
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,240
Zhongfu.

605
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,520
I heard that there were two rabbits eating grass beside their burrow.

606
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
This old rabbit has arrived.

607
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,880
I'll order a large dish.

608
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,360
You won't object, will you?

609
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
Come, sir, Shizhi.

610
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,640
Sit down and chat.

611
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,440
Alright.

612
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,680
I saw you two when I came here just now.

613
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
You were elated.

614
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,240
What were you talking about?

615
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,320
I and Shizhi were talking about

616
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,880
New Culture and "New Youth".

617
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,640
The New Culture Movement is rising.

618
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,080
Every step, walking on thin ice.

619
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,600
Between you two,

620
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
one is the master,

621
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,480
the other is the pioneer.

622
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,320
What a perfect match.

623
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,680
Come.

624
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,280
I hope you will unite sincerely with Peking University colleagues

625
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,640
to run "New Youth",

626
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,880
leading the trend of history to carry forth a new generation.

627
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,400
Master Cai can rest assured that our generation will forge ahead.

628
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,520
I'll just do a good job

629
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,200
by giving you some advice.

630
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,640
The vanguard of the movement depends on Shouchang,

631
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
Shizhi,

632
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
and Zhou Shuren.

633
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,160
Zhou Shuren is an

634
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,640
incredible leader.

635
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,240
Master Cai, Master Cai.

636
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
We thought of the same thing.

637
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,880
So, have you all agreed

638
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
what classes Shizhi will teach next semester?

639
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,080
I--

640
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,720
Sir, the first course I want to teach is

641
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
history of Chinese philosophy.

642
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,920
This is a little out of my expectation.

643
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,000
Everyone wants you to teach Chinese literature.

644
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
That's above my expectation.

645
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,600
Gentlemen, I think so too.

646
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,440
I think there is a misunderstanding

647
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
about the New Culture Movement

648
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,800
at home and overseas.

649
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,640
I think that the New Culture Movement

650
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,280
is a complete negation of Chinese traditional culture.

651
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
In fact, New Culture

652
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,160
is created within the strong protection of traditional culture.

653
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,120
So,

654
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,920
I want to make a systematic review

655
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
of the development of Chinese ideology and culture

656
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,880
to help everyone clarify the relationship between the two.

657
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,880
This is also the content of my doctoral thesis.

658
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,720
Well said.

659
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,480
Very well put.

660
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,080
I agree.

661
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,040
There is one more thing I want to explain to Mr. Cai.

662
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,760
Go ahead.

663
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
My doctoral thesis failed in the first round.

664
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,240
I'm making further amendments

665
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,800
under Dewey's supervision

666
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
and trying to pass the next round.

667
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,880
I know this,

668
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
so don't emphasize it deliberately.

669
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,560
Well, since ancient times, men have hated each other,

670
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,520
but what they have always loved is Erguotou.

671
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,600

There isn't any.

687

You see what kind of list this is?

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,920
Hu Shi, that yellow-haired child, is on the list.

689
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,160
I came behind last.

690
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
What's wrong with this?

691
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,520
Peking University treats several masters of Chinese culture like this.

692
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,200
We refuse to accept!

693
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,560
Yeah! We refuse!

Way out of line!

696
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,920
That's not possible!

697
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,640
Yeah!

698

What the hell is this?

This gentleman can't shut his mouth.

705

I have to ask Mr. Cai for an explanation.

706

If it's serious, go back to that lousy temple.

707

Let's go.

708

709

711

Besides, I don't want to go back to that lousy temple.

You should go back to that lousy temple!

713

How unusual for the two of you to come to me

714

full of disapproval and complaint.

715
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,240
Alright. How have you been wronged?

I, Yuanpei, will make it right for you.

717

Mr. Cai, if I may ask,

718
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
how was the list of committee members

719
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,400
on the school appraisal council produced?

720
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,400
Ah, so it is this matter.

721
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
I will explain.

722
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,920
After the Zhang Xun Restoration incident,

723
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,760
I was requested by the Ministry of Education

724
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,920
to readjust the school appraisal committee membership

725
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,880
based on fluctuations in the number of qualified teaching staff.

[Gu Hongming, born Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

728
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
So based on the ministry's request

729
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,240
the school council, after much deliberation,

730
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
have now put together a list of candidates

731
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,800
for public feedback.

732
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,520
I suppose you both have already seen it.

733
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,960
What do you think? Please speak your mind.

734
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,040
I recall Mr. Cai once stated

735
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,560
academic performance

736
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,440
shall be the basis of professorial appointments at Peking University.

737
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,320
In light of this standard, we both believe

738
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,480
there is a high proportion of chaff on the

739
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,720
proposed list of candidates for the appraisal committee.

740
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,760
Master Cai, such an appraisal committee

741
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,160
would destroy the reputation of Peking University.

742
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,760
Mr. Huang Kan, please elaborate.

743
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,840
What sort of person is that Hu Shi?

744
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,560
He is merely a student who has just graduated.

745
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,000
Peking University is China's highest institution of learning.

746
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,880
How could it possibly

747
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
need a youth who can only sing a few farfetched nursery rhymes

748
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
on the appraisal committee?

749
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Master Cai, allow me to be blunt.

750
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,280
If all Hu Shi needs to do is say a few words of vernacular Chinese,

751
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,640
speak a few foreign words

752
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,160
to become a professor, become a member of the appraisal committee,

753
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,400
then let's not bother calling our Peking University as such any longer.

754
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,360
It might as well be the University of Vernacular Chinese.

755
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,000
That's right.

756
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,600
Hu Shi

757
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,160
is an outstanding student from Columbia University.

758
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,760
A young talent recommended 

759
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,240
to Peking University from overseas.

760
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,160
Though he is young,

761
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,000
he has published extensively

762
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,240
and has impeccable academic credentials.

763
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,040
Amongst the younger students, he is very influential.

764
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,840
So to choose him for the appraisal committee

765
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
also boosts the moral of the younger students. 

766
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
So that reforms will more strongly take root.

767
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Master Cai, I myself studied abroad as a youth in England,

768
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,000
I was awarded a Master's degree in literature from the University of Edinburgh at the age of twenty.

769
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,160
I am proficient in nine foreign languages.

770
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
If I'm not even qualified to be

771
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,040
an appraisal committee member,

772
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,880
then how could Hu Shi, newly returned and without any achievements,

773
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,440
possibly deserve his position?

774
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,560
It is true that you are world renowned.

775
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,360
But you abetted the Zhang Xun Restoration,

776
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,240
which has already aroused much popular indignation and anger.

777
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,600
Furthermore, there are many joint letters from students and teachers

778
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,360
calling for the removal of your teaching position.

779
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,160
Do you think it's appropriate

780
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,360
for you to be on the appraisal committee

781
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,960
at such a time?

782
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,160
Mr. Cai, haven't you always emphasized

783
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,160
that the most important standard at Peking University

784
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,280
is academic ability?

785
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,280
If we are judging on the basis of political orientation,

786
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,120
while I, Huang Kan, was waging revolution,

787
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
what was Hu Shi even doing?

788
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,520
I really do take professional ability very seriously.

789
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
However, the country has certain stipulations.

790
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,280
This reselection of appraisal committee members

791
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,120
must abide by the clear cut policies set by the Ministry of Education.

792
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,720
One of which is that the appraisal committee members

793
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
in terms of politics, must support republicanism.

794
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,080
Another, that teachers must have favourable personal attributes.

795
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,440
A third, that must be representatives from different administrative levels, and so on.

796
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,000
Which is why you two experts were not chosen.

797
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,680
I probably don't need to list

798
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,560
the specific reasons one by one.

799
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,160
I know the two of you are somewhat prejudiced

800
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,840
against Hu Shi.

801
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,120
To be quite honest, I had the same impression.

802
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,840
But after I met Hu Shi,

803
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,440
and conversed with him,

804
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,520
his reasoning and his views

805
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,400
dispelled my misgivings.

806
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,280
Hu Shi is, after all,

807
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,280
a representative of new culture.

808
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,200
Besides, Hu Shi is a brilliant student

809
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
of the American master of pragmatism, John Dewey.

810
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,120
It has extensive influence

811
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,960
amongst many students.

812
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,360
I am planning to ask Hu Shi

813
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,800
to prepare a lecture for us at Peking University.

814
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
I invite both experts to attend.

815
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
The level of his abilities

816
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,400
will be clear upon listening.

817
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,240
Alright. When the time comes I will be certain to sing his praises.

818
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,520
Great.

819
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,520
Mind your step.

820
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,040
Come over here.

821
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,960
Hurry and find Mr. Hu Shi.

822
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,480
Tell him to see me.

823
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
I have to talk to him.

824
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,040
Alright.

825
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,120
Please sit.

826
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Esteemed collegues,

827
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,120
Zhang Xun does his restoration and Peking University is rocked by an earthquake.

828
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,920
For over three months

829
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
my students at Peking University

830
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,560
was unable to focus on learning, on studying.

831
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,560
For over three months

832
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,080
my teaching staff at Peking University

833
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,520
was unable to use their energy on teaching, on giving classes.

834
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,760
For over three months

835
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,520
my collegues at Peking University

836
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,480
were unable to pursue their studies in peace.

837
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,520
The very thought of it causes grief.

838
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,080
Some have asked me, with all this turmoil,

839
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,400
what is Peking University to do?

840
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,120
What is the fate of new culture?

841
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,160
Today, we've finally re-opened the school.

842
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,880
On the occasional of today's opening ceremony,

843
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,000
I have eight words for everyone present.

844
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,720
Our original intent is immovable, our commitment unwavering.

845
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,160
A few days ago, Dr. Hu Shi came to Peking Univerity.

846
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,360
He gave me an essay

847
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,200
that he published when he was in the United States.

848
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,400
Its title is "Against Studying Abroad."

849
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,920
Its topic is on the question

850
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
of how universities pursue knowledge.

851
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,240
I was very stimulated by reading it.

852
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,120
Therefore, I've changed things up

853
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,640
for today's opening ceremony.

854
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,800
I've invited Dr. Hu Shi

855
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
to give us a lecture.

856
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,040
Its title is

857
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,880
"The Relationship Between The University and Chinese Higher Learning"

858
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,080
We invite Dr. Hu Shi to come onstage.

859
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,240
You shall know the difference

860
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,960
now that we are back again.

861
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,560
This is a quote

862
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,320
from the epics of Homer.

863
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,960
It means "Now that we are back again

864
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,960
you shall know the difference."

865
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,480
What? What does this mean?

866
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,200
I believe that these words also represent

867
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,240
what every scholar at Peking University feels at this very moment.

868
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,520
A noble king ought also listen to the opinions of others

869
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,120
and proceed with caution.

870
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,480
I give you a piece of advice.

871
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,160
Do not forget it.

872
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,000
I'd like to ask Dr. Hu Shi what I've just said.

873
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,800
Apologies, sir.

874
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,560
I truly do not understand what you said.

875
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,920
I just recited Homer

876
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,240
in the original Greek.

877
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,520
The meaning in Chinese is

878
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,000
A noble king ought also listen to the opinions of others

879
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
and proceed with caution.

880
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
I give you a piece of advice.

881
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,880
Do not forget it.

882
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,880
It is forgivable

883
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,680
that Dr. Hu Shi doesn't understand Greek

884
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
and recites Ancient Greek poetry in English.

885
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,400
But if ancient Greek poetry is to be recited in English

886
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,720
it ought to be the pure English

887
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
of a London gentleman.

888
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,920
Your pronunciation is far too inept.

889
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,800
Entirely that of a commoner.

890
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,280
A proper London gentleman sounds like this.

891
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,080
You shall know the difference

892
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
now that we are back again.

893
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,720
Ok?

894
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,920
Wonderful!

895
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,200
This must be

896
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,360
the illustrious Mr. Gu Hongming.

897
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,840
To have received your instruction at our first meeting

898
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
is a great honour.

899
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,320
I am vey thankful for Mr. Gu's correction

900
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,880
of my English pronunciation.

901
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,560
But today

902
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,800
I use this quote from Homer

903
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
without regard for its language, its pronunciation, its tone.

904
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
I don't care whether it is said

905
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,080
in proper London English

906
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,920
or with the pronunciation of a commoner.

907
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,280
What I care about is

908
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
the meaning it conveys.

909
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Now that we are back,

910
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,440
you shall know the difference.

911
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,360
This statement is also what I wish to deliver to you.

912
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,120
This statement...

913
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
is what I wish to deliver to everyone sitting here as well.

914
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,720
This is a statement from us at Peking University

915
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,400
