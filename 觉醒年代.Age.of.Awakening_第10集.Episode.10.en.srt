00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
Let's go to the academic affairs office

448
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,960
with Hu Shi first.

449
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,000
Zhongxia, Xingang.

450
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,880
Ask some students

451
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,840
to bring tools

452
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,720
to the Nanchizi

453
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,400
single teachers dormitories.

454
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,440
Help Mr. Shizhi

455
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
tidy up his room.

456
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,480
Yes, let's go.

457
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,320
Come, let's work together.

458
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,960
Shizhi.

459
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,120
We've met at last.

460
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,040
Shizhi, come.

461
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,560
Come.

462
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,772
Sit on the chair.

463
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:40,767
Sit on the chair.

464
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,520
Thank you.

465
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,320
Enjoy your meal, gentlemen.

466
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
I can't see you clearly when I sit across.

467
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,400
I've been looking forward to you for half a year.

468
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,280
I finally got my wish to see you.

469
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,240
Have you tried lamb hotpot?

470
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,960
Lamb hotpot.

471
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,640
Not used to moving places.

472
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,880
Quanjude roast duck.

473
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's go, we're going now.

474
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,200
Sir, sir.

475
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
Lamb hotpot is great. I like it.

476
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
I can't eat it abroad.

477
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,717
Like it?

478
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:48,048
I like it.

479
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
If you like it, you can sit down.

480
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,720
Sit down, sir.

481
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,880
What wine would you like to drink?

482
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,480
Erguotou.

483
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,760
Pretty good.

484
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,480
Good.

485
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Since ancient times, men have hated each other,

486
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
but they have always loved Erguotou.

487
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,720
I'll pour it for you.

488
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,520
I'll do it, sir.

489
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,880
Let me mix the seasoning for you.

490
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,000
Alright.

491
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
When eating lamb hotpot,

492
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
the seasoning comes first.

493
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,960
I only learned it after I came to Beijing.

494
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
I'll do it, sir.

495
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,480
No, no, you can't.

496
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,520
This salty taste is very particular.

497
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
Sir, that's very kind.

498
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
I, Chen Duxiu, while spending half my life wandering,

499
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
have met quite a few scholars,

500
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
but most have little reputation,

501
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
and only my good brother makes me feel inferior.

502
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,040
Several passages in the article "A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform"

503
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
are like mountains and rivers.

504
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,160
It often makes me feel relaxed, humiliated and forgotten,

505
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,120
and I am not afraid of your jokes.

506
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
Every time I write to you,

507
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,520
it reminds me of the Boya and Ziqi friends.

508
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
Thank you, sir.

509
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,760
Come and taste the salty taste.

510
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
You can add sesame paste if you feel it.

511
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
When it's light, you can add chive.

512
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,680
Small bites, small bites.

513
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,209
Perfect.

514
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:34,897
Perfect.

515
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:35,840
Good.

516
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,440
Come, eat some meat.

517
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
Sir.

518
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Would you like some?

519
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,280
Give me some.

520
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,320
I wish you had already come.

521
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
"New Youth"

522
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
would have been given to you and Shouchang.

523
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
Honestly, New Culture in China

524
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
is only be seen in its infancy.

525
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,800
It may break at any time.

526
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
Plus, Peking University is a complex place

527
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,320
where all kinds of political thought agitate each other.

528
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
You should have enough mental preparation.

529
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
Sir, you mentioned Shouchang,

530
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,160
he's from Hebei.

531
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,360
Li Dazhao.

532
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
I believe that although you have never met,

533
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
you must become instant friends,

534
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,280
because I often dream

535
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
that the three of us are together.

536
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
You also dreamed that the three of us were together.

537
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,360
Yes, more than once.

538
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
That's an extraordinary insight.

539
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
Chivalrous, generous and elegiac people.

540
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,920
I often see the three of us in my dreams

541
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,240
working together on "New Youth".

542
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
I also believe that the three of us

543
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,120
will definitely push forward the New Culture Movement.

544
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,160
Good.

545
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
For New Culture.

546
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
For your ideals.

547
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
Hu Shi is willing to do his part.

548
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,800
Sir.

549
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
I believe in one of your sayings.

550
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,360
"I won't talk about politics for twenty years

551
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,760
but dedicate oneself to developing the enlightenment of people's wisdom."

552
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,600
This is the way to save the nation.

553
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,120
To you.

554
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,640
Good.

555
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,560
Have ambition,

556
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,200
But this can't be done

557
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,400
by just saying a few words.

558
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,680
It's hard to not talk about politics for twenty years.

559
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,000
The Zhang Xun Restoration

560
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,160
has had tremenduous consequences.

561
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,360
If he had really succeeded this time,

562
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,840
then "New Youth", New Culture,

563
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,680
would have all been rejected.

564
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
Honestly, sir,

565
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
before returning home this time, my heart

566
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,640
had always been uneasy.

567
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
Until seeing you today,

568
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,360
this stone in my heart

569
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,440
fell to the ground.

570
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Hmm.

571
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,920
Thank you, sir, for your encouragement and support.

572
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,840
Be kind to me, sir.

573
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,680
Hu Shi has nothing to offer in return.

574
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,560
I am willing to follow you.

575
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,280
I made up my mind when I returned home.

576
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,560
I have neither complaint nor regret.

577
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,440
I will be a Huizhou camel to carry forward New Culture.

578
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,760
Good.

579
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,720
A Huizhou camel.

580
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,560
Well put.

581
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,400
Here.

582
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
Then let us two Huizhou camels follow the local customs

583
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,560
according to the old saying in Beijing.

584
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,884
Cheers.

585
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:44,831
Cheers.

586
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,520
Mr. Cai.

587
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,320
Hello.

588
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,720
Mr. Cai.

589
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,040
Hello.

590
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,640
Mr. Cai.

591
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,520
You're came.

592
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,880
Hello, shopkeeper Li.

593
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,640
I--

594
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,160
I-- I would like to meet my collegues.

595
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
This way, please.

596
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,560
Shizhi.

597
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,760
Mr. Cai came to see you.

598
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:22,800
Sir.

599
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,680
Please sit down.

600
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Waiter, another pair of chopsticks!

601
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,200
Got it!

602
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Hello, sir.

603
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,240
Zhongfu.

604
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,520
I heard that there were two rabbits eating grass beside their burrow.

605
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
This old rabbit came here.

606
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,880
I'll order a large dish.

607
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,360
You won't object, will you?

608
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
Come, sir, Shizhi.

609
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,640
Sit down and chat.

610
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,440
Alright.

611
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,680
I saw you two when I came here just now.

612
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
You were elated.

613
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,240
What were you talking about?

614
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,320
I and Shizhi were talking about

615
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,880
New Culture and "New Youth".

616
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,640
The New Culture Movement is rising.

617
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,080
Every step, walking on thin ice.

618
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,600
Between you two,

619
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
one is the master,

620
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,480
the other is the pioneer.

621
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,320
What a perfect match.

622
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,680
Come.

623
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,280
I hope you will unite sincerely with Peking University colleagues

624
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,640
to run "New Youth",

625
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,880
leading the trend of history to carry forth a new generation.

626
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,400
Master Cai can rest assured that our generation should forge ahead.

627
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,520
I'll just do a good job

628
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,200
by giving you a service.

629
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,640
The charge depends on Shouchang,

630
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
Shizhi,

631
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
and Zhou Shuren.

632
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,160
Zhou Shuren is an

633
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,640
incredible leader.

634
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,240
Master Cai, Master Cai.

635
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
We thought of the same thing.

636
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,880
So, have you all agreed

637
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
what classes Shizhi will teach next semester?

638
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,080
I--

639
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,720
Sir, the first course I want to teach is

640
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
history of Chinese philosophy.

641
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,920
This is a little out of my expectation.

642
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,000
Everyone wants you to teach Chinese literature.

643
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
That's a high expectation.

644
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,600
Gentlemen, I think so too.

645
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,440
I think there is a misunderstanding

646
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
about the New Culture Movement

647
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,800
at home and abroad.

648
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,640
I think that the New Culture Movement

649
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,280
is a complete negation of Chinese traditional culture.

650
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
In fact, New Culture

651
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,160
is created within the strong protection of traditional culture.

652
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,120
So,

653
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,920
I want to make a systematic review

654
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
of the development of Chinese ideology and culture

655
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,880
to help everyone clarify the relationship between the two.

656
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,880
This is also the content of my doctoral thesis.

657
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,720
Well said.

658
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,480
Very well put.

659
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,080
I agree.

660
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,040
There is one more thing I want to explain to Mr. Cai.

661
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,760
Go ahead.

662
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
My doctoral thesis failed in the first round.

663
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,240
I'm making further amendments

664
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,800
under Dewey's supervision

665
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
and trying to pass the next round.

666
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,880
I know this,

667
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
so don't emphasize it deliberately.

668
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,560
Well, since ancient times, men have hated each other,

669
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,520
but what they have always loved is Erguotou.

670
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,600
Another pot!

671
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,440
List of candidates for the school appraisal committee.

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,120

674
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,080

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Ma Yinchu, Hu Shi.

678
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,480
Hello professor.

679
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,360
Hello sir.

680
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,240
Liu Wendian.

681
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,480
Hello sir. Hello sir.

682
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,988
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Professor at Peking University]

683
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,400
What's the reason?

684
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,160
There isn't any.

685
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,880
Brother Shenshu.

686
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,640
You see what kind of charter this is?

687
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,920
Hu Shi, that yellow-haired child, is on the list.

688
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,160
I came behind last.

689
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
What's wrong with this?

690
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,520
Peking University treats several masters of Chinese culture like this.

691
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,200
We refuse to accept!

692
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,560
Yeah! We refuse!

693
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,440
Injustice!

694
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,080
Way out of line!

695
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,920
That's not possible!

696
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,640
Yeah!

697
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,160
What the hell is this?

698
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,600
They still have the final say later on.

699
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,800
Yeah!

700
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,600
None of them!

701
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,720
Brother Shenshu.

702
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,160
What-- What's reason for this?

703
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
This gentleman can't shut his mouth.

704
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,680
I have to ask Mr. Cai for an explanation.

705
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,920
If it's serious, go back to that ruined temple.

706
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,720
Let's go.

707
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,680
Jigang, I'm a sick seed.

708
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,640
I'm still in peace when I'm not on the committee.

709
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,600
Shenshu!

710
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,920
Besides, I don't want to go back to that ruined temple.

711
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,760


712
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,800


713
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,440


714
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,240
