There's also

6
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,640
a Japan that's waiting behind you.

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,240
Brother Zhongfu, what do you think?

8
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,760
I agree with Shizhi.

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
I have studied a lot of Wilson's speeches.

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
I think he is a virtuous man.

11
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,320
He made two suggestions.

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,360
One, no country is allowed to use power

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,200
to infringe upon the equality and freedom of other countries.

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,240
Two, governments of all countries are not allowed to use power

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
to infringe upon the equality and freedom of the people.

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,600
I thought about it for some time,

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,960
as long as you do these two things,

[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

19
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,120
then justice must triumph over power.

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,320
So I plan

21
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,520
to write an article in the next issue

22
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,480

25
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
Shouchang, can you also write about the Paris Peace Conference?

26
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,120
But I'm not that interested in America.

27
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,320
You know what?

28
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Let me write an article about the October Revolution in Russia.

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,440
That can also do.

30
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,120
Shizhi, you?

31
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360

32
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,720
I've been too busy recently.

33
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,160
Which one of us is the busiest?

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:00,960
You.

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,320
You. It has to be.

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,760
No.

37
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,120
I think it's Shizhi.

38
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,040
Why?

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,360
Because he works hard every day

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,440
and has to go to bed at ten o'clock at night.

41
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,600
Otherwise his dear wife

42
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,800
won't let him in.

43

Come on in.

I'm really impressed with you.

Shiyan,

47
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,520
can all these books be sold?

48
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,440
Brother Ge said that in Changxindian

49
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,160
there are thousands of people.

50
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,440
Maybe it's not enough to sell.

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
I also bought some

52
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,000
new magazines and newspapers.

53
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,840
Sure enough, everyone is

54
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,880
paying attention to this Wilson now.

55
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,160
Even Liang Qichao

56
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,160
also wrote an article called "League of Nations and China",

57
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
saying that Wilson's League of Nations

58
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
is the best means to realize a harmonious world.

59
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,040
Didn't Mr. Shouchang write

60
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,160
two articles about Russia?

61
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,440
"New Era" and "Victory of Bolshevism".

62
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,400
I bought them, too.

63
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
But it seems that now everyone

64
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,200
is paying more attention to Wilson.

69

When it comes to violent revolution,

70
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
it's like seeing the plague.

71
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,080
Think about it. Since ancient times,

72
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,520
which reactionary regime

73
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
has withdrawn from the historical stage by itself since ancient times?

74
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,920
Since ancient times, which violent revolution

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
shed no blood?

76
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,640

79
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,120
Didn't the October Revolution in Russia

80
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
overthrow the reactionaries

81
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,360
and establish people's power?

82
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,960
Can ordinary people live a good life?

83
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,880
How do you know that the Russian people

84
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,920
are living a good life now?

85

go to the Changxindian factory for research and investigation.

Would you say that there is anyone busier than you?

183
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
Not the Marquez Society.

184
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,080
It's the Marx Society.

185
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,560
I remember it was the Marquez Society.

186
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
It's Marx.

187
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,240
Mr. Wang deliberately called it Marquez.

188
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
Not Marx.

189
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,880
Just to make others think that we

190
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,280
are a society that studies Malthusian population theory.

191
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,040
So we won't get into trouble with the authorities.

192
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:05,115
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

193
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,200
Marxist research will cause trouble.

194
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,280
During this time, I read some Marx's books

195
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
here with Mr. Dazhao,

196
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,840
and I was deeply inspired.

197
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,800
Nice!

198
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,000
It's time to start

199
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
read Marxist books consciously.

200
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,720
Students, in the future, our reading club

201
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
will focus on recommending

202
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
and letting everyone read more books on Marxism.

203
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,960
Mr. Shouchang.

204
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,480
Mr. Shouchang.

205
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,000
Sir.

206
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,480
Runzhi and I want to ask you something.

207
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,000
Go on.

208
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,520
Here's the thing, Mr. Shouchang.

209
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:36,634
[Mao Zedong, styled Runzhi, Peking University Library Assistant]

210
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
I just received a letter from Hunan.

211
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
I think this letter is particularly reasonable.

212
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
So I wanted to come and discuss a solution with you.

213
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
Please have a look, sir.

214
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
My friend Xiong Guangchu

215
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
is a member of the Xinmin Society.

216
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,160
In his letter,

217
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
he suggested that teachers and students of various colleges and universities

218
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,160
should first promote the establishment of reading rooms

219
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,760
in towns and villages all over the country,

220
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
so as to publicize New Culture and advanced ideas

221
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
to the people all over the country

222
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
and gradually improve people's quality.

223
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,720
Sir,

224
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
I think Runzhi's suggestion is particularly good.

225
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,640
At present, the enlightenment of New Culture thought

226
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,164
[Deng Zhongxia, styled Zhonghao, Student at Peking University]

227
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,720
is mainly among students and young people.

228
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,360
If we can gradually improve people's quality

229
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,120
and publicize new ideas and culture

230
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
by setting up reading rooms,

231
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,960
this would be a wonderful thing.

232
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,400
The suggestion is good.

233
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
But it's not easy to set up reading rooms

234
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,960
in all towns and villages across the country.

235
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,680
Mr. Shouchang, at least

236
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
someone needs to come out and take the lead.

237
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,280
This is a good suggestion

238
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
for New Culture to go public.

239
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,320
But this proposal

240
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
will consume a lot of manpower and financial resources.

241
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,120
The key, Runzhi, is, as you said,

242
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,200
who will take the lead?

243
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
Runzhi's suggestion is

244
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
our Peking University will take the lead.

245
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,520
Spreading New Culture is the responsibility of Peking University.

246
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,200
But this thing,

247
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
you should report it to Mr. Cai.

248
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,400
Let him decide.

249
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
OK, I'll write to Mr. Cai now.

250
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,320
Good.

251
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,000
Sir.

252
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,960
Fellow students.

253
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,040
I've been thinking about a problem recently.

254
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,320
Our reading club

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
cannot simply stop at ideological confrontation.

256
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
More importantly,

257
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,840
we combine truth with practice.

258
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,280
So I have an initiative.

259
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,680
We will set up a work-study mutual aid society.

260
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,600
We will form a mutual aid group

261
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,680
according to the theory of mutual aid

262
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,160
to experiment with mutual assistance communism.

263
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,760
I wonder if you agree.

264
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,160
Yannian, Wang Guangqi mentioned

265
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
your idea before.

266
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,360
I think there is nothing wrong in theory.

267
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
But will the actual operation

268
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,400
be difficult?

269
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
I discussed this problem with him.

270
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
He wants to make this operation big.

271
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
But it will also be difficult.

272
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
I just want to do a small-scale experiment first,

273
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
and just try it out in our reading club

274
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,640
and French study hall.

275
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,400
Today, I will just make an initiative first.

276
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
If everyone thinks it's feasible,

277
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,000
then I'll go back to draft the articles of association immediately.

278
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
He's advocating such a thing.

279
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,440
He did a good job.

280
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Like this, also like that.

281
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,760
I think it's pretty good.

282
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,960
I'm willing to have a try.

283
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,280
Right.

284
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
I think this Yannian's initiative

285
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,520
is a very good combination of theory and practice.

286
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,480
I have an initiative.

287
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,440
Please.

288
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
I think New Culture must be combined

289
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
with the workers and peasants in order to reach the masses.

290
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,520
I did research in Changxindian a while ago

291
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,720
and also learned a lot.

292
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,560
Changxindian has nearly 4,000 workers.

293
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
The workers work long hours

294
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,280
and paid low salaries.

295
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
Everyone works ten hours every summer,

296
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,280
and work about eleven to twelve hours in winter.

297
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,400
But the wages only range from three cents to one yuan.

298
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
Many workers work all day

299
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
without food and clothing.

300
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,040
What surprises me even more is

301
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
the number of illiterate workers.

302
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,240
We took two hundred copies of New Youth.

303
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
Not even the last half was sold.

304
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
I really think we don't know much

305
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,800
about this group.

306
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,480
Therefore, Zhongxie and I are going to organize

307
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,600
a lecture group on civilian education,

308
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
taking Changxindian as a pilot to give a series of lectures

309
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
and conduct in-depth investigation.

310
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,120
Shiyan is absolutely right.

311
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
I think research and lectures

312
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,280
should be combined.

313
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,800
This form of lectures

314
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
may be even more urgent for civilians,

315
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,840
because there are few civilians who can read now.

316
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,320
There are even less who can read publications

317
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,040
and printed material.

318
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,880
So if you want to carry out universal education,

319
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,960
you have to start with lectures.

320
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
And I think

321
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
the organizational form of this lecture group on civilian education

322
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,840
doesn't have to be complicated.

323
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,200
A few people

324
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
can prepare a topic in advance for a group

325
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,840
and go to a crowded place

326
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,120
such as a temple fair to give a speech.

327
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,000
Right.

328
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,440
The topic doesn't have to be complicated.

329
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,360
We start with general knowledge and current affairs.

330
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,560
We should let

331
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
ordinary poor workers and civilians

332
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,960
know some current affairs

333
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,080
and general knowledge,

334
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
and then realize their status

335
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,280
and the source of social diseases.

336
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,360
Getting them to do something positive

337
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,120
will not achieve our goal.

338
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
I have spent every day in Changsha

339
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,280
among ordinary people over the years.

340
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,320
Their suffering.

341
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,440
Their joy.

342
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
I feel the same way more or less.

343
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,560
And

344
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,880
I have a better understanding of what they really want.

345
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
So, I couldn't agree more

346
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
to Shiyan's and Yannian's proposals.

347
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,520
I want to join

348
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,280
both societies.

349
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
I want to join.

350
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,000
I want to join.

351
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,520
Yannian.

352
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,720
You asked me just now.

353
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,160
What do you think of your proposal?

354
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
I want to applaud you and Shiyan.

355
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,960
Students.

356
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,520
Why should I applaud these two students?

357
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Because these two students

358
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
all saw a problem.

359
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
That is, theory and practice should be combined.

360
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
As we said at the rally,

361
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,200
celebrating the victory in the war in Europe,

362
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,800
the New Culture Movement

363
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
has now reached a turning point.

364
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,800
That turning point is that the New Culture Movement

365
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,120
is going to the public.

366
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,720
Zhongxie,

367
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Mr. Cai replied to the letter.

368
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
What did Mr. Cai say?

369
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,240
Mr. Cai fully supports it

370
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,920
and urges us all

371
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,600
to go out as soon as possible.

372
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I have just listened to your classmates' speeches.

373
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,120
I am both excited and admired.

374
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,800
Excited

375
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
to see everyone's insights.

376
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,640
Admired

377
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,040
to see everyone's pioneering spirit.

378
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
You choose to go out.

379
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
That means giving up a lot.

380
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,000
It means that you have chosen a difficult road,

381
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,400
and given up a comfortable road like Shizhi.

382
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,360
It means that you have chosen a pioneering road

383
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,080
and given up a safe road.

384
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,400
It means that you have chosen

385
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,880
the road to struggle against difficulties,

386
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,040
and given up the comfortable road of sitting around and talking.

387
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,240
Students,

388
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
we are going out of the study halls

389
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,080
to the grass-roots.

390
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,600
I know this road is hard and bitter.

391
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
But I firmly believe,

392
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
no matter how difficult or bitter the road is,

393
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,400
you cannot be beaten,

394
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,040
because I saw everyone's courage.

395
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,880
Students, I sincerely hope that everyone

396
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,440
be able to step on the dirt with both feet,

397
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
and walk

398
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,120
every step of the way

399
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,880
step by step.

400
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
And I believe that victory will definitely belong to us

401
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,800
because we're already on our way.

402
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
Hurrah!

403
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
Hurrah!

404
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,040
Let's solve a problem.

405
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
We must first know the essence of this problem.

406
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,840
Then this is the purpose of going to the grass-roots.

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Today, Shugui helped us

408
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,880
make an appointment with many workers' representatives.

409
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,320
Be sure to ask questions.

410
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Only when there are problems will there be knowledge.

411
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Sir, Mr. Shouchang.

412
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,000
Sir.

413
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,200
Runzhi. Zhongxie.

414
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
Mr. Shouchang.

415
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,400
Come, Runzhi.

416
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll ask Zhongxie to call you here.

417
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,480
I want to invite you to participate in our activities in Peking University.

418
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm not bothering you, am I?

419
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,720
Not at all.

420
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,480
How long has Runzhi been in Beijing?

421
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,920
It's been more than half a year.

422
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,120
Have you ever been to Changxindian?

423
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
I've been there with Zhongxie and Zhao Shiyan.

424
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,480
But they were all short visits.

425
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
It's a rare opportunity to know that you are going

426
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,240
to do special research this time.

427
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
I can also get a closer look

428
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,280
of the state of workers here.

429
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,400
Marx said

430
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,840
the industrial working class

431
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,840
is the most advanced class in the world.

432
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
But is this sentence

433
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,920
in line with China's reality?

434
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
I think it's a real problem.

435
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
We have been to Changxindian several times before.

436
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,400
I think Marx has a point.

437
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,800
Does he?

438
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
Let's experience that with our own hearts.

439
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,440
You are in charge of recording today.

440
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,400
Very well.

441
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,589
[Changxindian workers' dormitories]

442
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,200
This is for the guests.

443
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,080
Go play.

444
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,560
Please come in, please.

445
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,920
Everyone.

446
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
This is the one I always tell you about.

447
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,840
Professor Li Dazhao of Peking University.

448
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,600
Hello, masters.

449
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,320
These gentlemen

450
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,920
are Professor Li's students.

451
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,200
Mr. Dazhao, sit down.

452
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,920
Sit, sit.

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Excuse me, masters.

454
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
Sit inside, sit inside.

455
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,760
Help yourself.

456
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,040
Thank you.

457
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,000
You're welcome.

458
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,560
You're so kind.

459
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,360
Sit down, sit down.

460
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,640
Professor Li, they came here

461
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
just to ask us

462
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,520
if we have any difficulties

463
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,880
to chat with us.

464
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,280
Professor Li, these

465
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,960
are the old workers on our railway.

466
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
Please feel free to ask if you have any questions.

467
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,440
Good.

468
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,440
Hello, masters.

469
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,400
Hello.

470
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,280
Give this to the gentleman.

471
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,120
Actually, we're here

472
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
just to talk to the masters.

473
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,360
Just to chit-chat.

474
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,200
Everyone knows that

475
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
this world war is over.

476
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,440
China, on the other hand, has become a victorious country.

477
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,400
But how did our China

478
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
become a victorious country?

479
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
That's because China

480
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,760
sent several hundreds of thousands of workers

481
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,440
to the European battlefield.

482
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,200
Because of these workers,

483
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,000
with their own blood, sweat, and life,

484
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
won honour

485
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
for our country.

486
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
Personally, I also think

487
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,840
that our Chinese workers

488
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
are the most hardworking people in the world,

489
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,480
the greatest workers in the world,

490
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,960
who should be widely respected by society.

491
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,920
Professor Li.

492
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,760
Ah, you're too kind.

493
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
If you have any questions, just ask.

494
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,440
We don't have anything to hide.

495
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,400
Okay, okay, okay.

496
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,960
I want to ask you a question first.

497
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,680
What specific jobs are you engaged in?

498
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,200
Changxindian locomotives and rolling stock factories

499
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,360
were an early modern industry in China,

500
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
and were one of the important breeding grounds

501
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,600
of China's early industrial workforce.

502
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,760
After the October Revolution in Russia,

503
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,960
Chinese pioneers began to realize

504
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,440
the great power of the working class.

505
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,840
In March 1919,

506
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
under the guidance of Li Dazhao,

507
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,200
Deng Zhongxia organized and established a lecture group

508
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,200
on civilian education in Peking University,

509
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,760
and began to give lectures in Changxindian.

510
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,040
In the process of integrating with the working masses,

511
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,120
a group of intellectuals

512
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,320
such as Li Dazhao and Deng Zhongxia,

513
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,840
who initially came into contact with Marxism,

514
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,800
further changed their thoughts and feelings

515
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,160
to the working class.

516
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
At the same time, some workers such as Ge Shugui,

517
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
thanks to the education of Marxism-Leninism,

518
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
promoted class consciousness

519
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,600
and became advanced members of the working class.

520
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
Shiyan, do you know anything about the countryside?

521
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
My family have always been in cities, where I've studied since childhood.

522
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,120
I really don't know much about the countryside.

523
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
I think in our country,

524
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
workers live like farmers.

525
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,880
There's not much difference.

526
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,920
How can you see it that way?

527
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,160
I think if I want to understand China,

528
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,520
we first of all must understand farmers.

529
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,160
Mr. Shouchang.

530
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
I have a question I want to ask you.

531
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,080
Go on.

532
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,440
I've always thought

533
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,080
that the image of industrial workers in our country is particularly high.

534
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,280
But why

535
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
are their lives so hard?

536
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
This is the difference between China's national conditions

537
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
and those of Japan and even Europe.

538
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
Although I have never been abroad, I know

539
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
that there is no comparison between our country's level of industrialization

540
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
and theirs.

541
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,240
In the European revolutions,

542
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,560
the working class is at the center.

543
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,000
For example, the Paris Commune

544
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
and the Russian October Revolution

545
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,120
are centered around the working class

546
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,720
in the city centers.

547
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,800
The working class in Europe

548
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,280
is the most conscious, the most disciplined,

549
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,800
and most united class.

550
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,640
I think the workers in our country are not simple either.

551
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
Although they are not highly educated,

552
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,400
life is also hard.

553
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,840
But they are still very concerned

554
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,640
about our country.

555
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,200
Some of their words touched me very much today.

556
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,760
It's raining.

557
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,160
Let's go to the tea shop in front to take shelter from the rain.

558
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,600
Ok.

559
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,040
Xiaoshan, let's find shelter from the rain.

560
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,760
Yes, sir.

561
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,720
Hurry up, hurry up!

562
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,040
What heavy rain!

563
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,240
Boss, bring us a pot of tea.

564
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,640
How many people.

565
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:14,960
Five people.

566
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,520
Okay, okay, okay.

567
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,720
Xiaoshan, come in for shelter when you're finished.

568
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,600
Yes, sir.

569
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,200
Come, sir, please.

570
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,520
Zhongxie.

571
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
Actually, I just felt the same way as you.

572
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
Our country just has

573
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,120
too little workers.

574
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
And what I didn't expect was that

575
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
there were also so many workers who used to be bankrupt farmers.

576
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,760
Their lifestyle has changed,

577
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,200
but their livelihoods

578
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,240
haven't changed at all.

579
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
Some people are even worse than before.

580
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,440
So their mode of thinking and way of thinking

581
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
are the same as before. It doesn't make much difference.

582
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,840
I think for a real revolution,

583
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
we first of all should start with farmers.

584
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
Runzhi, that's a good question.

585
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
I think we should find a way out for China.

586
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
This problem should be studied.

587
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,000
Zhongxie, our Marxist Research Society

588
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,120
will study this problem.

589
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,760
Sir, there's one more thing that shocked me today.

590
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
It's that the number of illiterate workers in Changxindian

591
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,720
is beyond my imagination.

592
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,760
I remembered the letter from Xiong Guangchu.

593
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,680
His letter mentioned

594
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,880
that it's very important to talk about civilian education.

595
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,080
So I think

596
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,160
we should organize the lectures on civilian education

597
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,200
as soon as possible.

598
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,640
Sir, where do you think

599
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
we should start first?

600
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,640
Don't we have a Red Building Reading Club at Peking University?

601
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
That's actually a youth evening school.

602
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,200
I think we can start an evening school for workers.

603
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,600
Let's start with the education of the workers

604
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,160
on campus,

605
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,040
then gradually spread it to the whole of society.

606
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,960
Good idea. We should start slowly.

607
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,560
In addition,

608
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,560
we can be led by several publications.

609
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,840
For example, "Citizen", "The Renaissance",

610
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,680
"Weekly Review", and "New Youth".

611
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,280
This will solve our faculty

612
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,320
and financial problems.

613
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
Well, let's discuss it tonight.

614
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,120
Alright.

615
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,960
Nothing is missing.

616
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,520
That works.

617
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,320
I'll speak now.

618
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,640
Right.

619
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,760
Ok.

620
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,360
Listen to me, everybody.

621
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,000
Today, I invited

622
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,760
Guo Xingang and Liu Haiwei

623
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,120
from Peking University.

624
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,520
Let's discuss the general rules of the work-study

625
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,800
mutual aid society.

626
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,120
There are three articles in the charter of the mutual aid society.

627
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,160
Let me read it to you.

628
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
First, each member per day

629
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
must work for four hours.

630
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,840
Second, necessary food, clothing and accommodation for members

631
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,600
will be provided by the society.

632
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,240
Education fees and book fees required by members

633
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,240
will be provided by the society.

634
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,440
Books must be owned by the society.

635
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,480
Third, the income from work will be collectively owned by the society.

636
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
Do you have anything to add?

637
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,640
In my opinion,

638
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,080
we should clearly declare

639
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,440
in the brief chapter

640
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,560
that the work-study mutual aid society

641
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
is a kind of communism without any constraints

642
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
based on the theory of mutual aid.

643
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
Guo, that's a good point.

644
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,520
I agree.

645
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,120
Wait a minute.

646
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Since mutual aid societies practice communism,

647
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,360
then I think

648
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,600
all members should explicitly

649
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,760
break away from family relations and marriage relations.

650
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,960
What do you think is the relationship between members?

651
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
Can everything be exchanged for what one needs?

652
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,880
No, Bai Lan, you misunderstood.

653
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,960
I mean, between members,

654
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,040
it should be a comradeship

655
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,200
It is a completely accommodating relationship

656
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,560
between thought and property.

657
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,400
This kind of comradeship

658
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,600
should not be affected by the family,

659
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
school, or marriage.

660
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,800
What do you mean by that?

661
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,520
Do you want to disassociate yourself from your family?

662
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
This is so unreasonable.

663
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,280
Is this necessary?

664
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,400
It is necessary.

665
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
Those who don't work, don't eat.

666
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
This is the most basic principle of communism.

667
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,040
We have to rely on our own hands,

668
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,240
to feed ourselves

669
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,280
and to create our world,

670
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,200
instead of relying on parents and families.

671
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,120
Chen Yannian, are you going to break off your relationship with your parents?

672
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,840
I'm not going to break up with my parents,

673
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,640
but I'll sever economic ties with family.

674
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,920
After joining the club,

675
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,520
don't let your family send you any more money.

676
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Can you do it?

677
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,720
I can do it.

678
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
I'll write a letter to my family in a couple of days.

679
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
Brother, are we

680
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,480
not going to go home for dinner either?

681
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
Let me talk about this question.

682
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,520
Not only can't we go home for dinner,

683
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,120
you can't eat at school either.

684
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,560
What you're eating doesn't count. You can keep eating.

685
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,120
We want to run our own canteen,

686
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,240
eat our own pots of rice and wear our own clothes.

687
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
Great!

688
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,640
What am I going to do for everyone?

689
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,840
My father is a chef at a famous Shandong restaurant.

690
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,760
He taught me his skills.

691
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,320
Braised sea cucumber with scallions. That's our specialty.

692
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
Give Liu Haiwei a round of applause.

693
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,520
Awesome!

694
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,560
Alright.

695
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,160
Then let's go down and get ready.

696
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,520
Let's go.

697
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,920
Lotus cake!

698
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,880
Lama cake!

699
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,880
Deep-fried dumplings with fried seeds!

700
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,320
I have read the report.

701
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,520
Civilian education itself is

702
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
an important part of the New Culture Movement.

703
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,120
Education has been popularized

704
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
to spread New Culture.

705
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:09,120
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

706
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,560
So the lecture group is good.

707
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Work-study mutual aid society is also good.

708
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,600
It is a practice site

709
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,080
and also a sign that we are going public.

710
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,280
I agree with all of them.

711
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,480
Excellent, Mr. Cai.

712
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
Actually, I discussed this matter with brother Zhongfu.

713
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,280
We are looking for someone to raise funds for the society.

714
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,800
Besides, the "Weekly Review"

715
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,440
and "New Youth"

716
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
will also open up projects

717
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
and guide these two activities at the same time.

718
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,480
I have a favor to ask here.

719
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:30,880
Mr. Cai.

720
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,200
Go on.

721
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
In order to raise funds for the society,

722
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
you have to take the lead.

723
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,640
It's my duty to take the lead.

724
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,440
Excellent.

725
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,040
In addition, I suggest that the public education lecture group

726
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,480
should start with Peking University.

727
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,640
Starting with the janitor of Peking University.

728
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,760
Let's start slowly,

729
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
then gradually expand to the whole of society.

730
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,000
Very well.

731
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,120
Come up with a plan.

732
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,600
What's so difficult in getting Zhongfu and Shizhi to help?

733
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,120
They will certainly support it.

734
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,680
Understood.

735
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,680
Auntie.

736
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,760
What's going on?

737
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,720
Yannian. Qiaonian.

738
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
Why did you come back so late?

739
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,200
What's going on here?

740
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,960
Nothing happened.

741
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
By the way, why did you come back so late?

742
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,400
Tell the truth.

743
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,640
How many times has this happened?

744
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,560
Not many times.

745
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Just once.

746
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,840
Just this time?

747
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
Last time, tabloids were delivered directly to home.

748
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,040
Don't mention that last time.

749
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,040
Does he know?

750
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,000
He still doesn't care, does he?

751
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,880
How does he manage?

752
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,440
Your father has so much

753
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,640
important things to do.

754
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,800
Yannian.

755
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,040
He's innocent as a lamb.

756
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,040
An upright person fears no gossip.

757
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
You must remember this sentence.

758
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,880
Alright.

759
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,960
Never mind. Come on.

760
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,760
Let's go home with auntie.

761
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,560
Come on.

762
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,960
Come on, it's fine.

763
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,520
It's OK, let's go.

764
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,960
Go.

765
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,080
Come into the house.

766
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,160
Zhongfu!

767
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,720
Let me help wash you.

768
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,920
Zhongfu!

769
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,680
Zhongfu!

770
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,440
Yannian and Qiaonian are back.

771
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,480
Big brother Qiaonian.

772
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,040
Why are you back so late?

773
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,120
Are you at home?

774
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,800
How rare.

775
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,560
Where do I go when I'm not at home?

776
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,320
I didn't wash you.

777
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Liu Mei didn't come back with you.

778
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,800
She is writing a letter to her family at school.

779
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,160
Homesick.

780
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,440
Not homesick.

781
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,360
She's writing a letter to sever ties with her family.

782
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,280
Sever ties?

783
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
What's the matter?

784
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,080
Nothing happened.

785
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,960
We're here

786
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,000
to cut our relationship with you.

787
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,360
Cut our relationship?

788
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
Dad, auntie.

789
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,840
Let me read our statement to you.

790
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,120
Chen Yannian and Chen Qiaonian have voluntarily organized

791
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
and joined the work-study mutual aid society,

792
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,640
to practice mutual aid theory

793
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
and implement communism.

794
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,440
From now on,

795
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,440
we hereby declare to disassociate

796
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
from all economic relations with family and all associated responsibilities

797
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,480
and obligations.

798
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,440
After a long time,

799
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,600
you have to break up with

800
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,360
your father, your auntie,

801
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,280
and your younger brothers and sisters just to start this mutual aid society.

802
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,800
What kind of support society is this?

803
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,880
This is called the Disowned People Club.

804
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,000
Auntie, you misunderstand.

805
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,400
We're not disassociating from blood relations.

806
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
We want to disassociate from economic ties.

807
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,080
Starting from today,

808
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
I and Qiaonian can't spend our family money

809
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,120
nor can we go home for dinner.

810
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,880
We have to support ourselves.

811
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
Because we are communists.

812
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,840
Communists?

813
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,520
Is this not child's play?

814
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,560
Zhongfu.

815
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,280
You.

816
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,800
Did you convince them to do this?

817
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
Take the children to bed.

818
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,280
Yannian. Qiaonian.

819
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,320
Come here.

820
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,720
Sit.

821
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,360
Let's go to bed.

822
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,320
Let's talk about this.

823
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,520
Go.

824
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
Go to sleep with your mother.

825
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,040
Mom, what's disassociation?

826
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,280
Children don't ask this.

827
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,080
Hurry up and go to sleep!

828
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,640
Go on.

829
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,640
The reason why I want to have a serious talk with you

830
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,520
is because what you are going to do now

831
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,200
is not a trivial matter.

832
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,760
You are not playing around.

833
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,280
You are doing an experiment.

834
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,800
But,

835
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,840
you should be prepared for failure.

836
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,040
I'm not prepared for that.

837
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,120
I won't fail.

838
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,080
Self-confidence is an advantage.

839
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,440
But you can't be blind and confident.

840
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm not blind.

841
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm using the most advanced theory as a guide.

842
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
There are many theories popular in Europe now.

843
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,440
What makes you say anarchism

844
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,400
is the most advanced theory?

845
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,840
I don't get it.

846
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,960
Didn't you also say

847
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
that anarchism is a good doctrine?

848
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,840
I think anarchism has a lot of good things.

849
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,520
But I advocate for more experiments

850
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,680
and to test it in those experiments.

851
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,360
I want to remind you.

852
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,040
These kinds of experiments

853
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,960
may make you pay a huge price

854
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,440
because it may not conform to our national conditions.

855
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,480
I have been following anarchism

856
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,000
for several years.

857
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,440
I trust my own judgment.

858
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,760
Anarchist mutual aid theory

859
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,280
is an advanced scientific theory

860
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,960
that can save China.

861
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
What theory is the most advanced?

862
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
What theory is most suitable for China?

863
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,760
This is to compare and experiment.

864
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
You can't jump to conclusions.

865
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,800
I support you because you are doing it.

866
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,920
But some people are empty talkers.

867
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,520
Don't listen blindly.

868
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,880
Who are you refering to?

869
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,680
People like Wu Zhihui.

870
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,960
If you say I do, you say I do.

871
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,480
Why do you involve others for nothing?

872
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,920
Why can't I talk about him?

873
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm going to talk about him today.

874
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,120
He sings high notes all day long,

875
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,280
dresses himself up as a virtuous saint,

876
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,800
deceives young people to be his followers.

877
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,320
Once you don't believe him,

878
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,160
this kind of people is said to turn the other cheek.

879
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,400
You can't get too close to him.

880
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,080
You have to be careful.

881
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
You've also had your fair share of fall-outs.

882
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,840
Should I also keep an eye on you?

883
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,120
By the way, you don't fall out

884
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,840
because you just wear a fake face.

885
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
You say you support it, but you don't agree with it.

886
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,960
It's not true

887
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,400
that your words and actions

888
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,840
have brought so much trouble to the family,

889
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,520
but it's also not true that you don't do anything about it.

890
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
What qualifications do you have for a person like you

891
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,680
to speak of others from a moral standpoint?

892
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,080
I am sharing my life experience with you.

893
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,680
Why are you so resistant?

894
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,360
I'm telling you something serious.

895
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,600
Why do you say these wretched words?

896
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,040
I'm also talking about something serious.

897
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,480
I didn't do anything stupid.

898
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,800
What are you doing?

899
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,840
I thought I told you to talk well.

900
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,400
Brother!

901
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,720
Yannian!

902
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,920
Dip in more sauce.

903
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,600
Ever since I came to Beijing,

904
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,720
I've never eaten this before.

905
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,000
Give me a hand.

906
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,800
Smells good.

907
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,760
Come on.

908
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,280
Try it.

909
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,840
Good, right?

910
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,880
So spicy!

911
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,280
Xingang, everyday you fill me up with these.

912
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,960
I don't know why you're doing this to me.

913
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,640
What do you mean, fill you up?

914
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
It's called pancake roll with green onions.

915
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,080
The more you eat, the stronger you'll be.

916
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,520
The stronger you'll be...

917
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,320
Yannian.

918
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
Why are you back?

919
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm really sorry.

920
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,680
I thought you weren't coming back tonight.

921
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,160
These are my fellow villagers from Qingdao.

922
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,640
It's late, so they'll stay here for the night.

923
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,840
That's fine.

924
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,240
What are they doing here?

925
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,840
To petition.

926
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,280
Petition the government to take back Qingdao occupied by Germany.

927
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
They also brought a people's statement.

928
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,920
That's a big deal.

929
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,920
You are here to live in peace.

930
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,600
I'll go find Zhao Shiyan.

931
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,880
Yannian.

932
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,480
Come here.

933
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,320
Come here.

934
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,920
Let me introduce you.

935
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,280
This is my cousin Guo Xinyi

936
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,200
and the leader of this petition group.

937
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,120
This is who I'm always telling you about,

938
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,880
Mr. Chen Duxiu's eldest son, Chen Yannian.

939
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,360
I'm counting on you, Student Chen.

940
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,640
Hello.

941
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,760
Yannian.

942
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,040
You have to help us with this.

943
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,160
They are all students.

944
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,960
They've just arrived

945
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,240
and they don't even know

946
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,960
where to send the petition.

947
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,480
No need to be polite to me.

948
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,760
I am duty-bound to do this.

949
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,640
Here, I'm going to bring Mao Zedong

950
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,920
and Zhao Shiyan over.

951
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,000
Let's discuss how to do this together.

952
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,680
Okay, okay, that's a good idea.

953
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,960
Then let's go now.

954
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,520
Let's go.

955
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,000
Let's go.

956
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,440
Bai Lan, please take care of them.

957
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,560
Leave it to me.

958
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,640
Come on.

959
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,320
Today, I'm going to ask you all

960
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,200
to make do here for a night.

961
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,120
Sir, these are my fellow villagers.

962
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,160
They just came to Beijing yesterday

963
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,440
and they don't know where to send the petition,

964
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,400
just coming to Peking University for help.

965
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,320
Last night we spent the night together.

966
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,640
I still have to trouble you, sir. Please do something.

967
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,320
Mr. Shouchang,

968
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,080
we are entrusted by the people of Shandong

969
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,080
to come to Beijing to submit a petition and a people's statement.

970
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,920
But this is our first time in Beijing,

971
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,680
we don't know what to do about it

972
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,480
and we would like to ask Mr. Shouchang to give us advice and guidance.

973
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,920
Advice is not guidance.

974
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,320
This petition of the Qingdao petition group

975
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,320
not only represents your Qingdao.

976
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
It also represents a common wish

977
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
of all us Chinese.

978
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,480
Peking University will rightly respond and support.

979
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,240
I'll tell you what, Xingang.

980
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,480
Go and find some classmates who write well.

981
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,720
Copy dozens of petitions

982
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,960
and post them in public at Peking University.

983
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,760
It's better than to print them leaflets.

984
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,880
Distributing them widely

985
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,920
can expand its reach.

986
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,640
Very well.

987
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,680
Liu Mei.

988
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,520
Later, you should go and find Professor Hu Shi.

989
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,120
Please do me a favor,

990
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,400
send the invitation letters to the embassies of Britain, America, France and Italy,

991
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,520
and translate them into English.

992
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,000
Understood.

993
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,160
As for the petition, the people's statement, the letters,

994
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,360
how do we send these?

995
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,080
Well then.

996
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
We will hold a school board meeting later.

997
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,080
I'll discuss it with you all

998
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,040
and gather the everyone's thoughts and strength.

999
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,720
I'm sure there will be a good way.

1000
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Do you think so?

1001
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,520
Thank you, Mr. Shouchang.

1002
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,680
Shizhi.

1003
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,000
Pen. Brush.

1004
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,080
The typewriters are all here.

1005
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,000
No matter which one you use,

1006
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,920
you have to write

1007
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,760
the articles of "Weekly Review", today.

1008
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,600
Today?

1009
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,120
Must I really?

1010
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,280
Isn't that too much to ask?

1011
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,240
I don't even use all these.

1012
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,600
What's wrong with asking others too much?

1013
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,800
Look at me with all this.

1014
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm so busy.

1015
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,120
I ask you.

1016
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,440
Are you a fellow editor of "New Youth"?

1017
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,320
I am.

1018
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,200
Isn't the "Weekly Review"

1019
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,880
the top priority of "New Youth"?

1020
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
What's wrong with asking others too much?

1021
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,680
You playing your scoundrel.

1022
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,520
I won't tell you. I'll check the information.

1023
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,160
It seems that today,

1024
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,080
you really carried this scoundrel through to the end.

1025
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,320
You know that I have always been afraid of people's words,

1026
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,840
then play a scoundrel.

1027
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,760
Isn't this bullying honest people?

1028
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
It is bullying honest people.

1029
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,080
I'm telling you, honest people like you don't bully.

1030
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,280
You will always be an honest person.

1031
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,960
What logic are you talking about?

1032
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,520
Hello, Mr. Shizhi.

1033
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,160
Hello.

1034
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,120
We've been spending this afternoon.

1035
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,920
Uncle Chen, why are you hiding behind the door?

1036
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,880
Never mind.

1037
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,480
Hello, uncle Chen.

1038
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,880
Mr. Shizhi, it's like this.

1039
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
These are invitation letters that we wrote

1040
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,760
to the four embassies of Britain, France, America and Italy for the return of Qingdao.

1041
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,920
Show me.

1042
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,200
It's quite good.

1043
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,800
Very touching.

1044
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,160
Brother Zhongfu, take a look.

1045
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,360
I don't need to look.

1046
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
They must be good.

1047
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,640
Because if these four letters

1048
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
have the support of these four countries.

1049
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
They must be of great benefit to recover Qingdao.

1050
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,000
Mr. Shizhi.

1051
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,920
Mr. Shouchang asked you to translate them into English,

1052
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,520
then the students of the petition group

1053
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,040
will send them to the embassies.

1054
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,400
They must be finished today.

1055
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,920
Today?

1056
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,200
They must?

1057
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,920
I have another thing waiting for me today.

1058
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,160
Liu Mei, how about this.

1059
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,520
Uncle Hu will also give you a task.

1060
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,400
My latest job.

1061
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,840
My tutor, Professor Dewey,

1062
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,440
is going to give lectures in China soon.

1063
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,880
I want to translate his speech

1064
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,240
and arrange his schedule.

1065
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,320
Arrange the place of his speech and visit.

1066
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,280
All right, all right.

1067
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,480
Shizhi, stop it.

1068
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,320
About Qingdao.

1069
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,920
What are these things to you?

1070
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,360
How about this. You can do this job first.

1071
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,200
This matter cannot be excused.

1072
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
Okay, I'll do Shouchang's thing.

1073
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,360
I won't do your request.

1074
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,280
What do you mean, I won't do anything?

1075
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,720
Do this, first.

1076
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
Let's do this job first.

1077
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Translate this during the day.

1078
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,040
In the evening,

1079
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,640
write the article in the "Weekly Review".

1080
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,640
I have to sleep at ten o'clock in the evening.

1081
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,680
Before ten o'clock,

1082
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,040
finish writing.

1083
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,240
At ten o'clock, go to bed.

1084
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,520
Perfect.

1085
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,840
You think of me as a donkey.

1086
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,520
Not a donkey.

1087
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,080
A camel.

1088
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,120
Okay.

1089
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,400
Liu Mei.

1090
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,600
Block the door.

1091
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,840
Don't let him go until he finishes translating

1092
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,520
Fine. I'll translate.

1093
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,200
You really do listen to him.

1094
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
Why is it taking so long?

1095
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,360
Wait a little longer.

1096
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,640
Students!

1097
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,880
Mr. Shouchang.

1098
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,320
Good news!

1099
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,360
Professors are very concerned about the return of Qingdao.

1100
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,480
They all say

1101
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,120
Peking University will give its full support

1102
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,960
to the petition activities of Qingdao petition group.

1103
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,400
Just now,

1104
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,800
Mr. Cai spoke to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee,

1105
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,240
Wang Daxie, by telephone.

1106
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
He hoped Wang Daxie can give support.

1107
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,160
Wang Daxie agreed.

1108
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,200
In his office this afternoon,

1109
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,960
he will meet with the delegates.

1110
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,440
This Wang Daxie

1111
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,640
was the acting prime minister of the government.

1112
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,960
The diplomatic institution he presides over

1113
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,360
is the highest diplomatic institution in China.

1114
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,040

1116
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,760
the Qingdao petition group will surely live up to its mission,

1117
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,760

1121
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,240

1129
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800

1130
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,320
