00:00:01,278 --> 00:00:04,316
[Episode Twenty]

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,760
Shizhi, don't forget.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,800
Behind us.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,640
There's also a Japan that's waiting for you.

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,240
Brother Zhongfu, what do you think.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,760
I agree with Shizhi.

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
I have studied a lot of Wilson's speeches.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
I think he is a gentleman. .

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,320
He made two suggestions.

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,360
Countries are not allowed to take power.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,200
To violate the equality and freedom of other countries. .

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,240
Governments are not allowed to take power. .

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
To violate the equality and freedom of the people. .

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,600
I thought about it.

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,960
As long as you do these two things .

17
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,120
Then justice must triumph over power.

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,320
So I'm going to .

19
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,520
In the next issue of Weekly Review.

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,480
Come and write an article.

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,080
Let's have a good talk.

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,600
The best person in the world.

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
Shouchang, can you also write a Paris Peace Conference?

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,120
But I'm not that interested in America.

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,320
You know what?

26
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Let me write an article about the October Revolution in Russia.

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,440
It is also inclusive.

28
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,120
史鸷你呢.

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Maybe next time.

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,720
I've been too busy recently.

31
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,160
Which one of us is the busiest?

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:00,960
You.

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,320
You must be.

34
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:02,800


35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,760
fault.

36
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,120
I think it's Shizhi.

37
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,040
Why?

38
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,360
Because he works hard every day.

39
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,440
You have to go to bed at ten o'clock in the evening.

40
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,600
The Homemaker.

41
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,800
Otherwise, don't let in. .

42
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,080
Are you two done?

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,360
Come on in.

44
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm really impressed with you.

45
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,120
十堰.

46
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,520
Can all these books be sold? .

47
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,440
Brother Ge said that they are in Changxindian.

48
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,160
There are thousands of people.

49
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,440
Maybe it's not enough to sell.

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
I also bought some.

51
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,000
New magazines and newspapers.

52
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,840
Sure enough, everyone is here now.

53
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,880
Pay attention to this Wilson.

54
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,160
Even Liang Qichao.

55
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,160
Also wrote an article "League of Nations and China".

56
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Wilson's League of Nations.

57
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
It is the best means to realize a harmonious world.

58
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,040
Didn't Mr. Shouchang write .

59
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,160
Two articles about Russia?

60
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,440
New Era and Victory of Bolshevism.

61
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,400
I bought that, too.

62
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
But it seems that now everyone.

63
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,200
Let's pay more attention to Wilson.

64
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Brother Zhao.

65
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,960
You see, now people are interested in violent revolution.

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
There is still conflict.

67
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,560
I said, what's wrong with your two brothers recently?

68
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,400
When it comes to violent revolution.

69
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
It's like seeing the god of plague.

70
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,080
Think about it. Since ancient times .

71
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,520
Which reactionary regime?

72
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
Is to withdraw from the stage of history.

73
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,920
Which violent revolution since ancient times?

74
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,880
There is no bleeding.

75
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:10,960


76
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,640
The reactionaries cannot be defeated.

77
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,080
This is common sense and law.

78
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,120
Russian October Revolution.

79
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
Is to defeat the reactionaries.

80
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,360
Established the people's political power.

81
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,960
Can ordinary people live a good life? .

82
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,880
How do you know the Russian people?

83
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,920
Have a good life now.

84
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,000
But I hear all countries are blocking them now. .

85
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,280
Domestic rebellion continues. .

86
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,320
Let me tell you.

87
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,240
Take a long-term view of the problem.

88
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
The replacement of old and new social systems.

89
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
It takes a long struggle.

90
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,800
There is no problem with your long-term vision.

91
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,760
All right, let's not argue.

92
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,240
Grandpa, give me a hard push.

93
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
Come on, come on.

94
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,000
fast.

95
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
Brother Ju Ren.

96
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
I was specially called here today, and I was specially given a painting.

97
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm afraid it's not in the bar.

98
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
clever.

99
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,080
Tang Bo Lu Zhengxiang is going to Paris soon.

100
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
This diplomatic stall.

101
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Chen Zhuan alone is the acting chief.

102
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
It won't hold up.

103
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
So at this juncture.

104
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
You can't think about hiding at leisure.

105
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
You foreign affairs Committee .

106
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,040
In my presidential palace.

107
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,880
The decision-making body of foreign affairs.

108
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How to talk in Paris is up to you. .

109
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
Brother Ju, fool the ghost.

110
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,440
A Cao Rulin.

111
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
Will be able to veto my proposal.

112
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
I think it's hard for me to do anything.

113
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
Can't be pessimistic.

114
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
It's hard to be treated as a victorious country.

115
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
You have to do something. .

116
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,880
This is a godsend opportunity.

117
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,720
Heaven is responsible for it.

118
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
Now there is a difficult problem to decide.

119
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,840
You said.

120
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,520
We went to Paris for peace talks with five people.

121
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,800
But they gave our negotiators.

122
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,160
Only two people.

123
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
Who is the permanent representative in charge of the talks?

124
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
This candidate is crucial.

125
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
Lu Zhengxiang is the chief representative.

126
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,640
There is one seat left.

127
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,040
Let them take turns to attend.

128
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
Absolutely not.

129
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
This Lu Zhengxiang is in poor health. .

130
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,880
Live in Switzerland for a long time.

131
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,880
Wang Zhengting knows nothing about diplomacy.

132
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,240
Can't be the master.

133
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
What do you mean?

134
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
My opinion is.

135
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,800
Let Gu Wei fish rank second.

136
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,640
Let him be the master.

137
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
There must be no trouble in the south.

138
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,640
So this thing.

139
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,640
You have to be the big president to make decisions. .

140
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
Tell them to take care of the overall situation.

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,640
good.

142
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,240
I will do as Chairman Wang said.

143
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,800
This picture is too good.

144
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,360
Yannian.

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,520
Come and help me classify these new books.

146
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,320
Be sure to check it out. .

147
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,640
line.

148
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,440
When I finish distributing the newspapers.

149
00:04:59,520 --> 00:04:59,600
okay.

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Qiaonian.

151
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,480
Come and share the newspaper with me when you are finished. .

152
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,880
good.

153
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,640
Yes, sir.

154
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,200
hello.

155
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,080
thank you.

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes, sir.

157
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,760
hello.

158
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Yes, sir.

159
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Prynne worked hard.

160
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes, sir.

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,480
Yes, sir.

162
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,600
Hello, everyone. Hello, Mr. Shouchang.

163
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,040
寿昌先生.

164
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,880
I haven't seen you for some time.

165
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,280
Estimate your time.

166
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
Are you the busiest person in Peking University?

167
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,760
How do you say this?

168
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,560
Look, you are the director of the library.

169
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,760
It's New Youth again.

170
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
And the editor of the Weekly Review.

171
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,200
Or the new magazine "National".

172
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,400
Editor in chief and writer.

173
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
Recently, you have.

174
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
Based on the Youth Reading Club.

175
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,800
And founded the Marquez Research Institute.

176
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,640
And you often.

177
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,040
Go to Changxindian factory for research and investigation.

178
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,200
Do you say there is anyone busier than you?

179
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
Not the Marquez Institute.

180
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,080
It's the Marx Society.

181
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,560
I remember it was the Marquez Institute.

182
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
It's Marquez.

183
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,240
Mr. Wang deliberately called it Marquez.

184
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
Not Marx.

185
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,880
Just to make people think that we .

186
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,280
It's a society that studies Malthusian demography.

187
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,040
So the authorities won't get into trouble.

188
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,200
Marx's research will cause trouble. .

189
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,280
I'm here with Mr. Dazhao this time. .

190
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
Read some books by Marx.

191
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,840
Or deeply inspired.

192
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,800
Nice!

193
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,000
It's time to start.

194
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
Read Marxist books consciously.

195
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,720
Students, our book club in the future.

196
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
It is important to recommend it.

197
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
Let everyone read more books on Marxism.

198
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,960
寿昌先生.

199
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,480
寿昌先生.

200
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,000
sir.

201
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,480
Runzhi and I want to ask you something.

202
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,000
You said.

203
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,520
Here's the thing, Mr Shouchang .

204
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
I just received a letter from Hunan.

205
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
I think this letter is particularly reasonable.

206
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
So I wanted to come and discuss a solution with you. .

207
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
Please have a look, sir.

208
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
My friend Xiong Guangchu.

209
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
Is a member of Xinmin Society.

210
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,160
He suggested in the letter.

211
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
It is first promoted by teachers and students of various colleges and universities.

212
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,160
In towns and villages across the country.

213
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,760
Generally set up reading rooms. .

214
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
Carry out a new culture to the people of the whole country. .

215
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
And the propaganda of advanced ideas.

216
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
Gradually improve the quality of the people.

217
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,720
sir.

218
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
I think Runzhi's suggestion is particularly good.

219
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,640
Now the enlightenment of new culture thought.

220
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,720
Mainly among students and young people.

221
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,360
If we can set up a reading room .

222
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,120
To gradually improve the quality of the people.

223
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
Publicize new ideology and culture.

224
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,960
This is a wonderful thing.

225
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,400
Although the suggestion is good .

226
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
But in all towns and villages across the country.

227
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,960
It's not easy to set up a reading room. .

228
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,680
Mr. Shouchang, this needs at least.

229
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
Someone should come out and take the lead first. .

230
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,280
This new culture is going to the public.

231
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
A good suggestion.

232
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,320
But this proposal.

233
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Will consume a lot of manpower and financial resources. .

234
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,120
The key, Runzhi, is as you said.

235
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,200
Who will hold this head?

236
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
Runzhi's suggestion is.

237
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
Our Peking University will take the lead.

238
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,520
Spreading the new culture is the responsibility of Peking University.

239
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,200
But this thing.

240
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
You should report it to Mr. Cai. .

241
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,400
Let him decide.

242
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
OK, I'll write to Mr. Cai now.

243
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,320
good.

244
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,000
sir.

245
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,960
classmates.

246
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,040
I've been thinking about a problem recently. .

247
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,320
Our book club.

248
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
You can't just stop at the ideological confrontation.

249
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
More importantly.

250
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,840
Combine truth with practice.

251
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,280
So I have an initiative.

252
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,680
Set up a work-study mutual aid society.

253
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,600
According to the theory of mutual aid.

254
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,680
Form a mutual aid group.

255
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,160
Try out mutual assistance communism.

256
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,760
I wonder if you agree.

257
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,160
Yannian your idea before.

258
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
Wang Guangqi mentioned it.

259
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,360
I think there is nothing wrong in theory.

260
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
But the actual operation.

261
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,400
Will it be difficult?

262
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
I discussed this problem with him.

263
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
He wants to make a big one.

264
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
But it's also difficult. .

265
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
I just want to do a small-scale experiment first.

266
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
It's in our book club and French study hall.

267
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,640
Try this range first.

268
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,400
Today, I just make an initiative first.

269
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
If everyone thinks it's feasible .

270
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,000
Then I'll go back to draft the articles of association immediately.

271
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
He advocates this.

272
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,440
You did a good job.

273
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
This is the case and this is the case. .

274
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,760
I think it's pretty good.

275
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,960
I'm willing to have a try.

276
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,280
right.

277
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
I think it's very good to prolong this initiative.

278
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,520
Combining truth with practice.

279
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,480
I have an initiative.

280
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,440
please.

281
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
I think the new culture should go to the public.

282
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
Must be combined with the masses of workers and peasants.

283
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,520
I did research in Changxindian a while ago.

284
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,720
Also gained a lot.

285
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,560
Xindian has nearly 4,000 workers.

286
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
Workers work long hours. .

287
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,280
Pay less.

288
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
Everyone works about ten o'clock every summer.

289
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,280
Work about 11: 00 or 12: 00 in winter.

290
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,400
But the wages only range from three cents to one yuan.

291
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
Many workers work all day.

292
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
Without food and clothing.

293
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,040
What surprises me even more is that.

294
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
The number of illiterate workers.

295
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,240
We took two hundred copies of New Youth.

296
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
Even the last half was not sold.

297
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
I really feel that we are interested in this group.

298
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,800
I really don't understand.

299
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,480
So I'm ready to organize with ZhongJie.

300
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,600
Civilian education lecture group.

301
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Make a series of speeches with Changxindian as a pilot.

302
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
And do an in-depth investigation.

303
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,120
Shiyan is absolutely right.

304
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
I think research and speeches.

305
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,280
Should be combined.

306
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,800
This form of speech.

307
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
It may be even more urgent for civilians.

308
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,840
Because there are few civilians who can read now. .

309
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,320
People who can read publications and printed matter.

310
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,040
Even less.

311
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,880
So if you want to carry out universal education.

312
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,960
You have to start with a speech.

313
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
And I think.

314
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
The organizational form of this lecture group on civilian education.

315
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,840
It doesn't have to be complicated.

316
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,200
You can work in groups of several people.

317
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
Draw up a topic in advance.

318
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,840
Go to a place where there are many people.

319
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,120
Such as temple fairs, to give speeches. .

320
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,000
right.

321
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,440
The topic doesn't have to be complicated.

322
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,360
Let's start with common sense of life and current news.

323
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,560
We're going to make.

324
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
Working and poor workers and civilians.

325
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,960
To get a glimpse of current events.

326
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,080
Learn some common sense.

327
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
Then you can realize your position.

328
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,280
And the source of social diseases.

329
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,360
Let them do some active activities.

330
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,120
That won't achieve our goal.

331
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
I've been in Changsha these years.

332
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,280
Soak among ordinary people every day.

333
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,320
Their suffering.

334
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,440
Their joy.

335
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
I feel the same way more or less.

336
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,560
And, ah.

337
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,880
I know better what they really want. .

338
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
So Shiyan still has a proposal to prolong life.

339
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
I couldn't agree more.

340
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,520
These two societies.

341
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,280
I want to participate.

342
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
I participate.

343
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,000
join.

344
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,520
Yannian.

345
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,720
You asked me just now.

346
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,160
What do you think of your proposal?

347
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
I want to applaud you and Shiyan.

348
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,960
classmates.

349
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,520
Why should I applaud these two students?

350
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Because these two students.

351
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
They all saw a problem.

352
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
That is, theory and practice should be combined.

353
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
It's like we're celebrating.

354
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,200
As stated at the European War Victory Conference.

355
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,800
New Culture Movement.

356
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
Now we have reached a turning point.

357
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,800
That turning point is the New Culture Movement. .

358
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,120
Go to the public.

359
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,720
Nakasuke.

360
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
There is an echo of the letter to Mr. Ercai.

361
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
What did Mr Cai say?

362
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,240
Mr Cai fully supports it.

363
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,920
And urge us all.

364
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,600
Go out as soon as possible.

365
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I have just listened to your classmates' speeches.

366
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,120
I am both excited and admired.

367
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,800
Excited is that.

368
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
I saw everyone's insights.

369
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,640
Admire that.

370
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,040
I saw everyone's pioneering spirit.

371
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
You choose to go out.

372
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
That means giving up a lot.

373
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,000
It means that you have chosen a difficult road.

374
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,400
And gave up a comfortable Shizhi road.

375
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,360
It means that you have chosen a pioneering road.

376
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,080
And gave up a road to success.

377
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,400
It means that you have chosen one.

378
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,880
The road to struggle against difficulties.

379
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,040
And gave up the comfortable road of sitting and talking. .

380
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,240
classmates.

381
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
We are going out of the study soon.

382
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,080
Go to the grass-roots level.

383
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,600
I know this road is hard and bitter.

384
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
But I firmly believe.

385
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
No matter how hard it is.

386
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,400
Can't beat you either.

387
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,040
Because I saw everyone's courage.

388
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,880
Boys and girls, I sincerely hope that everyone.

389
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,440
Be able to step on the dirt with both feet.

390
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
length by length.

391
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,120
Get down to .

392
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,880
Take every step of the way.

393
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
And I believe that victory will definitely belong to us. .

394
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,800
Because we're already on our way.

395
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
good.

396
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
good.

397
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,040
Let's solve a problem.

398
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
We must first know the essence of this problem.

399
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,840
Then this is the purpose of going to the grass-roots level.

400
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
It's just that trees are expensive today.

401
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,880
We made appointments with many workers' representatives.

402
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,320
Be sure to ask questions. .

403
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Only when there are problems will there be knowledge.

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Sir, Mr. Shouchang.

405
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,000
sir.

406
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,200
润之仲解.

407
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
寿昌先生.

408
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,400
来了润之.

409
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll ask Zhong Jie to call you here.

410
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,480
I want to invite you to participate in our activities in Peking University.

411
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm not bothering you, am I?

412
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,720
no.

413
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,480
How long has Runzhi been in Beijing?

414
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,920
It's been more than half a year.

415
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,120
Have you ever been to Changxindian?

416
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
I've been to Zhong Jie and Zhao Shiyan.

417
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,480
But it's all a cursory visit.

418
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
I know you are going to do special research this time.

419
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,240
Opportunities are (like angels' visits) few and far between.

420
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
I can also get a closer look. .

421
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,280
The state of workers.

422
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,400
Marx said.

423
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,840
Industrial working class.

424
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,840
Is the most advanced class in the world.

425
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
But this sentence.

426
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,920
Is it in line with China's reality?

427
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
I think it's a real problem.

428
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
We have been to Changxindian several times before.

429
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,400
I think Marx has a point.

430
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,800
Makes no sense.

431
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
Let us experience it with our own heart.

432
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,440
You are in charge of recording today.

433
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,400
good.

434
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:03,920


435
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,200
This is for the guests.

436
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,080
Go play.

437
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,560

439
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
This is the one I always tell you about.

440
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,840
Professor Li Dazhao of Peking University .

441
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,600

Sit inside, sit inside.

Have a chat with us.

457

Professor Li, these.

458
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,960
It's all the old workers on our railway.

459
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
Please feel free to ask if you have any questions. .

460
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,440
good.

461
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,440
Hello, masters.

462
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,400
good.

463
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,280
To this gentleman.

464
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,120
Actually, we're here.

465
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
Just want to talk to the masters.

466
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,360
Chat and talk.

467
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,200
Everyone knows that.

468
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
This world war is over.

469
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,440
China, on the other hand, has become a victorious country.

470
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,400
But we in China.

471
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
How did you become a victorious country?

472
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
That's because of China.

473
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,760
Sent more than a dozen workers.

474
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,440
Went to the European battlefield.

475
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,200
Because of these workers.

476
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,000
With one's own blood, sweat and life.

477
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
Come to our country.

478
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
Won the honor!

479
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
Personally, I also think.

480
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,840
Our Chinese workers.

481
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
Is the most hardworking person in the world.

482
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,480
The greatest worker.

483
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,960
Should be widely respected by the society.

484
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,920
Professor Li.

485
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,760
Ah, you're welcome.

486
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
If you have any questions, just ask.

487
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,440
We don't hide anything.

488
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,400
Okay, okay, okay.

489
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,960
I want to ask you a question first. .

490
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,680
What specific jobs are you engaged in?

491
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,200
Xindian locomotive and rolling stock factory.

492
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,360
It is an early modern industry in China.

493
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
It belonged to China's early industrial army. .

494
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,600
Important breeding ground.

495
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,760
After the October Revolution in Russia.

496
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,960
Chinese advanced elements are beginning to realize .

497
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,440
The great power of the working class.

498
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,840
March 1919.

499
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
Unde that guidance of Li Dazhao.

500
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,200
Organized and established in Peking University in Deng Zhongxia. .

501
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,200
Civilian education lecture group.

502
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,760
Start giving lectures at Changxindian.

503
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,040
In the process of integrating with the masses of workers .

504
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,120
Li Dazhao, Deng Zhongxia and others.

505
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,320
Preliminary contact.

506
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,840
Marxist intellectuals.

507
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,800
Thoughts and feelings are further transformed into.

508
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,160
On the working class side.

509
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
At the same time, some workers such as Ge Shugui.

510
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
Thanks to the education of Marxism-Leninism.

511
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
And improve class consciousness.

512
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,200
Become an advanced member of the working class.

513
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,600
Become an advanced member of the working class.

514
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:43,840


515
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
Shiyan, do you know anything about the countryside?

516
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
My family has been studying since childhood in the town.

517
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,120
I really don't know much about the countryside.

518
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
I think in our country.

519
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
Workers live like farmers.

520
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,880
Not much difference.

521
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,920
How can you see it that way?

522
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,160
I think if I want to understand China .

523
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,520
First of all, we must understand farmers. .

524
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,160
寿昌先生.

525
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
I have a question I want to ask you.

526
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,080
You said.

527
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,440
I always thought.

528
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,080
The image of industrial workers in our country is particularly tall.

529
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,280
But why?

530
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
Their life is so hard.

531
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
This is China's national condition.

532
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
And the differences between Japan and even Europe.

533
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
Although I have never been abroad, I know.

534
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
The industrialization level of our country.

535
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
There is no comparison with them.

536
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,240
Revolution in Europe.

537
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,560
Are held with the working class as the center.

538
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,000
Biru said Paris commune.

539
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
Russian October Revolution.

540
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,120
Are centered on the working class.

541
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,720
Held in the central city.

542
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,800
Working class in Europe.

543
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,280
Is the most conscious and disciplined.

544
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,800
The most united class. .

545
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,640
I think the workers in our country are not simple either. .

546
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
Although they are not highly educated.

547
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,400
I've had a hard time.

548
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,840
But they have no interest in our country.

549
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,640
Still very concerned.

550
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,200
Some of their words touched me very much today.

551
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,760
It's raining.

552
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,160
Let's go to the tea shop in front to take shelter from the rain. .

553
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,600
good.

554
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,040
The hill came to shelter from the rain.

555
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,760
a good man.

556
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,720
Hurry up, hurry up!

557
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,040
What a heavy rain!

558
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,240
Lao ban lai Hu cha .

559
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,640
Ah, guys.

560
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:14,960
Five people.

561
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,520
Okay, okay, okay.

562
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,720
Come in for shelter after the hill is busy.

563
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,600
a good man.

564
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,200
Come, sir, please.

565
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,520
Nakasuke.

566
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
Actually, I just felt the same way as you.

567
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
Ah, just workers in our country.

568
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,120
It's too little.

569
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
And what I didn't expect was that.

570
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
There are also many workers who came from bankrupt farmers.

571
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,760
Although their lifestyle has changed.

572
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,200
But the circumstances of this life.

573
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,240
Without any change.

574
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
Even some people are worse than before.

575
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,440
Ah, so their mode of thinking and way of thinking.

576
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
It's the same as before. It doesn't make much difference.

577
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,840
I think for a real revolution.

578
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
First of all, we should start with farmers.

579
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
Runzhi, that's a good question.

580
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
I think we should find a way out for China.

581
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
This problem should be studied. .

582
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,000
Jiewo Marquez Research Institute.

583
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,120
To study this problem.

584
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,760
Sir, there's one more thing that shocked me today. .

585
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
That is the number of illiterate workers in Changxindian.

586
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,720
It is beyond my imagination.

587
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,760
I remembered the letter from Xiong Guangchu.

588
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,680
His letter mentioned above .

589
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,880
It's too important to talk about civilian education.

590
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,080
So I think.

591
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,160
We should send the public education lecture group as soon as possible.

592
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,200
organize.

593
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,640
Sir, do you think.

594
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
Where should we start first?

595
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,640
Don't we have a red chamber reading club at Peking University?

596
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
That's actually a youth evening school.

597
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,200
I think we can start an evening school for workers.

598
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,600
Let's put the education of the workers on campus first.

599
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,160
Make it up first.

600
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,040
Then gradually spread to the whole society.

601
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,960
A good idea is easy before it is difficult.

602
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,560
in addition.

603
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,560
We can be led by several publications.

604
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,840
For example, "National" and "Trendy".

605
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,680
Weekly Review and New Youth.

606
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,280
This solves the problem of our teachers.

607
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,320
There is also the question of funding.

608
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
Well, let's discuss it tonight. .

609
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,120
good.

610
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,960
No less.

611
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,520
all right.

612
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,320
Then I said it.

613
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,640
right.

614
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,760
good.

615
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,360
Listen to me, everybody. .

616
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,000
Today, by putting Guo Xingang.

617
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,760
There are two people Liu Haiwei.

618
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,120
The opportunity to come from Peking University.

619
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,520
Let's read the general rules of mutual aid society.

620
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,800
Negotiate.

621
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,120
There are three articles in the general rules of the Mutual Aid Society.

622
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,160
Let me read it to you.

623
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
The first member is each person per day.

624
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Must work for four hours. .

625
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,840
2. Necessary food, clothing and accommodation for members.

626
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,600
Supplied by groups.

627
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,240
Education fees and books fees required by members .

628
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,240
Supplied by groups.

629
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,440
Books must be owned by groups.

630
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,480
Third, the income from work is owned by the group.

631
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
Do you have anything to add? .

632
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,640
I think.

633
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,080
We should be in the brief. .

634
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,440
Declare clearly.

635
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,560
Gongdu Mutual Aid Society.

636
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
It is implemented according to the theory of mutual aid. .

637
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
Communism without any constraints.

638
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
Lao Guo, that's a good point. .

639
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,520
I agree.

640
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,120
Wait a minute.

641
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Since mutual aid societies practice communism.

642
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,360
Then I think.

643
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,600
All members should explicitly.

644
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,760
Break away from family relations and marriage relations .

645
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,960
What do you think is the relationship between members?

646
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
Can everything be exchanged for what one needs? .

647
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,880
No, Prynne, you misunderstood.

648
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,960
I mean, between members.

649
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,040
It should be a gay relationship.

650
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,200
It's thought and property.

651
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,560
A completely accommodating relationship.

652
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,400
What about this gay relationship?

653
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,600
Should not be affected by family. .

654
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
Crane of school and marriage.

655
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,800
What do you mean by that?

656
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,520
Do you want to get out of touch with your family?

657
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
This is so unreasonable.

658
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,280
Is this necessary?

659
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,400
It is necessary.

660
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
No laborer can eat.

661
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
This is the most basic principle of communism.

662
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,040
We have to rely on our own hands.

663
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,240
Feed themselves.

664
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,280
Create the world.

665
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,200
Instead of relying on parents and families.

666
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,120
Are you going to break up with your parents in Chen Yannian? .

667
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,840
Not to break up with my parents.

668
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,640
But to sever economic ties with the family.

669
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,920
After joining the club.

670
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,520
Don't let your family send you any more money.

671
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Can you do it?

672
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,720
I can do it.

673
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
I'll write a letter to my family in a couple of days.

674
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
Brother, are we.

675
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,480
Can't go home for dinner either.

676
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
Let me talk about this question.

677
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,520
Not only can't we all go home for dinner.

678
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,120
You can't eat at school either.

679
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,560
This meal doesn't count. Keep eating.

680
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,120
We want to run our own canteen.

681
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,240
Eat a big pot of rice and wear big clothes.

682
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
Great.

683
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,640
What am I going to do for everyone?

684
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,840
My father is the cook of Shandong Shandong Shandong Restaurant.

685
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,760
But I got the true biography.

686
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,320
Braised sea cucumber with onion is our unique skill.

687
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
Give Liu Haiwei a high hand.

688
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,520
good.

689
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,560
good.

690
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,160
Then let's go down and get ready.

691
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,520
go.

692
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,920
Furong cake.

693
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,880
Cake Lama.

694
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,880
Deep-fried dumplings with fried seeds .

695
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,320
I have read the report.

696
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,520
Civilian education itself is .

697
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
An important part of the new culture movement.

698
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,120
Education has been popularized.

699
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
To spread the new culture.

700
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,560
So the lecture group is good.

701
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Work-study mutual aid society is also good.

702
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,600
It is a practice base.

703
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,080
It is also a sign that we are going to the people.

704
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,280
I totally agree.

705
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,480
Great, Mr. Cai.

706
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
Actually, I discussed this matter with brother Zhongfu.

707
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,280
We are looking for someone to raise funds from the society. .

708
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,800
Besides, the Weekly Review.

709
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,440
New Youth.

710
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
Also open up projects.

711
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
Guide these two activities at the same time.

712
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,480
I have an uninvited invitation here. .

713
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:30,880
Mr. Cai.

714
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,200
You said.

715
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
To raise funds from the society.

716
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
You have to take the lead.

717
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,640
It's my duty to take the lead.

718
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,440
Great.

719
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,040
In addition, I suggest that the public education lecture group .

720
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,480
We should start with Peking University.

721
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,640
Start with the janitor of Peking University.

722
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:44,960
Easy before difficult 1.

723
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,760
Easy before difficult.

724
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
Then gradually expand to the whole society.

725
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,000
good.

726
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,120
Come up with a plan.

727
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,600
What's the difficulty in getting ZhongfuShizhi to help?

728
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,120
They will certainly support it.

729
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,680
good.

730
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,680
aunt.

731
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,760
what's up.

732
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,720
Yannian qiaonian.

733
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
Why did you come back so late?

734
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,200
What's going on here?

735
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,960
Nothing happened.

736
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
By the way, why did you come back so late?

737
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,400
Tell the truth.

738
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:08,720
南卡罗来纳州.

739
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,640
How many times has this happened?

740
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,560
Not many times.

741
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Just once.

742
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,840
Just this time.

743
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
Last time, tabloids were delivered directly to home.

744
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,040
Don't mention that last time.

745
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,040
Does he know?

746
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,000
He still doesn't care, does he.

747
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,880
How does he manage?

748
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,440
Your father has so much.

749
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,640
Important things to do.

750
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,800
Yannian.

751
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,040
The wise man knows he knows nothing.

752
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,040
a person standing straight doesn't worry about his shadow slanting—an upright person fears no gossip.

753
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
You must remember this sentence.

754
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,880
done.

755
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,960
Nothing. Come on.

756
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,760
Go home with menstruation.

757
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,560
come.

758
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,960
It's okay to go.

759
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,520
It's okay.

760
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,960
go.

761
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,080
Come into the house.

762
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,160
中富.

763
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,720
Come and help wash it. .

764
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,920
中富.

765
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,680
中富.

766
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,440
Yannian and Qiao Nian are back.

767
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,480
Brother Qiao Nian.

768
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,040
Why are you back so late? .

769
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,120
Are you at home?

770
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,800
Ah, rare.

771
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,560
Where am I going when I'm not at home? .

772
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,320
Didn't clean you.

773
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Liumei didn't come back with you. .

774
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,800
She is writing a letter to her family at school.

775
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,160
Homesick.

776
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,440
Not homesick.

777
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,360
I'm writing a letter to sever ties with my family.

778
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,280
disengage.

779
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
What's the matter?

780
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,080
Nothing happened.

781
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,960
Let's come this time.

782
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,000
Is also out of relationship with you.

783
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,360
Get out of touch with us.

784
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
Dad, menstruation.

785
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,840
Let me read our statement with you.

786
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,120
Chen Yannian Voluntary Organization.

787
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
And join the work-study mutual aid society.

788
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,640
Practice mutual aid theory.

789
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
Implement communism.

790
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,440
From now on .

791
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,440
Break away from all economic relations with the family.

792
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
And the associated responsibilities and obligations.

793
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,480
Hereby declare.

794
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,440
Get along while.

795
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,600
Just to start this support group?

796
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,360
Just like my father menstruation.

797
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,280
And my younger brothers and sisters have broken up. .

798
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,800
What kind of support society is this? .

799
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,880
It's called "No Six Parents Club", okay?

800
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,000
Menstruation, you misunderstood.

801
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,400
We're not breaking away from blood relations. .

802
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
We want to get rid of economic ties.

803
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,080
start from today.

804
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Joe and I can't spend our family money.

805
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,120
Can't go home for dinner. .

806
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,880
We have to support ourselves.

807
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
Because we are communist.

808
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,840
communist.

809
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,520
Isn't this a child playing house?

810
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,560
中富.

811
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,280
you.

812
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,800
Did you wipe them?

813
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
Take the children to bed. .

814
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,280
Yannian qiaonian.

815
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,320
Come here.

816
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,720
sit.

817
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,360
Let's go to bed.

818
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,320
let's talk about.

819
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,520
go.

820
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
Go to sleep with your mother.

821
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,040
What is divorce, mom? .

822
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,280
Children don't ask this.

823
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,080
Hurry up and go to sleep!

824
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,640
come.

825
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,640
The reason why I want to have a serious talk with you.

826
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,520
Because you are now.

827
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,200
What is important is not trivial. .

828
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,760
You are not on a whim.

829
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,280
You are doing an experiment.

830
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,800
but.

831
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,840
You should be prepared for failure.

832
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,040
I wasn't prepared for that.

833
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,120
I won't fail.

834
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,080
Self-confidence is an advantage.

835
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,440
But you can't be blind and confident.

836
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm not blind.

837
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm using the most advanced theory as a guide. .

838
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
There are many theories popular in Europe now.

839
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,440
What makes you say anarchism?

840
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,400
Is the advanced theory.

841
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,840
I don't get it.

842
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,960
Didn't you also say.

843
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
Is anarchism a good doctrine?

844
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,840
I think anarchism has good things.

845
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,520
But advocate more experiments.

846
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,680
To test it in the experiment.

847
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,360
I want to remind you.

848
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,040
This kind of experiment.

849
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,960
You may pay a huge price.

850
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,440
Because it may not conform to our national conditions.

851
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm against anarchism.

852
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,000
I've been tracking it for years. .

853
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,440
I trust my own judgment.

854
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,760
Anarchist mutual aid theory.

855
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,280
Can save China.

856
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,960
Advanced scientific theory.

857
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
What theory is the most advanced? .

858
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
What theory is most suitable for China?

859
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,760
This is to compare and experiment.

860
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
Can't jump to conclusions.

861
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,800
I support you because you are doing it.

862
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,920
But some people are empty talkers.

863
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,520
Don't listen blindly.

864
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,880
Who are you?

865
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,680
Like Wu Zhihui.

866
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,960
You say me, you say me. .

867
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,480
What are you doing with someone else for no reason? .

868
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,920
Why can't I say him?

869
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm going to talk about him today.

870
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,120
He sings high all day.

871
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,280
Dress yourself up as a virtuous saint.

872
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,800
Deceive young people to be his followers.

873
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,320
Once you don't believe him .

874
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,160
This kind of person turns his face when he says he turns his face. .

875
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,400
You can't get too close to him.

876
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,080
You have to be careful.

877
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
You didn't fall out.

878
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,840
Should I also keep an eye on you?

879
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,120
By the way, you are not turned against.

880
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,840
Because you just wore a fake face.

881
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
You support it in your mouth, but you don't agree with it in your heart.

882
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,960
A duplicity is a falsehood.

883
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,400
Because of your personal words and deeds.

884
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,840
Bring so much trouble to the family.

885
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,520
But as if nothing had happened, it was also false.

886
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
What qualifications do you have for a man like you? .

887
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,680
Speak of others on a moral level. .

888
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,080
I am sharing my life experience with you.

889
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,680
Why are you so resistant? .

890
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,360
I'm telling you something serious.

891
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,600
Why do you say these asshole words?

892
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,040
I'm also talking about something serious. .

893
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,480
I didn't do anything stupid.

894
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,800
What are you doing?

895
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,840
I thought I told you to talk well.

896
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,400
brother.

897
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,720
Yannian.

898
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,920
More sauce.

899
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,600
Since I came to Beijing.

900
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,720
I've never eaten this before.

901
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,000
Give me a hand.

902
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,800
a slap in the face .

903
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,760
come.

904
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,280
Try.

905
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,840
No.

906
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,880
Hot.

907
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,280
My heart just returned these to me every day.

908
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,960
What is Ann's heart?

909
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,640
What do you mean, return it to you?

910
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
It's called pancake roll with green onions.

911
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,080
The more you eat, the stronger you are.

912
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,520
The more energetic.

913
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,320
Yannian.

914
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
Why are you back?

915
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm really sorry.

916
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,680
I thought you weren't coming back tonight. .

917
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,160
These are my fellow villagers in Qingdao. .

918
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,640
It's too late today, so stay here for the night. .

919
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,840
it doesn't matter.

920
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,240
What are they doing here?

921
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,840
To petition.

922
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,280
Ask the government to take back Qingdao occupied by Germany. .

923
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
This also brought a discount for all people.

924
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,920
That's a big deal.

925
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,920
You live here in a down-to-earth manner.

926
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,600
I went to Zhao Shiyan to pour my leg.

927
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,880
Yannian.

928
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,480

948
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,680
Okay, okay, that's a good idea.

949
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,960

Just came to Peking University for help.

961
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,320

Please ask Mr. Shouchang to give advice and guidance.

969
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,920
Dialing is far from guidance.

970

Widely distributed.

981
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,920

How to send it up? .

991
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,080
Coincidence.

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,000
No matter which one you use.

1002
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,920
Articles in the Weekly Review.

1003

Must also.

1006
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,280
Isn't that forcing?

1007
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,240
I don't even use it.

1008
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,600
What's wrong with forcing others?

1009
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,800
Look at me so much.

1010
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm so busy.

1011
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,120
I ask you.

1012
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,440
Are you a fellow editor of New Youth?

1013

I am.

1014
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,200
What about the Weekly Review.

1015
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,880
Is not the top priority of New Youth.

1016
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
What's wrong with forcing others?

1017
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,680
You want your scoundrel.

1018
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,520

You know I'm always afraid of people.

1022
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,840
You're a rogue.

1023
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,760
Isn't this bullying honest people?

1024
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
Is to bully honest people.

1025
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,080
I'm telling you, honest people like you don't bully.

1026
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,280
You will always be an honest man.

1027
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,960
What logic are you talking about?

1028

Very touching.

1040

Brother Zhongfu, take a look.

1041
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,360
I don't need to look.

1042
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
It must be good.

1043
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,640
Because if these four letters.

1044
