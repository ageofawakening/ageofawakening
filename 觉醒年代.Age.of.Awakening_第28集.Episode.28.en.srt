00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,600
Please be quiet.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,440
Quiet please.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,360

[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jiemin, President of Peking University]

Mr. Cai, and fellow classmates.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,080
This demonstration on the streets today

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,560
was the collective decision of all of us.

10

[Li Dazhao, styled Shouchang, Director of Peking University Library]

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,840
We cannot

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,920
leave the arrested 32 classmates

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,800
to face the consequences.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,840
I propose

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
all the students in Peking University

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,880
must unite.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
We go turn ourselves in to the Nine Gates Infantry Commander together.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,080
We go to jail together.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,520
We pledge to defend our arrested classmates to the death together.

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,160
We live and die with the arrested students!

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,480
We live and die with the arrested students!

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,120
We live and die with the arrested students!

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,360
Everyone, quiet please.

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,600
Let's listen to what Mr. Cai has to say.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,120
I want to tell you.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
The more intense the situation we are facing with,

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
the more we need to calm down.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,000
We are all scholars.

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,840
We are sensible.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,760
We are rational.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,360
We will never be like reckless bulls.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,160
We will not do what mobs do.

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,320
I, Cai Yuanpei, fully support

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,160
students' patriotic actions.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
But what happened

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,320
is not what I expected.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,800
I feel rather devastated now.

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,600
Heartbroken.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
I am the principal, I should take the fall for this.

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,120
I should take the blame and resign.

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,800
But the most urgent thing now

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
is to do everything possible

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,480
to rescue the arrested 32 students.

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,440
I want them out safely.

45
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,080
I just got word that

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,760
The arrested students

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
has been transferred to the metropolitan police department.

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
I am yet not sure it's a good thing or not.

49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,120
But I have made up my mind.

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
I am to go to the Metropolitan Police Department in person

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,520
and meet Police Chief Wu Bingxiang.

52
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
I am to ask him to release the students.

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,320
I'm going to take them back,

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
back to school safely.

55
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
So here, I ask my fellow students to be patient.

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,600
Do not go out.

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
I will update with you all.

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Can everyone do that?

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
Yes.

60

Students.

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
What Mr. Cai said just now,

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
did everyone listen?

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
We all want to be

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
a patriotic Chinese.

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
But patriotism requires

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
us to be even more calm.

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,560
Calm down.

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,120
Okay?

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,200
Okay.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
This meeting decided that

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
Peking University is to be locked down.

72
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Replace the principal of Peking University.

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
The arrested students are to be punished severely.

74

Wu Bingxiang, director of the Metropolitan Police Department

75
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,240

Brother Xicheng, I resign.

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,680
I can't carry on

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
doing this job anymore.

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
Yuanshu, this is not like you.

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
You don't quit when a national disaster coming close.

89
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,600
Stay?

90
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,360
What good can I do staying?

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,320
The student demonstration was driven by their patriotism.

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
Any sensible person can see it.

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,760
You arrested so many students.

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,960
You also want to lock down Peking University and replace Cai Heqing.

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
This will not only discourage students.

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Instead, it will add fuel to the fire.

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,120
It is bound to lead to greater chaos.

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
I am not drowning with you.

99
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,480
Yuanshu, come.

100
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Come on.

101
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
You really don't understand my mind?

102
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
I have the same opinion as yours.

103
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,520
But can you go against Duan Qirui's will?

104
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
Students burnt down Zhaojialou

105
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,360
and wounded Zhang Zongxiang.

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,320
Xu Shuzheng threatened to set up a cannon at Jingshan.

107
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
He wants to erase Peking University once for all.

108
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
Under these circumstances,

109
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
some actions are necessary

110
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,240
so that everyone will agree to take a step back.

111
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,360
You want to replace Cai Yuanpei.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,920
Who will be that replacement?

113
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,920
Duan Qirui nominated Ma Qichang.

114
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,920
I beat about the bush.

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,040
Let's make a gesture first.

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
Wait for things to calm down.

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
With Peking University now,

118
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,520
I think no one except Cai Yuanpei

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,960
can have it under control.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
The real question here is

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,160
the police arrested dozens of students.

122
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,160
That's the tricky part.

123
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,120
If they don't let the students go or something goes wrong,

124
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,360
it will be a big deal.

125
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
We can't afford that happening.

126
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
Student affairs is very difficult.

127
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,040
The Anfu Club unanimously demanded severe punishment.

128
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
Only Wu Bingxiang is smart on this incident.

129
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
He intends to make use of these students,

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
so that he can have Cai Yuanpei under his thumb

131
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,120
and break down the student union.

132
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,320
He asked for my full cooperation too.

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
But Wu Bingxiang

134
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,360
is Duan Qirui's loyal clique.

135
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,200
Can you really trust him?

136
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
It is his duty after all.

137
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
To maintain public order in the capital,

138
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
you can't offend the students.

139
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
If this matter gets out of hand,

140
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
he is the first to be held accountable.

141
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
I say

142
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,440
the situation is hanging by a thread.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,760
It's like walking a tightrope.

144
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,520
We just do what we can.

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,920

Unless there is an order from the president, we can't do anything.

189
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
I understand, Chief Wu.

190
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,600
I will go visit the President.

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,560
And I will not ask too much of you two.

192
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Only for tonight,

193
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,040
I would like to ask you two to do me a favor.

194
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,240
Let me take my students back tonight.

195
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
I will for sure go visit President Xu tomorrow.

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
I will resign

197
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
if that's what it costs.

198
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,400
You are making a laugh, the President of Peking University.

199
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
Are you now treating the law and regulations as a joke?

200
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,480
What a joke.

201
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,840
These students of yours,

202
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
now they are prisoners of the state.

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,840
Sir,

204
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
I am Cai Yuanpei, a teacher.

205
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
Now my students are in trouble.

206
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,640
It is my obligation to save them.

207
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,400
It is my obligation to care.

208
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,120
So I'd like to sincerely ask two of you,

209
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,760
do me a favor please.

210
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,280
Don't you two have kids?

211
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
Don't your children go to school to study?

212
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,600
General Li said that the students commited crime.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
I would like to ask

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
did students act for themselves?

215
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
They did it for they have patriotic hearts.

216
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,280
They did it

217
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,960
for fighting the unfair Paris Peace Treaty.

218
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
This unfair Paris peace treaty

219
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,960
aroused the anger of every Chinese.

220
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,800
You two

221
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,840
are public officials of the government of the Republic of China.

222
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,200
In your eyes,

223
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
somehow patriotic students equals to prisoners.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,160
Jieping, what Principal Cai just said-

225
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,920
Right or wrong is none of my business.

226
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
Cai Yuanpei.

227
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,360
They say you are untouchable.

228
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

229
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Let you know what the rules are.

230
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
Get him out of here.

231
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,120
His students are nothing but trouble makers

232
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,240
act against the rule.

233
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
I will arrest and kill them if needed!

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,280
Take him away, go take a rest.

235
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,320
I am touching you today!

236
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,640
Principal Cai, you saw it.

237
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,840
Only if

238
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,400
there are orders from President Xu.

239
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,120
Otherwise,

240
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
there's really nothing we can do.

241
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,920
Let's take it slow.

242
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,560
Chief Wu.

243
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:50,960
Take it slow.

244
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,840
What is he doing...

245
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,960
Chief Wu!

246
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
China is the Chinese people's China.

247
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
You are also Chinese.

248
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
We marched in the streets for China.

249
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,400
What's wrong with that?

250
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
We are trying to make the government

251
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,040
refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

252
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,320
If Shandong is gone,

253
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
will China still be there?

254
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,080
That's right!

255
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Independence or death!

256
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,840
Independence or death!

257
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,240
Independence or death!

258
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
Independence or death!

259
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,400
Be quiet. This is a prison.

260
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
No matter who you are out there.

261
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,720
In here,

262
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,080
you have to follow the rules.

263
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,360
Prisoners are not allowed to talk and play with each other.

264
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,200
When sleeping,

265
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,560
everyone must either look up or turn around

266
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,080
every half hour.

267
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
To prove that the prisoner is still alive.

268
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
Prisoners can pee in the urinal.

269
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,960
For the other one they must hold it in.

270
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
This is a violation of our human rights.

271
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,760
You have to follow the rules here.

272
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,680
You can wait until tomorrow noon

273
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,560
to defecate!

274
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,000
You are violating our human rights.

275
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,880
I protest!

276
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
Yes, we protest!

277
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,240
Protest! Protest! Protest!

278
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
Protest as you like.

279
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,840
But the rules must be enforced.

280
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
Eat or not, I don't care.

281
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
You have to obey here.

282
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,640
Do you still have humanity?

283
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Isn't this bullying?

284
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,080
They burnt down Zhaojialou

285
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,720
without authorization.

286
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,760
They disrupted the plan!

287
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,360
Yes, it's their personal behavior.

Fu Sinian.

289
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
I think you must take full responsibility

290
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,280
for what happened today.

291
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
How can I take full responsibility for this?

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
I didn't agree to go to Zhaojialou.

293
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,040
So what?

294
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
No one listens to me as the commander in chief.

295
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
Since no one listens to you as the commander in chief.

296
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,400
Then I suggest

297
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
we revoke your assignment as the commander-in-chief!

298
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,840
I agree, I agree, I agree!

299

Very well.

I resign as commander-in-chief!

301
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,880
Fine by me.

302
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
Let's re-elect now.

303
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
Don't go. It's not your fault.

304
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,800
Don't say anything.

305
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,880
Fellow students, I propose,

306
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,320
in order to strengthen

307

308

five, contact National Education Association Chamber of Commerce and National Business Association

373
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,680
to call for co-action.

374
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,800
Do you have any objection?

375
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,680
No!

376
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
If there is no objection, please act immediately.

377
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,440
Let's go, let's go!

378
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,400
Go! Go!

379
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Shouchang, when did we know each other?

380
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,800
In Japan in 1915, right?

381
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
Because of your "Patriotism and Self-awareness",

382
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,720
you were besieged.

383
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
We had a long talk.

384
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,120
Yeah, it's for that self-awareness,

385
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,520
I went back to China to establish "New Youth".

386
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,840
Because I saw your "New Youth",

387
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
I realized I understood you wrong before.

388
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,840
So I joined you.

389
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
"New Youth" has been running for almost four years.

390
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,840
I can feel

391
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,520
it has reached a real turning point today.

392
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
I have a hunch that today

393
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
it will be a big day in Chinese history.

394
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:55,912
[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, Professor at Peking University]

395
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,440
Yes. From today,

396
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
we should not only disseminate

397
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,080
but also take practical actions.

398
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,800
Shouchang, I have a question for you.

399
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,160
Go ahead.

400
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,560
When I started "New Youth",

401
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,560
I put forward a goal.

402
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,440
To find a truth for China.

403
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,040
A path.

404
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,320
I want to ask you.

405
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,800
Do you feel that you have found it now?

406
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,280
I think I've found it.

407
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
That truth is Marxism.

408
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,440
The path is the Russian October Revolution.

409
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,720
Are you sure?

410
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
In the process of being sure.

411
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,080
Brother Zhongfu.

412
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,200
I recently wrote the article

413
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,400
"My View of Marxism".

414
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
I want to publish it in "New Youth".

415
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,280
Are you okay with that?

416
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,760
Of course, I started to pay close attention to Marx's works

417
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
from the second half of last year.

418
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,240
In the first six months of this year,

419
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,720
every issue of "New Youth" published and introduced

420
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,840
Marxist articles.

421
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,840
Especially last month's "Weekly Review"

422
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,520
which published Marx's

423
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,800
Chapter II of the "Communist Manifesto".

424
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,320
It had a great response.

425
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,120
My mind was delightened too.

426
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,400
The "Communist Manifesto"

427
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,640
is a classic work of Marx and Engels.

428
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
Very wonderful and profound.

429
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
I can recite many paragraphs.

430
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,040
To be honest,

431
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,040
although I'm not as sure as you are,

432
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,000
my interest in Marxism

433
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,840
is getting stronger and stronger.

434
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,600
As for the October Revolution in Russia,

435
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,120
I feel the same way.

436
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,280
I haven't done much research.

437
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,880
But I think

438
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,480
compared to Britain, France, and America,

439
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,680
the Russian way might be more suitable for China.

440
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,480
Shouchang, I really want to have a chance to have time

441
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
for the two of us to carefully and deeply

442
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,800
discuss this problem.

443
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,480
I also have a lot of ideas and questions

444
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
to discuss with you.

445
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,280
All the things happened today

446
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,800
stimulated me a lot.

447
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,240
I'm thinking,

448
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,080
maybe from today,

449
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,040
we're going to take on a path together

450
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
on the road of direct confrontation with the reactionary government.

451
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,320
Shouchang,

452
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,840
how should we follow this path?

453
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,360
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a long time.

454
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,160
I think what you said is right.

455
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,680
We have to let the people

456
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,960
come out and solve the problem directly.

457
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
Students alone can't do it.

458
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
We must mobilize the masses to fight.

459
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,920
Yeah, today was just a trigger.

460
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,000
Our mission

461
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
is to use it to detonate the whole of China.

462
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,800
Let all walks of life in the country take action.

463
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,160
Get them directly involved

464
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,000
and participating in the fight to transform the whole society.

465
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,800
Only then, China will have hope.

466
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
In the past, our "New Youth"

467
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
was only focused on ideological enlightenment.

468
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
Now we have to make it clear that

469
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
that task is the fundamental transformation of society.

470
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,720
That is our responsibility.

471
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,560
Good.

472
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,160
The "Weekly Review"

473
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,880
and "New Youth".

474
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,600
These two publications

475
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
will put out more articles regarding this.

476
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,040
We will start tonight.

477
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,040
Try to complete them by tomorrow.

478
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
Brother Zhongfu,

479
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,200
you remind me of that sentence again.

480
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
Let the tempest come strike harder!

481
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,400
Let's go.

482
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,920
In order to maintain order and rectify the current trend among education institutes,

483
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,840
all schools are ordered to strictly investigate

484
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,680
the Zhaojialou fire incident on May 4th.

485
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,840
Students who took the lead in that

486
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,440
shall be expelled.

487
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,720
No place for mercy and negotiation.

488
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,880
All schools shall behave accordingly

489
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,680
to this order.

490
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,228
What does this mean?

491
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:32,480
What do you mean?

492
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,280
No need to bother.

493
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,800
We quit!

494
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
No more class!

495
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,600
Strike, strike, strike!

496
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,840
Gentlemen.

497
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,600
Having you all gather here in our metropolitan police department

498
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,280
is really a great honor.

499
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,360
Please come inside, please.

500
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,320
What business do you have today, if I may ask?

501
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
Your honor, Chief Wu,

502
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
we are principals of major schools in Beijing.

503
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,240
We're all here for bail today.

504
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,840
We came for the thirty-two students who were arrested.

505
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
Chief Wu, please grant permission.

506
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,600
Principal Cai, soon you won't be the principal anymore.

507
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Why bother with those students?

508
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,160
Principal or not,

509
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,920
it doesn't really matter.

510
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,040
These students

511
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,280
will always be my students.

512
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,680
Besides, the behavior of students marching in the streets

513
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
is not unreasonable.

514
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,640
They were not looking for trouble.

515
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
They did it because of the unfair Paris Peace Treaty.

516
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
They marched for justice.

517
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
We support their actions.

518
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,160
If you want someone to be held accountable for that,

519
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
then pursue us.

520
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,480
Chief Wu,

521
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
unless you release the arrested students,

522
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,320
all principals will resign.

523
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes, we'll all resign.

524
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,880
Yes.

525
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,920
Principal Chen,

526
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,480
it's none of my business whether you resign or not.

527
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,600
It is not within my power

528
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
to release the students.

529
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,760
I can't give the order.

530
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,360
About that,

531
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,240
last night,

532
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,480
I made it clear to Principal Cai.

533
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
Please, you respected scholars here

534
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,240
don't make it difficult for me.

535
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Chief Wu,

536
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,400
now all schools in Beijing will go on a general strike.

537
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,040
It is these arrested students who are the cause.

538
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,320
If things gets out of hand,

539
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,600
the consequences are unimaginable.

540
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
Especially for you.

541
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,960
To shoulder the general responsibility of societal security in the capital.

542
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
You should think twice.

543
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,760
I thank you for reminding me.

544
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,600
As you all fully aware,

545
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,880
you are all guests of the high-ranking politicians.

546
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,560
Let me remind you, too.

547
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,440
Please.

548
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
As long as you can talk through President Xu,

549
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
and get a warrant

550
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,600
I will release them immediately.

551
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,920
Can you please bend the rules this time?

552
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,520
How about this.

553
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,240
You let us talk to the students.

554
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,960
Right.

555
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,080
You release them.

556
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,120
We will talk some sense into them.

557
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

558
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
This is the police department.

559
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,920
It's not a food market.

560
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
How can you bargain?

561
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
I understand your feelings.

562
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
But you are in the wrong place.

563
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,960
The wrong temple.

564
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,640
I advise you to find Xu Shichang.

565
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,160
I'm busy with my duty.

566
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,080
Please go back, please go back.

567
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
If you insist on staying,

568
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,160
have some tea in the side room then.

569
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,120
Make tea, make tea.

570
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,400
Gentlemen, please.

571
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,120
Wait a moment.

572
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Brother Jingtan, please stay.

573
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
My fellow townsman is here to give me the honor.

574
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,280
Should've have welcomed you.

575
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me.

576
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,640
We might be from the same town,

577
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,680
but we're on different paths.

578
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,200
I dare not flatter myself.

579
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Chairman Wang is here.

580
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,320
Any instructions?

581
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,920
Let's talk inside.

582
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,720
No, stay right here.

583
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,680
I'm here to submit a bail submission.

584
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,280
Who wants to pay the bail?

585
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,080
I, Wang Chonghui, and Lin Changmin

586
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,800
wish to bail the 32 arrested students arrested.

587
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,546
[Wang Daxie, styled Botang, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Republic of China]

588
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,520
This is the bail petition.

589
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
Let me read it to you.

590
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
No, I'll read it for myself.

591
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Wu Bingxiang,

592
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
are you going to listen or not?

593
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,840
I will listen.

594
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,480
I'm listening.

595
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm all ears.

596
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,160
On the fourth day of this month,

597
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,520
students from various schools in Beijing

598
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,440
called for diplomatic issues.

599
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The gathering of people led to the brewing incident

600
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,160
in the noisy fields at the time.

601
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,400
More than 30 students were arrested.

602
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,880
It is sad to see people brought the actions into excesses for a good cause.

603
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,000
For their patriotism.

604
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,160
And the more than 30 people,

605
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
who may not be the perpetrators,

606
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,040
Daxie, along with others, beg to bail them.

607
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,560
If you need these ones for interrogation in the future.

608
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
We bear the responsibility to deliver them to the court.

609
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
People's anger is getting closer to the limit any minute now.

610
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,520
For this reason, it is urgent for this bail to be granted.

611
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,600
With respect on behalf of the people.

612
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
Thus is presented to the police chief.

613
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,520
Presenters:

614
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,480
Wang Daxie,

615
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,600
Wang Chonghui,

616
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,120
Lin Changmin.

617
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,640
Chairman Wang,

618
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,600
I'll take your bail submission.

619
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
However,

620
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
for the release of students,

621
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,280
there must also be the approval of President Xu.

622
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,440
I hope you can understand my situation.

623
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,760

624
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,040
Beijing academic groups calling the Chinese delegation in Paris

625
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
to not sign in humiliation.

supporting the Peking University students' movement.

to not sign in humiliation.

632
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,520
Come and see, come and buy.

633
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,000
What's your name?

634
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,520
Xu Deheng.

635
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,720
How old are you?

636
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,840
Twenty-nine.

637
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:31,859
[Xu Deheng, styled Chusheng, Student at Peking University]

638
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,920
Such a treasurous young man.

639
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,840
How can you commit murder and arson?

640
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,560
We did nothing but treasure our country.

641
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,280
It's neither murder nor arson.

642
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,320
Patriotism?

643
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,320
You think you are patriotic?

644
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,840
Xu Deheng,

645
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,440
I just want to ask you one question.

646
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,680
You marched in the streets.

647
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,400
Who is behind this?

648
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
My head grows on my shoulder.

649
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,120
Do I need to be instructed by others?

650
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,200
But I heard

651
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,520
that you are a loyal follower to Li Dazhao

652
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,920
and Chen Duxiu.

653
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,160
Come on.

654
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,560
Have a glass of water first.

655
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
Tell me about it.

656
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,560
What have they told you recently?

657
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,680
Come and drink.

658
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,960
Chief Wu.

659
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,560
You flatter me.

660
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,200
Chen Duxiu is a famous scholar in China.

661
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
Li Dazhao is the director of the library.

662
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,760
I am just an ordinary student.

663
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,920
I can't even meet them casually.

664
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,840
How can I know what they said?

665
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,360
Xu Deheng, you know,

666
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
the reason I came to ask you myself today

667
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
is to give you a way out.

668
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,320
Why don't you cooperate?

669
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,040
I really want to cooperate with you, Chief Wu.

670
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
I told the whole truth and only the truth.

671
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
You can't be asking me to tell lies

672
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,160
as a way to cooperate.

673
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,960
Take him.

674
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,520
Yes.

675
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,800
Come in

676
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,880
Result?

677
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,440
These students are all in cahoots.

678
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,360
Confessions are all the same.

679
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Interrogate them all tonight.

680
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,680
Be sure to dig out the mastermind behind it.

681
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,720
Yes.

682
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,160
The situation has changed dramatically since May 5th.

683
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,760
The Beijing National Foreign Affairs Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Farmers Association

684
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,640
all sent letters to the government and put words out around the country,

685
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,960
that they support the student movement

686
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,120
and request the release of the arrested students.

687
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,000
Sun Wen, Linsen and Tang Shaoyi in the Southern government

688
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
along with Kang Youwei, Wu Peifu, Zhang Jingyao,

689
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
Chen Guangyuan and others expressed their support for the students,

690
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,080
demanding to remove Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, and Lu Zongyu from duty.

691
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
There are several senators in Congress

692
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,720
who have jointly sent a letter to the President

693
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,720
requesting the release of the arrested students.

694
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,080
Besides Beijing and Guangzhou,

695
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:30,880
Shanghai,

696
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,520
Nanjing,

697
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,000
Tianjin,

698
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,560
Wuhan,

699
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,120
Changsha,

700
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,920
activities in support of Beijing students also took place.

701
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,200
In the last two days,

702
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,640
the Presidential Palace and the State Council

703
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
have received messages of support.

704
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,800
More than one hundred of them.

705
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,280
Solidarity activities around the country show the following characteristics:

706
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,680
One, setting up student organizations

707
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,320
to implement various action plans.

708
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,080
Two, organizing demonstrations

709
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,160
to protest the government's foreign policy,

710
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,400
the Paris Peace Treaty and the arrest of the students.

711
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,960
Three, a full-scale boycott of Japanese goods.

712
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
All these indicate that

713
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,200
the government's crisis of trust has taken shape in an all-round way.

714
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
All right, all right, that's enough.

715
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,080
Everyone,

716
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
what countermeasures should we take?

717
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,160
Mr. President,

718
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,040
this is my third resignation letter.

719
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,040
I'm incompetent in carrying on my duty.

720
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,480
Please approve.

721
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,320
Fu Zengxiang, this is not your resignation.

722
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,240
This is blackmail.

723
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,040
At this time, you have to pick a fault.

724
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,320
No way.

725
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
I can resign without resigning.

726
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,120
Then let the arrested students go.

727
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
The students have been on strike for two days.

728
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,720
If it continues,

729
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,720
the situation will be unmanageable.

730
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,920
No way.

731
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,560
General Duan said that students can't go.

732
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,400
Cao Rulin has to stay in his position either.

733
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,920
Nonsense.

734
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,440
We have guns in our hands.

735
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
What harm can a few students do?

736
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,920
Who says they can't do harm.

737
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,760
The city of Beijing

738
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,840
has been turned upside down by students.

739
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,120
Do you know what the students are going to do?

740
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,840
They intend to launch a general mobilization to the whole society.

741
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,520
The newly established Beijing Federation of Students

742
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
are going to the streets,

743
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,800
going to the streets and the factories to give speeches.

744
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,760
They also plan to go to Shanghai, Wuhan, Changsha and other places.

745
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,880
Giving speeches,

746
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,360
planning to establish the National Federation of Students.

747
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,440
Now it's more than just the academics.

748
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
They also encouraged the business community.

749
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,160
Seeing that the military community is also dividing,

750
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,520
when May 7th comes,

751
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,600
as soon as the Central Park National Convention opens,

752
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,160
it will for sure be a volcanic eruption.

753
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,360
By then,

754
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,920
there's nothing you can do to help.

755
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,760
Chief Wu,

756
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,560
you are exaggerating.

757
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,000
Mr. President,

758
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
whether I am exaggerating or not,

759
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,120
please listen to the Premier's opinion.

760
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,160
Premier Qian,

761
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,480
are you pessimistic too?

762
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,160
My opinion

763
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,960
is even worse than Chief Wu's.

764
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,160
So,

765
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,600
what's the police chief's strategy?

766
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,680
I only have one strategy,

767
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,320
release the arrested students.

768
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,160
That will be slapping our faces.

769
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,040
Besides, what about General Duan's will?

770
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,400
Mr. President,

771
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,400
all I can say now is to release students.

772
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
If you must not let them go,

773
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,680
if there is any trouble in Beijing again,

774
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,200
I can't take the responsibility.

775
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,840
I also resign.

776
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,800
Jingtan,

777
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,360
don't be like a child now.

778
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,280
You come back.

779
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,280
Come back and sit down.

780
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,120
Premier Qian, you are the Premier of the State.

781
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,200
What do you think you should do?

782
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,720
My opinion

783
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,600
is exactly the same as Chief Wu's.

784
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,720
I see.

785
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,120
I see.

786
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,280
Since you are all share the same opinion,

787
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,760
I can agree to release the students.

788
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,560
But I have to ask you to be aware of two things.

789
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,000
First, make sure that in all schools,

790
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,840
all classes must resume on May 7th.

791
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,960
Second, ensure that all students and teachers

792
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,440
will not participate the National Convention at Central Park

793
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,360
on May 7th.

794
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,800
If anything goes wrong, I'll hold you all accountable.

795
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,600
Go ahead with the discussion.

796
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,600
Students!

797
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,080
In response to appeals from all walks of life,

798
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,720
with great kindness, the President

799
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,680
ordered to spare you for your recklessness.

800
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,440
We will also send cars to take you back to school.

801
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,880
I hope you can be grateful to the government.

802
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,680
Focus on study and stop making trouble.

803
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:40,960
Please.

804
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,480
Fellow students.

805
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,520
Principal Cai came in personal to pick you up.

806
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,640
Please.

807
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,320
Mr. Cai.

808
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,720
Mr. Zhongfu.

809
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,000
Chief Wu.

810
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,720
We are not leaving like this.

811
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,320
We fullly aware that

812
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,440
one more day of us being detained here,

813
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,160
one more day the people will be incited.

814
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,600
If all 32 people here

815
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
are sacrificed in this jail under your knife,

816
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,800
then 400 million Chinese people will be awakened.

817
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,720
We're not leaving.

818
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,440
We're staying all the way to the end.

819
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,080
All the way to the end.

820
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,360
To the end!

821
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,960
To the end!

822
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,240
Look at this, principal Cai.

823
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,080
What's this about?

824
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,560
Your spirit,

825
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,440
I admire it very much.

826
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,000
But I want you to know.

827
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,160
In order to rescue you,

828
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,520
teachers and students in many schools in Beijing

829
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,560
have made great sacrifices.

830
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,360
Schools will resume classes today.

831
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,600
Everyone is eager to see it through.

832
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,120
Everyone is Looking forward to your safe return to school.

833
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
Students, don't let down

834
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
hundreds of thousands of teachers and students in Beijing

835
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,880
with their sincere hearts.

836
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,920
Mr. Cai, you don't have to persuade us.

837
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,000
We appreciate your help.

838
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
I also yearn for a free life outside prison.

839
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,160
But, as long as it can awaken the Chinese people

840
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,400
even if we give our lives away,

841
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,560
we're willing to do it.

842
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,200
You-

843
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,960
You kids

844
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
are just so arrogant.

845
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,840
You think

846
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
to wake up a nation

847
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,600
trapped in a feudal mindset

848
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,360
for thousands of years

849
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,040
is that easy?

850
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,040
You think

851
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,040
to wipe out the numbness, indifference,

852
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,600
and inert thinking

853
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
from the blood of our nation

854
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,560
is a day's work?

855
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,680
It will take several generations

856
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
to strive for a great cause.

857
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,640
Let me tell you.

858
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,920
You have no right to die now.

859
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
This disaster-stricken country of ours

860
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,720
needs you stay alive,

861
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,800
needs you to fight!

862
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,360
Mr. Zhongfu.

863
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,880
We'll go with you.

864
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,880
So this is how you brought them back.

865
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
It's your style.

866
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,160
But sometimes you can be a bit bossy.

867
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,520
Am I?

868
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,920
I'm not overbearing.

869
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,600
They are confused.

870
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,040
Revolutionaries.

871
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,320
They can't do such a thing as killing themselves in the revolution?

872
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,920
You can be an alarm if you want,

873
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,040
but you have to respect a bomb's will to go without regret.

874
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,240
What do you mean?

875
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,600
For example,

876
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,520
there is this land

877
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,600
where a group of people are sleeping.

878
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
In the distance, there is a volcano

879
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,720
about to explode.

880
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,000
You are like an alarm clock.

881
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,840
Facing these sleeping people,

882
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,840
you want to wake them up.

883
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,840
So you keep ringing.

884
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,440
The ones sleeping lightly,

885
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,960
you woke them up.

886
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,880
They go with you to wake up the others.

887
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,960
But there are too many people,

888
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,880
your voice is too weak.

889
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,520
After all, there are only a few people who awaken.

890
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,800
And sometimes,

891
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,400
there are ones find you as a nuisance.

892
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
From time to time, they kick the alarm away.

893
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,120
Then there are alarm clocks that are afraid of being too late.

894
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,800
So they use their lives

895
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,560
as raw material

896
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,080
to turn into a bomb.

897
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,880
The explosion will awaken a large number of people.

898
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,720
Then, as you say,

899
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,120
the bomb is much more powerful than the alarm clock.

900
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,600
So all we need is few more bombs?

901
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,960
What's the use of an alarm clock then?

902
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,400
No.

903
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,920
Brother Zhongfu, think about it.

904
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,680
If it was not for the alarm clock

905
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,040
that kept ringing constantly and never stopped,

906
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,360
there wouldn't be any bomb.

907
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,280
Although the bomb is powerful,

908
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,640
it can't overcome people's inertia after all.

909
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,320
Only the alarm clock

910
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,360
keeps ringing, keeps reminding, keeps watching

911
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,640
to finally wake everyone up.
