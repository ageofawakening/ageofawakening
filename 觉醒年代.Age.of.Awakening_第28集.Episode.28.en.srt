00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,686
[Episode Twenty-eight]

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,600
Please be quiet.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,440
Quiet please

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,360
Mr Cai has arrived.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,960
Mr. Cai, classmates

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,080
Take to the streets today.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,560
It was the collective decision of all of us.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,840
So this consequence

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,920
Can't let the arrested 32 classmates

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,800
To undertake

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,840
I propose

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
All our classmates in Peking University

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,800
draw together

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:54,880


16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Turn yourself in at the door of the army commander.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,080
Respect prison

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,520
Pledge to defend our arrested classmates to the death

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,160
Vow to advance and retreat with the arrested classmates

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:04,480


21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,480
Vow to advance and retreat with the arrested classmates

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,120
Vow to advance and retreat with the arrested classmates

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,360
Let's be quiet first.

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,600
Let's listen to Mr Cai.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,120
I want to tell you.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
The more you encounter this situation.

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
The more we need to calm down.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,000
We are all scholars.

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,840
We are sensible.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,760
We are rational.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,360
We will never do it.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,160
That kind of mob thing

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,320
Students' patriotic actions

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,160
I Cai Yuanpei support it.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
But this happened.

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,320
Out of my expectation.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,800
I am very sad.

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,600
Very sad

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
For this reason, I am the principal

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,560
To resign

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,120
Take the blame and resign

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,800
But the most urgent thing now

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
Is to do everything possible.

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,480
To rescue the arrested 32 students.

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,440
I want them to come out safely.

46
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,080
I just got word that

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,760
Our arrested classmate

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
Has been transferred to the metropolitan police department.

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
I don't know whether you are worried or happy.

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,120
But I made up my mind.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
I want to go to the Metropolitan Police Department in person.

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Go to police chief Wu Bingxiang.

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
I want someone from him.

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,320
I'm going to take my classmates

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
Bring it back to school safely.

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
I ask my classmates to be patient at school.

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,600
Don't go out.

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
Listen to my news.

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Can everyone do it?

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
can

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,400
classmates

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
What Mr. Cai said just now

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
Is everyone listening?

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
We are going to make a

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
A patriotic Chinese.

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
But patriotic.

67
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
We need to calm down even more.

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,560
calm

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,120
okay

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,200
nicely

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
This meeting unanimously decided that

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
Closed Peking University

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Replace the president of Peking University

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
And severely deal with the arrested students.

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Instruct Wu Bingxiang, director of the Metropolitan Police Department.

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,240
Put forward the disposal plan for the arrested students.

77
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,520
Instruct Wu Bingxiang Chen Zhuan Fu Zengxiang

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
Responsible for stopping May 7th

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
The National Convention held in Central Park

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
Instruct the Ministry of Education

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,200
Responsible for restoring school order.

82
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,520
This meeting is over.

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,400
the meeting is over

84
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,240
Brother Cheng, I want to resign.

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,680
This errand

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
I really can't go on.

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
Uncle took the lead in the national disaster and left.

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
This is not your style.

89
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,600
I don't go.

90
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,360
What can I do without leaving?

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,320
The student parade was driven by patriotism.

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
But any sensible person can see it.

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,760
You arrested so many students.

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,960
Also close Peking University and replace Cai Heqing.

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
This will not only discourage students.

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Instead, it will add fuel to the fire

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,120
It is bound to lead to greater turmoil.

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
I can't follow you to this muddy water.

99
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,800
Yuan Shu lai lai lai

100
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:54,880


101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,480
Uncle lai lai lai

102
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Come on

103
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
You really don't understand my mind?

104
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
My idea is the same as yours.

105
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,520
But have you ever been to Duan Qirui?

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
Students burn Zhao Jialou.

107
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,360
Wound Zhang Zongxiang

108
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,320
Xu Shuzheng threatened to set up a cannon on Jingshan.

109
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
Raze Peking University to the ground.

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
under the circumstances

111
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
Don't you come up with some measures?

112
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,240
Have to explain the past?

113
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,360
You withdrew Cai Yuanpei.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,920
Who will be the president of Peking University?

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,920
Duan Qirui nominated Ma Qichang.

116
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,920
I was prevaricated.

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,040
Make a gesture first.

118
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
Let's talk about it when things calm down.

119
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
Now this Peking University

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,520
I think except Cai Yuanpei

121
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,960
No one can control it.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
Now the question is

123
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,160
The police arrested dozens of students.

124
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,160
This is the curse.

125
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,120
If they don't play it or something goes wrong

126
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,360
Then this will be a big deal.

127
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
We can't afford it.

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
Student affairs are very difficult.

129
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,040
The well-being people unanimously demanded severe punishment.

130
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
Only this Wu Bingxiang is smart.

131
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
He intends to make use of these students.

132
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
As Cai Yuanpei

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,120
And disintegration of students.

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,320
And I hope I can fully cooperate with him.

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
This Wu Bingxiang

136
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,360
But Duan Qirui's clique!

137
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,200
You can trust him.

138
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
He is also responsible.

139
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
To maintain public order in the capital.

140
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
Then you can't offend students.

141
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
Things are going to be big.

142
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
He was the first to be held accountable.

143
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
I look!

144
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,440
But it's hanging by a thread.

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,760
It's like walking a tightrope.

146
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,520
Be reluctant.

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,200
Big deal.

148
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
I resign with you.

149
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,120
These students

150
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,920
That's making trouble for bad friends.

151
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
You have to catch what you should catch.

152
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,080
Scratch, scratch, and you'll know a scratch.

153
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
Do you know anything else?

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,920
Can't you be soft on them?

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
Principal Cai, what do you want?

156
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,720
It's embarrassing for your subordinates.

157
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,920
Principal Cai, principal Cai

158
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,360
Don't make it difficult for your subordinates.

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,320
Principal Cai, principal Cai

160
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,520
Why did you give up?

161
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,400
He

162
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,480
Have to go in.

163
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,840
Go down.

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,160
be

165
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,440
Cai Yuanpei

166
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,000
How dare you come here?

167
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,840
I mean, what do you do?

168
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,080
what's up

169
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,280
Principal Cai, what can I do for you?

170
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
Yes, I am. For which?

171
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,200
Thirty-two students were arrested.

172
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,400
I would like to invite the metropolitan police department

173
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,000
Juntongling gate

174
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,600
Let my students go.

175
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
I'll take all the responsibility from Cai Yuanpei.

176
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
You still want to release people?

177
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
I think I should arrest you too.

178
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
If I let my students go

179
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,880
You can arrest me.

180
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
Principal Cai, you are exaggerating.

181
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,280
Where are the two of us?

182
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
Today, I was trained by President Xu Da.

183
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,480
be in a bad mood

184
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,520
Don't take it seriously.

185
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
But this arrest and release

186
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,840
It's not our function.

187
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,160
We're just errands.

188
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,440
Unless there is a warrant from the president.

189
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
The director, President Xu Da.

190
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,600
I must go to see him.

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,560
And I will never embarrass you two.

192
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Just tonight.

193
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,040
I would like to ask you two to do me a favor.

194
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,240
Let me take my classmates back tonight.

195
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
I must see President Xu Da tomorrow.

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
Even if I offered to resign

197
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
At the same time.

198
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,400
You are still the president of Peking University.

199
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
See the laws of the country as a joke.

200
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,480
Let people laugh.

201
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,840
These students of yours

202
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
Now he is a prisoner of the state.

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,840
Two places

204
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
I am Cai Yuanpei, a teacher.

205
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
Now my students are in trouble.

206
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,640
I should save each other.

207
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,400
Should come to care.

208
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,120
So I'd like to invite two officers

209
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,760
Can give me Cai Yuanpei's help

210
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,280
Are the two officers?

211
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
No child has ever been to school or studied.

212
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,600
Li Tongling said that the students were prisoners.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
I would like to ask

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
Do students act for themselves?

215
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
They are patriotic.

216
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,280
They are for that.

217
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,960
Unequal Paris Peace Treaty

218
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
This unequal Paris peace treaty

219
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,960
Aroused the anger of every Chinese.

220
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,800
You two

221
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Are public officials in the government of the Republic of China.

222
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,200
In your eyes

223
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
Patriotic students turned out to be prisoners

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,160
Ping the meaning of President Cai.

225
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,920
No, you can't tell me.

226
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
Cai Yuanpei

227
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,360
They say you're a tiger's ass.

228
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm going to kill you today.

229
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Let you know what the rules are.

230
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
Somebody get out of here!

231
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,120
Her students are just looking for trouble

232
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,240
Do wrong.

233
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
Catch what you should catch and kill what I should kill.

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,280
Let him go down and have a rest.

235
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,320
I can't cure you.

236
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,640
Principal Cai, you have seen it.

237
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,840
only if

238
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,400
There are orders from President Xu Da.

239
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,120
otherwise

240
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
There's really nothing we can do.

241
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,920
take one's time in reaching a decision

242
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,560
Director Wu

243
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:50,960
take one's time in reaching a decision

244
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,840
What? This is

245
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,960
Director Wu

246
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
China is Chinese.

247
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
You are also Chinese.

248
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
We marched in the streets for China.

249
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,400
What's wrong with us?

250
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
We are trying to make the government

251
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,040
Refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

252
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,320
Shandong is gone.

253
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
Is China still there?

254
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,080
That's right.

255
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Independence or death.

256
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,840
I would rather die than be independent.

257
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,240
Independence or death.

258
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
Independence or death.

259
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,400
Be quiet. This is a prison.

260
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
No matter how you are out there

261
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,720
Here

262
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,080
You have to follow the rules here.

263
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,360
Prisoners are not allowed to talk and play with each other.

264
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,200
When sleeping

265
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,560
Everyone must have a haircut every half hour.

266
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,080
Turn over

267
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
To prove that the prisoner is still alive

268
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
Prisoners can pee in the urinal.

269
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,960
The stool must be silly.

270
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
This is a violation of our human rights.

271
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,760
You have to follow the rules here.

272
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,680
Wait until noon the next day when the fresh air.

273
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,560
Can shit

274
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,000
You are violating our human rights.

275
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,880
I want to protest.

276
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
Yes, we want to protest.

277
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,240
Protest protest

278
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
Although you protest.

279
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,840
But the rules must be enforced.

280
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
Do you like to eat this thing?

281
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
You have to listen to us here.

282
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,640
Do you still have humanity?

283
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Isn't this bullying?

284
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,080
Is that they set fire to it without authorization.

285
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,720
Burn Zhao Jialou.

286
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,760
Disrupt the plan

287
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,360
Yes, it's their personal behavior.

288
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,400
Fu Sinian classmate

289
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
I think what happened today

290
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,280
You must take full responsibility.

291
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Can I take full responsibility for this?

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
I didn't agree to go to Zhao Jialou.

293
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,040
But when?

294
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
Who listens to me as the commander in chief?

295
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
Since no one listens to you as the commander in chief.

296
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,400
Then I suggest

297
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Revoke the post of commander-in-chief Fu Sinian.

298
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,840
I agree, I agree, I agree

299
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,040
good

300
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,120


301
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:47,520


302
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,440
I quit this commander in chief.

303
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,160
Don't do it

304
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,320
If you don't have money, you won't have it.

305
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,480
Don't do it

306
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:50,720
If you don't have money, you won't have it.

307
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:50,880
Don't do it

308
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
Let's re-elect now.

309
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
Don't go. It's not your fault.

310
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,800
Needless to say

311
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,880
Boys and girls, I propose

312
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,320
In order to strengthen

313
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,080
Organization and leadership of the student movement

314
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
Facilitate the communication between schools in Beijing.

315
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,520
Should be established.

316
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,280
Beijing College Student Affairs Association

317
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,280
I agree, I agree, I agree

318
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Okay, it's an emergency. No choice

319
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
Directly by Deng Zhongxia Huangrikui Zhang Guotao

320
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
Kang Baiqing Chen Baohao has five people.

321
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,440
For a thousand things.

322
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:15,920
Be an officer of the office.

323
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000


324
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
Raise your hand if you agree.

325
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
Agreed, agreed, agreed

326
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,680
pass

327
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,120
Will the classmates come to the meeting.

328
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
big

329
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:27,840


330
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,560
Take a look.

331
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,160
Try my best to rescue the arrested classmates.

332
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,480
Students, students, students

333
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,440
Listen to me.

334
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,920
Mr Cai's negotiation with Wu Bingxiang is invalid.

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,680
Has returned to school from the metropolitan police department.

336
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,040
I'm on the phone right now.

337
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,560
Contact principals of various schools in Beijing.

338
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,160
Go to Peking University for a meeting tomorrow

339
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
Discuss the rescue of the arrested students.

340
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,960
What should I do?

341
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:48,880


342
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:49,600


343
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,960
Jialun jialun

344
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,720
Mid-summer, mid-summer

345
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
All the students from normal universities flocked to the playground.

346
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,080
Call unanimously for a strike.

347
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,040
Rescue the arrested classmates

348
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,320
I suggest Peking University take the lead.

349
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,360
Contact Beijing universities urgently.

350
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,800
Implement a general strike

351
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,680
Okay, add it.

Here, add this one.

353
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,840
This class can't be attended.

354
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,320
Yes, no problem.

355
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,880
Then I announced it.

356
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay, okay, announce it, announce it

357
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,040
Students, students

358
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,400
Be quiet and listen to me.

359
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,200
Upon urgent consultation by the Student Affairs Council.

360
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,760

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,080
Wudiantong National Education Association Chamber of Commerce

381
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,680
To action

382
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,800
Do you have any objections?

383
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,680
not have

384
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
If there is no objection, please act immediately.

385
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,440
Let's go, let's go.

386
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,400
have a walk

387
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Shouchang, when did we meet?

388
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,800
In Japan in 1915, right?

389
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
Because of your "patriotism and self-awareness"

390
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,720
Be besieged

391
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
We had a long talk.

392
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,120
Yeah, that's why I'm conscious.

393
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,520
I went back to China to run New Youth.

394
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,840
Because I saw your New Youth.

395
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
Eliminates the misunderstanding to you.

396
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,840
To join your camp.

397
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
New Youth has been running for almost four years.

398
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,840
I feel

399
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,520
It has reached a real turning point today.

400
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
I have a hunch that today

401
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
It will be a big day in Chinese history.

402
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,440
It's from today.

403
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
We should not only shout.

404
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,080
It's even more important to take practical actions.

405
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,800
Shouchang, I have a question for you

406
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,160
You said

407
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,560
When I started New Youth

408
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,560
I put forward a goal.

409
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,440
To find a truth for China

410
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,040
A road

411
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,320
I want to ask you

412
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,800
Did you find it today?

413
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,280
I think I found it.

414
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Truth is Marxism.

415
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,440
The road is the Russian October Revolution.

416
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,720
Are you sure?

417
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
In the process of being determined.

418
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,080
中富兄

419
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,200
I recently wrote an article.

420
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,400
My View of Marxism

421
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Want to publish it in New Youth.

422
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,280
Are you okay with that?

423
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,760
Of course, I started from the second half of last year

424
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
Pay close attention to Marx's works.

425
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,240
First half of this year

426
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,720
Every issue of New Youth is published and introduced.

427
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,840
Marxist articles

428
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,840
Especially last month's Weekly Review.

429
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,520
Published Marx's

430
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,800
Chapter II of the Communist Manifesto

431
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,320
Have a great response.

432
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,120
My thoughts also touched me a lot.

433
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,400
Manifesto of the Communist Party

434
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,640
It is a classic work of Marx and Engels.

435
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
Very wonderful and profound.

436
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
I can recite many paragraphs.

437
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,040
To be honest.

438
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,040
Although I'm not as sure as you are.

439
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,000
But my interest in Marxism

440
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,840
It's getting stronger and stronger

441
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,600
As for the October Revolution in Russia and China

442
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,120
I feel the same way.

443
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,280
I didn't do much research.

444
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,880
But I think

445
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,480
Compared with Britain, France and America

446
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,680
The Russian way is more suitable for China.

447
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,480
Shouchang, I really want to have a chance to have time

448
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
The two of us carefully and well

449
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,800
Discuss this problem.

450
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,480
I also have a lot of ideas and questions.

451
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
I want to discuss with you

452
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,280
Things happen today.

453
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,800
It's very exciting for me.

454
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,240
I'm thinking.

455
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,080
Maybe from today.

456
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,040
We're going to take a road together.

457
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
The road of direct confrontation with the reactionary government

458
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,320
Shouchang

459
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,840
How do you think this road should go?

460
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,360
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a long time

461
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,160
I think what you said is right.

462
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,680
We have to let the people

463
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,960
Come out and solve the problem directly.

464
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
We students alone can't do it.

465
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
We must mobilize the masses to fight.

466
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,920
Yeah, today was just a trigger.

467
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,000
Our mission

468
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
Is to use it to detonate the whole of China.

469
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,800
Let all walks of life in the country take action.

470
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,160
Get them directly involved.

471
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,000
In the struggle to transform the whole society.

472
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,800
Only this China has hope.

473
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
Our past "New Youth"

474
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
Just focus on ideological enlightenment.

475
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
Now we have to make it clear that

476
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
The task of fundamentally transforming society

477
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,720
This is our responsibility.

478
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,560
good

479
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,160
Our weekly review.

480
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,880
And New Youth.

481
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,600
Two publications

482
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
Do more articles in this area.

483
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,040
We will start tonight.

484
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,040
Try to get out tomorrow.

485
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
中富兄

486
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,200
You remind me of that sentence again.

487
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
Let the storm come more violent.

488
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,400
go

489
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,920
To maintain order and rectify the style of study.

490
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,840
All schools are ordered to strictly investigate May 4th.

491
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,680
Fire in Zhao Jialou

492
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,840
To the student who caused the trouble.

493
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,440
Dismissal

494
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,720
Not appealable

495
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,880
That is, follow

496
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,680
This order

497
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,480
What do you mean?

498
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,280
They don't have to be fired.

499
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,800
We can't learn this.

500
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
I can't get on. I can't get on

501
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,560
Strike, strike, strike

502
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:46,640


503
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,600
Strike, strike, strike

504
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,840
ladies and gentlemen

505
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:40,560


506
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,600
Great sages gathered in our metropolitan police department.

507
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,280
It's really flattering.

508
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,360
Please come inside, please.

509
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,320
I don't know what you have in mind.

510
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
Dear Director Hao

511
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
We are all principals of major schools in Beijing.

512
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,240
We're all here for bail today.

513
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,840
Thirty-two students who were arrested came.

514
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
Director Hao, please grant permission.

515
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,600
Principal Cai, you were immediately dismissed.

516
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,680
How can you care about the students?

517
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,160
You will not be dismissed.

518
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,920
It doesn't really matter.

519
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,040
These students

520
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,280
She will always be my Cai Yuanpei's student.

521
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,680
Besides, the behavior of students marching in the streets

522
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He's not unreasonable.

523
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,640
Is not looking for trouble.

524
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
He did it for the unequal Paris Peace Treaty.

525
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
And marched on the streets.

526
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
We support their actions.

527
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,160
If you want to be held accountable

528
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
Then pursue us.

529
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,480
Director Wu

530
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
As long as you release the arrested classmates

531
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,320
Several of our principals will resign collectively.

532
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,000
To resign collectively.

533
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,880
resign (office/one's job/post)

534
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,920
President Chen

535
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,480
It's none of my business whether you resign or not.

536
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,600
This thing about releasing students.

537
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
It's not really under the authority.

538
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,760
I can't be the master.

539
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,360
at this point

540
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,240
I last night.

541
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,480
President Cai has made it clear.

542
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
I hope you, Dae-hyun

543
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,240
Don't embarrass me

544
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Director Wu

545
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,400
Now all schools in Beijing will start a general strike.

546
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,040
It is these arrested students who are the cause.

547
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,320
If things get too big

548
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,600
The consequences are unimaginable.

549
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
Especially you.

550
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,960
Shoulder the general responsibility of social security in the capital.

551
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
You should think twice.

552
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,760
I thank you for reminding me.

553
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,600
Great sages all know.

554
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,880
You are a guest of a high-ranking political official.

555
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,560
Let me remind you, too.

556
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,440
You say

557
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
As long as you can stay with President Xu.

558
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
Ask for a warrant

559
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,600
Brother, how about releasing people immediately?

560
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,920
Can you bend the rules?

561
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,520
Don't do that

562
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,240
You let us do student work.

563
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,960
Right.-Right

564
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,080
You release people.

565
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,120
Let's do student work.

566
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
I said, gentlemen, gentlemen

567
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
This is the police department.

568
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,920
It's not a vegetable market

569
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
How can you bargain?

570
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
I understand your feelings.

571
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
I'm just sick. I'm in a hospital.

572
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,960
Wrong temple gate

573
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,640
I advise you to find Xu Shichang.

574
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,160
I'm busy with business.

575
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,080
Please go back, please go back.

576
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
If you big sages insist on not leaving.

577
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,160
Folk prescription for tea

578
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,120
Make tea, make tea

579
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,400
Gentlemen, please.

580
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,120
wait a moment

581
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Brother Tan, please stay.

582
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
It turns out that the fellow villagers have arrived.

583
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,280
Lose one's welcome

584
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me.

585
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,640
We are from the same town but different departments.

586
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,680
Two cars on the road.

587
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,200
I dare not climb high.

588
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Chairman Wang is here.

589
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,320
What instructions?

590
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,920
Let's talk inside.

591
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,720
Say it right here.

592
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,680
I'm here to submit a bail submission.

593
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,280
Who are you bailing out?

594
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,080
Me and Wang Chonghui Lin Changmin.

595
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,800
Bail 32 students arrested jointly.

596
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,520
This is a bail petition.

597
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
Let me read it to you.

598
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
No, I'll see for myself

599
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Wu Bingxiang

600
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
Are you going to listen or not?

601
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,840
I listen

602
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,480
listen to

603
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm all ears.

604
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,160
Steal the fourth day of this month

605
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,520
Students from various schools in Beijing

606
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,440
Call for diplomatic issues

607
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The gathering of people led to the brewing incident

608
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,160
In the noisy field at that time

609
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,400
More than 30 students were arrested.

610
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,880
Stimulate the nation into excesses.

611
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,000
It's sad.

612
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,160
And this more than 30 people

613
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
Not necessarily the person who caused the accident.

614
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,040
Wait for Date to be released on bail first.

615
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,560
If you need to interrogate in the future

616
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
That is to say, the case is delivered by the big guarantee.

617
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
It's hard to know how exciting things are.

618
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,520
For this reason, it is urgent to be frank.

619
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,600
Fortunately for the people.

620
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
Just you guys!

628
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
This release of students

629
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,280
There must also be the approval of President Xu Da.

630
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,440
I hope you can understand my difficulties.

Is also a great person!

How can you commit murder and arson?

654
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,560
What we did was patriotic.

655
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,280
It's not murder and arson.

656
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,320
love one's country

657
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,320

Xu Deheng

659
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,440
I just want to ask you one question.

660
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,680
You marched in the streets.

661
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,400
Who is behind your boss?

662
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
My head grows on my shoulder.

663
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,120
Do I need to be instructed by others?

664
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,200
How did I hear?

665
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,520
你是李大钊

666

667
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,160

668
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,560
Have a glass of water first.

669
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
Tell me about it

670
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,560
What have they told you recently?

671
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,680
Come and drink

672

673
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,560
You flatter me.

674
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,200
He, Chen Duxiu, is a famous scholar in China.

675
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
Li Dazhao is the director of the library.

676
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,760
I am just an ordinary student.

677
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,920
I can't even meet them at ordinary times.

678
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,840
How do you know what they said?

679
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,360
Xu De, you know

680
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
I came to ask you myself today.

681
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
Is to give you an open hand.

682
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,320
Why don't you cooperate?

683
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,040
I really want to cooperate with you, Director Wu.

684
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
So what I just said is true.

685
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
You can't let me tell lies.

686
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,160
Come and cooperate with you.

687
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,960

What are you asking?

691
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,440
These students are all in cahoots.

692
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,360
Confessions are all the same.

693
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Interrogate all night

694
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,680
Be sure to dig out the mastermind behind it.

695
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,720
be

696
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,160

Beijing National Foreign Affairs Association Chamber of Commerce Farmers Association

698
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,640
All sent letters to the government and sent electricity to the whole country.

699
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,960
Support the student movement

700
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,120
Request the release of the arrested students.

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
And Kang Youwei, Wu Peifu and Zhang Jingyao.

703
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
Chen Guangyuan and others expressed their support for the students.

704
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,080
Ask Cao Rulin Zhang Zongxiang to remove Lu Zongyu.

705
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
There are several senators in Congress.

706
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,720
Have jointly sent a letter to the President.

707
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,720
Request the release of the arrested students.

708
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,080

Changsha

714
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,920
Activities in support of Beijing students also took place.

715
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,200
In the last two days

716
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,640
Presidential Palace and State Council

717
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
Received a message of solidarity with Beijing.

718
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,800
More than one hundred copies

719
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,280
Solidarity activities around the world show the following characteristics

720
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,680
Set up student organizations

721
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,320
To be responsible for implementing various action plans.

722
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,080
Organize demonstrations

3. Completely boycott Japanese goods.

726
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
All these indicate that

727
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,200
The government's crisis of trust has taken shape in an all-round way.

728
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
All right, all right, let's not talk about it

729
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,080
Let's see.

730
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
What countermeasures should we take?

731
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,160
president

732
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,040
This is my third resignation.

733
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,040
I'm really incompetent.

734
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,480
Please approve

735
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,320
Fu Zengxiang, this is not your resignation.

736
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,240
This is blackmail.

737
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,040
At this time, you have to pick a fault.

738
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,320
No way.

739
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
No, you can resign.

740
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,120
Then release the arrested students.

741
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
Students have been on strike for two days.

742
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,720
Continue to develop.

743
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,720
The situation will be unmanageable.

744
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,920
impossible

745
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,560
Duan Dashuai said that students can't play it.

746
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,400
Cao Rulin can't go either.

747
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,920
I don't believe it.

748
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,440
We have guns in our hands.

749
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
Let every student turn the sky upside down?

750
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,920
Who says students can't be proud?

751
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,760
This Beijing city

752
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,840
Has been turned upside down by students.

753
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,120
Do you know what the students below are going to do?

754
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,840
They intend to launch a general mobilization to the whole society.

755
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,520
The newly established Beijing Federation of Students

756
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
They are going to the streets.

757
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,800
Go to the street club factory to give a speech.

758
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,760
I also plan to go to Shanghai, Wuhan, Changsha and other places.

759
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,880
Give a speech

760
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,360
Organize the National Federation of Students.

761
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,440
Now it's not just academia.

762
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
They also encouraged the business community.

763
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,160
Seeing that the military community is also dividing.

764
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,520
Wait until May 7th.

765
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,600
As soon as the Central Park National Convention opens

766
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,160
It must be a volcanic eruption.

767
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,360
until this moment

768
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,920
There's nothing you can do to help.

769
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,760
Director Wu

770
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,560
Have you listened to the dangerous words?

771
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,000
president

772
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
I'm Wu Bingxiang's alarmist.

773
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,120
Please listen to the Prime Minister's opinion.

774
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,160
Premier Qian

775
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,480
Are you so pessimistic?

776
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,160
My opinion

777
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,960
Even worse than Director Hao.

778
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,160
such being the case

779
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,600
What's your police chief's strategy?

780
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,680
My response is only one.

781
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,320
Is to release the arrested students.

782
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,160
Doesn't releasing students hit themselves in the face?

783
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,040
Besides, what about the old section?

784
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,400
president

785
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,400
I only mean the release of students.

786
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
If you must not let it go.

787
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,680
If there is any trouble in Beijing again

788
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,200
I'm irresponsible.

789
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,840
I also resign.

790
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,800
Jingtan

791
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,360
What kind of childish behavior does Jing Tan play?

792
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,280
you come back

793
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,280
Come back and sit down.

794
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,120
Premier Qian, you are the Premier of the State.

795
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,200
What do you think you should do?

796
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,720
My opinion

797
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,600
Exactly the same as Director Wu.

798
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,720
good

799
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,120
good

800
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,280
Since you are all in this opinion.

801
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,760
I can agree to release the students.

802
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,560
But I have asked you to stay at two o'clock.

803
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,000
First, make sure that all schools

804
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,840
Classes must resume on May 7th.

805
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,960
The second stone is to ensure that all students and teachers

806
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,440
May 7th will not be allowed to participate.

807
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,360
Central Park National Congress

808
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,800
If anything goes wrong, I'll ask you.

809
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,600
Go ahead with the discussion.

810
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,600
Students!

811
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,080
In response to appeals from all walks of life

812
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,720
With great kindness, the president

813
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,680
Order to forgive you for your recklessness.

814
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,440
Our hall will also send a car to take you back to school.

815
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,880
I hope you can be grateful to the government.

816
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,680
Peace of mind to study and stop making trouble.

817
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:40,960
Please

818
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,480
Fellow students

819
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,520
The headmaster of Ji personally picked you up.

820
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,640
Please

821
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,320
Mr. Cai

822
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,720
中富先生

823
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,000
Director Wu

824
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,720
it is easier to invite sb in than to send him away

825
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,320
We are very clear.

826
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,440
I'll wait for the students to be detained here for one more day.

827
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,160
One more day to stimulate the people.

828
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,600
If I wait for 32 people.

829
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
Killed by Jieer, etc.

830
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,800
It can wake up 400 million people in China.

831
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,720
We're not leaving.

832
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,440
We're going to put you in jail.

833
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,080
Wear the base firmly.

834
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,360
Sit through the prison floor

835
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,960
Sit through the prison floor

836
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,240
Look at principal Cai.

837
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,080
What's this about?

838
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,560
Your spirit

839
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,440
I admire Cai Yuanpei very much

840
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,000
But I want to tell my classmates.

841
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,160
In order to rescue you

842
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,520
Teachers and students in many schools in Beijing

843
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,560
Have made great sacrifices.

844
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,360
Schools will resume classes today.

845
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,600
Everyone is eager to see it through.

846
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,120
Looking forward to your safe return to school.

847
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
Students, don't let down.

848
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,280
Hundreds of thousands of teachers and students in Beijing

849
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,360


850
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,320
Hundreds of thousands of teachers and students in Beijing

851
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,880
To your sincere heart!

852
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,920
Mr. Cai, you don't have to persuade us.

853
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,000
We appreciate your help.

854
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
I also yearn for a free life outside prison.

855
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,160
As long as it can awaken the Chinese people

856
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,400
Even if we give our lives

857
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,560
I'm willing to do my best.

858
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,200
you

859
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,960
It's really

860
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
It's not just arrogance.

861
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,840
You think

862
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
Wake up a

863
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,600
Feudal thought

864
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,360
A nation that has been banned for thousands of years

865
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,040
Is it that easy?

866
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,040
You think

867
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,040
To wipe out our nation.

868
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,600
Numbness and indifference in the blood

869
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
Inertial thinking

870
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,560
Is it a day's work?

871
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,680
It will take several generations.

872
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Strive for a great cause

873
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,640
Let me tell you something.

874
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,920
You have no right to die now.

875
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Our disaster-stricken country

876
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,720
You need to live.

877
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,800
You need to fight.

878
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,360
中富先生

879
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,880
We'll go with you.

880
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,880
So this is how you brought them back.

881
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
It's your style

882
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,160
But sometimes you can be a bit bossy.

883
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,520
Am I overbearing

884
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,920
I'm not overbearing.

885
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,600
They are too confused.

886
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,040
revolutionary

887
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,320
How can you do something that kills yourself in the revolution?

888
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,920
What about your alarm clock?

889
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,040
You have to respect the bomb rejection, too.

890
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,240
What do you mean?

891
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,600
For example.

892
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,520
On a piece of land

893
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,600
Lying a group of sleeping people.

894
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
The volcano is in the distance.

895
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,720
It's about to explode.

896
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,000
You are like an alarm clock.

897
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,840
Facing these sleeping people

898
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,840
You want to wake them up?

899
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,840
You keep ringing.

900
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,440
Some people who sleep lightly.

901
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,960
You woke me up.

902
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,880
Go with you to wake everyone up.

903
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,960
But there are too many people.

904
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,880
Your voice is too weak.

905
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,520
After all, there are limited people to wake up.

906
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,800
And it's uneven.

907
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,400
Some people are bored.

908
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
From time to time, I also break two.

909
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,120
Some alarm clocks are too late.

910
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,800
Take your own life.

911
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,560
As raw material

912
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,080
Turned into a bomb

913
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,880
It woke up a large number of people.

914
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,720
Then, as you say.

915
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,120
The bomb is much more powerful than the alarm clock.

916
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,600
Then just a few more bombs?

917
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,960
What's the use of an alarm clock?

918
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,400
No, yeah

919
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,920
Brother Zhongfu, think about it

920
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,680
Without the alarm clock

921
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,040
Day and night, "the emperor screamed with painstaking efforts."

922
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,360
There will be no bomb.

923
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,280
Although the bomb is powerful

924
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,640
But it can't overcome people's inertia after all.

925
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,320
Only the sieve clock is needed.

926
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,360
Keep reminding, keep watching.

927
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,640
To finally wake everyone up.
