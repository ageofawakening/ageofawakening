154
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,040
I went to see the old residence of Confucius and his cemetery.

155
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,640
And burned incense stick too.

156
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,720
I would have asked you to do the same thing on my behalf.

157

So to ask Confucius to cut me some slack.

158
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,600
And to critisize Yuan Shikai instead of me.

159

160
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,400
had the whole nation condemning him.

161

Isn't it?

162
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,400
To be honest.

163
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
I do admire Confucius

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,840
from the bottom of my heart.

165
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
If there is a chance

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,080
I'll also go to Qufu to burn a incense stick to pay my respect.

168
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,960
I think Confucius wouldn't mind you do so.

169
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,320
Because he understands,

170
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,240
that he is just a portrait now.

171
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,560
As for how to paint it, it's a matter for future generations.

172

all the peaceful petitions we had,  

183
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560

184

Now, with warlords at each others' throats,

185
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
we might can take this chance and finally put an end to Zhang's cruelty. 

186
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
But after we get rid of Zhang JIngyao,

187
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
how we should do with the autonomy in Hunan？

188
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
I have no clue about it.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,720
Here is my view.

190
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
As long as we have the so-called supervisor general system,

191
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
this world will be still under control of those ones who only know how to shoot guns.

192
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,000
We call it democratic republic,

193
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,880
whilst in fact it is warlords taking turns showing their power,

194
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
stealing from the people and betraying this country.

195
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,960
You want to talk petition, improve people's livelihood

196
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
and better system with them?

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,920
You might well ask a tiger for its skin.

198
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
Sir, you are absolutely right.

199
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,560
This country is sick in it's bones.

200
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
I don't know which medicine is the right one,

201
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
but even with the slightest hope, I will try them all

202
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,040
Though the efforts needed is tremendous.

203
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
I have always thought it's okay if we do it slowly,

204
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
with enlightenment education, awakening Chinese people gradually. 

205
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Step by step.

206
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
But now there is no time.

207
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Inside we have warlords, outside we have foreign enemies.

208
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,840
If we do it slowly,

209
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
China will be split apart before we realize it,

210
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
we will always be under their fingers.

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
The core to save our nation,

212
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,440
I think it is to take action immediately.

213
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,440
Sir.

214
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
Then, in your opinion,

215
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,680
what kind of ideology is the guideline to save the nation?

216
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
Marx and Lenin showed us the way.

217
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,960
Take a look.

218
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,080
Chen Wangdao finished this just now.

219
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,280
The translated full version

220
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
of The Communist Manifesto.

221
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
This is the guideline of salvation.

222
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm doing the proofread so it can be published as soon as possible.

223
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,840
A fully translated Communist Manifesto?

224
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,480
What I read in Beijing before were all only paragraphs. 

225
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
I've never read the full thing.

226
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,040
Sir.

227
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Can I read it first?

228
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Of course, not only that.

229
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,800
Runzhi

230
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I wish you could join me.

231
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I wish you could also be a believer in the Communist Party.

232
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
I think I will.

233
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,800
Before I only read some paragraphs,

234
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
but those alone

235
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
has made my heart pounding so hard. 

236
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,440
Good.

237
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
Here, Runzhi.

238
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,080
Don't go anywhere today. 

239
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Stay here.

240
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
You can finish reading it in one go!

241
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
Yes, please.

242
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Members of our Marxist Research Association

243
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
are from three organizations.

244
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
New Youth magazine,

245
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
Weekly Review magazine,

246
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,720
and the Current Affairs News.

247
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,520
Today, we are have a seminar.

248
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,880
Everyone knows,

249
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
not long ago,

250
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,960
Voitinsky from Communist International came to China.

251
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
I have met him.

252
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
Voitinsky stayed in China for more than a month.

253
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
In Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jinan and other places

254
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
he has met many people,

255
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,520
also learned a lot about the current situation.

256
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,360
Comrade Zhao Shiyan will share with us about

257
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,600
Comrade Voitinsky's thoughts and ideas.

258
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,560
Please feel free to change your ideas.

259
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,240
About the Chinese ideology research and political circle

260
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,080
if anyone is keen to discuss,

261
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,280
discussion is always welcomed.

262
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
Here are some Comrade Voitinsky's opinions.

263
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
The tide of new culture movement in China is surging unstoppably,

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
but first, the contents is too complicated.

265
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,880
There is anarchism,

266
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,920
unionism,

267
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,280
socialism,

268
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
Kilt socialism. 

269
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
All kinds of theory going around without a dominant one.

270
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
This kind of chaotic situation

271
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
is not helping us to reach a common idea.

272
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,840
Second, there is no organization.

273
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
We have too many people with too many empty talk. 

274
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
What about the actual action though?

275
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,200
This is in no way beneficial in starting a revolution in this country.

276
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,560
So he believes that

277
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,880
the most urgent task

278
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,080
for the Chinese ideology research and political circle

279
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,840
is to build as soon as possible,

280
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,600
one firm and strong

281
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
Marxist political party.

282
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't agree with Voitinsky.

283
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
He doesn't know China at all.

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There are too many political parties and factions in China now.

285
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
There is no point forming a small party now at all.

286
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
It's not going to work.

287
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,640
I think

288
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Comrade Voitinsky's opinion makes sense.

289
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,640
Without the strong leadership of a proletarian party

290
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
China can't form a united force now.

291
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,640
I have always thought that

292
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
China's top priority is to develop industry.

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
We must first utilise capitalism,

294
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
then we will work to achieve socialism.

295
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,400
Following the path and direction of Russia right now

296
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,160
will be unrealistic.

297
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Comrades

298
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I think it is urgent for China to build a political party. 

299
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:46,320
I agree.

300
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,600
Watch it.

301
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm sorry

302
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,760
Runzhi

303
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,040
I have successfully completed the task you gave me.

304
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,480
Shanghai celebrities from all walks of life

305
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
are all very supportive of work-studying in France.

306
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
They also cares a lot about Hunan's reform movement.

307
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,280
Everyone took part in donation.

308
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
20,000 silver dollars was quickly raised.

309
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,720
How about that.

310
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,800
You didn't come all the way here for nothing.

311
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,920
Twenty thousand silver dollar.

312
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,960
So many.

313
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,200
Mr. Zhang, thank you very much.

314
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,880
The money came just in time. 

315
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
When the revolution is successful, we will pay it back. 

316
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,214
Revolution?

317
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:47,159
Revolution, huh?

318
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
What kind of revolution are you talking about? 

319
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,880
Socialist revolution, of course.

320
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
Can it be done in China?

321
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,720
It's too difficult.

322
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,440
Nevertheless, we must overcome many difficulties.

323
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,240
Risks and dangers right ahead waiting,

324
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,611
I am still taking this path.

325
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,400
Well-said. Can I live to see it?

326
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,120
You can see it. Trust me.

327
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,080
We revolutionary,

328
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
we keep our word and our deeds.

329
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,840
Me, Mao Zedong honor my word.

330
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,200
Fine, I will be waiting for you to pay back the money.

331
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:28,880
Zhang Shizhao, famous activist/educationist/politcis, passed away in HongKong in year 1973.

332
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,200
Mrs. Chen, that's enough. There's too much to take. 

333
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,840
Nonsense, it's a long way to France.

334
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
You can have it all on the way.

335
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,040
Those are all specialties.

336
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,520
You won't be able to find them when you are in France.

337
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
Exactly, it's too far away.

338
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,400
And it's hot.

339
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm afraid these will go bad.

340
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,120
Shiyan

341
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
You are going to France now.

342
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
In addition to work-study programs

343
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
there is another important task for you.

344
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,920
That is to actively promote and learn more about Marxism 

345
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,280
among those other students in France.

346
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,600
Prepare for the establishment of our organization.

347
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,400
I will write to you often too.

348
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,960
Besides, please.

349
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,960
Visit Yannian and Qiaonian more. 

350
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,720
The situation of work-study program in France is very complicated. 

351
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
Yannian can get stubborn sometime.

352
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
I worry about him.

353
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
These are some Chinese materials 

354
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,840
I prepared for them.

355
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,960
You take it with you.

356
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,400
You tell them

357
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,720
I won't be able to die in peace

358
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,760
if they dont believe in Marxism.

359
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Leave it to me.

360
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,160
Don't worry.

361
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,000
I've sealed it tight for you.

362
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,040
It will be finr

363
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,840
Haiwei

364
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,520
Mrs. Chen.

365
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,680
Now you are all leaving,

366
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,520
I don't know when I will see you again.

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
Bai Lan, we'll entrust her to you.

368
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,920
Be sure to take care of her.

369
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
Mrs.Chen, rest assured.

370
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,880
When we are in France,

371
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,400
I will do my best.

372
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,320
Sister Bai lan.

373
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
Brother Yannian gave it to me.

374
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,360
Take it with you, it can keep you company on the way.

375
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Zi mei, I won't take Yingying with me this time.

376
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,240
That's because

377
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,360
I'm going on a long journey,

378
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,640
and it's by boat.

379
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm afraid Yingying won't like it.

380
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,120
Okay, but Sister Bai Lan

381
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
you need to tell

382
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Brother Yannian and Qiaonian that

383
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,040
Mom, dad, little brother and I

384
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
we miss them very much.

385
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
Okay, I will.

386
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
All done, time to go. 

387
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
It's getting late. Don't miss the boat.

388
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
Put it back and feed it some water. 

389
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,600
Grab your stuff.

390
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,360
Let's go.

391
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,560
Shouchang, work for building our party is under way.

392
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,680
Communist international urges east Asia secretariat 

393
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
to hurry on the process of setting up the organization in China.

394
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,360
Comrade Lenin

395
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
Comrade Trotsky

396
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,480
And Comrade Stalin.

397
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,040
Are very concerned about China's situation.

398
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,560
We plan to set up the party's initiating group in advance in August.

399
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
So we can provide an example for other places.

400
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,080
Currently I'm working on draw up a draft 

401
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
of the party's temporary program.

402
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,760
I share it with you now so we can have some discussion and modification.

403
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,960
As for the name of this party.

404
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
It's still uncertain.

405
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,358
Some people want to call it the Socialist Party.

406
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,049
Some the Social Communist Party.

407
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:50,198
Also some the Social Democratic Party.

408
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
Many options.

409
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
How should we call it?

410
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
I'd like to hear your opinion.

411
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,920
Brother Zhongfu, I have received your letter.

412
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,080
We here in Beijing

413
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
are working nonstoppedly as I'm writing this letter right now.

414
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,320
We plan to hold work with the Chinese Youth Society, 

415
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,800
the Twilight Group, the Humanity Club, the Youth Mutual Aid Group 

416
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,120
and Tianjin Awakeness Society, etc.

417
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,560
to hold a symposium together in the near future

418
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,560
where commonly-concerned issues will be discussed.

419
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,960
We are eager to see the establishment of the party's initiating group

420
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,080
takes place in Shanghai as soon as possible.

421
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,840
So that it can be an example for all of us.

422
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
As for the name of the party

423
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
I firmly believe that 

424
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,040
it should be the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

425
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,640
come on

426
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,600
Come, Runzhi.

427
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.

428
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,800
Come here.

429
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,080
Come and sit.

430
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,880
Thank you, sir

431
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,040
You been busy recently?

432
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
Haven't seen you in a long timw.

433
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,600
Me and some classmates from Hunan First Normal University

434
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,600
rented places in Minxiang South.

435
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,600
We are having a trial run with work-study life.

436
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,480
It's been a month so far.

437
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,520
It's really hard.

438
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,040
Work-study is not easy.

439
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
Chen Yannian did experiments for two months.

440
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,400
Failed

441
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,360
Then I heard that 

442
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
Wang Guangqi had a large-scale one,

443
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
also failed.

444
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,040
What about you?

445
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
We are engaged in a small experiment of several people.

446
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,560
You probably have guessed the result.

447
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,600
You failed too.

448
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,680
Yes.

449
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,360
But sir

450
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,120
I've made my decision now.

451
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
I will stop going to school from now on.

452
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,680
I want to focus on independent research.

453
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,560
Good.

454
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,360
Sir

455
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,640
Manifesto of the Communist Party

456
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I carefully read it over and over again.

457
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
I can confirm now that

458
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,120
I believe in Marxism.

459
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280
For sure?

460
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,280
Sir

461
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
Once my faith is established

462
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,120
it will not waver.

463
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
I will fight to the end to achieve communism.

464
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,600
Good

465
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,960
Runzhi

466
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
That's the kind of decision you need.

467
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,720
I'm very happy to hear that

468
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,240
you want to join us.

469
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,640
From this moment we are comrades. 

470
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,240
Sir

471
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,040
What is the name of our party?

472
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,360
Communist Party of China

473
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,360
good

474
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,800
That's a great name.

475
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,880
In ancient times,

476
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
Gonggong's rage collapsed the Mt. Bu Zhou.

477
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
Sky falling down and the ground tearing apart.

478
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,920
As the sky twisted and tilted,

479
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the sun, moon and stars all changed their places.

480
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,920
The ground could no longer cover what's beneath the soil.

481
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,960
This is an ancient Chinese myth.

482
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,640
There are also many heroes in western mythology.

483
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
We will be the Prometheus in China.

484
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,200
Dare to steal fire without fear of punishment.

485
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
Hold that fire to light up the future for our nation.

486
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,360
We also need to prepare ourselves

487
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,080
for we are determined to crash this old society completely

488
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,960
even if we need to scarifice our lives like what Gonggong did.

489
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,120
Sir.

490
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
I'm going back to Hunan in a few days. 

491
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
As for what I should do after I go back,

492
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
I want to hear your opinion.

493
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,600
Runzhi

494
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,800
You know I've always had high hopes for you.

495
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,240
This time,

496
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
please actively promote Marxism,

497
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
mobilize the people,

498
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
prepare for the establishment of the Party organization in Hunan.

499
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
I'll take your advice, Sir

500
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
I will keep contacting you,

501
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,000
writing you letters.

502
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,920
I will write to you, too.

503
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,800
Many years later

504
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
Mao Zedong recalled.

505
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
"It is probably for the conversation with Chen Duxiu as he firmly stated his belief

506
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
at a very critical period

507
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,440
in my life,

508
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
that has left a deep impression on me."

509
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,760
He also said

510
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,840
"There was this magazine called New Youth.

511
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
It was edited by Chen Duxiu.

512
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
Those people who were waken up by this magazine

513
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,680
and the May Fourth Movement.

514
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,040
Later, some joined the Communist Party.

515
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
These people were affected by Chen Duxiu

516
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,920
and the group of people around him. 

517
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,920
It's fair to say that Chen Duxiu was the one gathered all those people,

518
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,640
which eventually leaded to the establishment of the party."

519
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,920
Comrades, today's meeting

520
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
It was proposed by Comrade En Lai.

521
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,160
Their ideas of joint-work and transformation 

522
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
about pioneer organizations are worth to listen to.

523
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,000
So I propose comrades from Tianjin Awaken Club

524
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,760
shuold take the role as the host 

525
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
and to give general report at today's meeting.

526
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,040
Is that okay?

527
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,280
Yes, comrade, please.

528
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
Since Mr. Li Dazhao named me,

529
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,480
I will take the job with gratitude.

530
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,440
I think

531
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,560
for us youth gather under the red banner of reformation

532
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
we must come together for all the people,

533
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,080
create a union that breaks all boundaries

534
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,680
and based on the spirit of love and mutual assistance.

535
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,120
In this alliance

536
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,320
the life of each and everyone

537
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,480
must be free and equal,

538
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
Industrious and happy.

539
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,960
To realize such a harmonious world,

540
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
to bring the life of great unity of mankind,

541
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
we must start with free the people.

542
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
The foundation will be different groups 

543
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
based on people's occupation.

544
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
We have to merge ourselves

545
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,040
with the common people.

546
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
We have to make our voices heard to all walks of life,

547
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
so that what we want can come true.

548
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,960
Mr. Shouchang.

549
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,880
Please share your thoughts with us.

550
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,640
Comrades, just now, Comrade Enlai gave us a speech.

551
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,520
Everyone heard it.

552
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
Wonderful.

553
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,040
Now all walks of life in the country

554
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,400
especially the workers' movement has already started.

555
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,080
Indeed it's time that all our pioneer organizations

556
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,520
need to work together and to change and improve

557
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,920
to strengthen oursleves.

558
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,840
But all that has a common premise.

559
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,280
About which,

560
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,520
everyone needs to have a correct understanding. 

561
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,280
I think it is vital for all organizations

562
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,800
to clearly indicate their program and guideline.

563
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,320
Unidentified doctrine

564
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,800
means no scientific guiding ideology.

565
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,960
Internally, it is not enough to unify our members.

566
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,440
Externally, it is not enough to unite with other people's actions.

567
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Comrades, the time has come now,

568
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
our organization must raise our own banner

569
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,480
showing it to this nation.

570
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,720
Comrades

571
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,120
Before the official establishment of the party organization,

572
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,280
I want to read this out first.

573
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
I drafted a provisional program of the party.

574
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,360
Main contents can be divided into party principles

575
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,280
and the purpose of the party.

576
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,560
There are three principles of the Communist Party.

577
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,440
First, Confiscate all capital.

578
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,800
Confiscation of bank, mines.

579
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
Abolish individual oppression. 

580
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,960
The scoiety shares the economical benefits. 

581
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Second, leading the working class to power

582
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,120
Down with reactionary forces

583
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,280
Transition to the elimination of political power

584
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,200
Third, eliminate existences of classes. 

585
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,080
There are also three purposes of the Communist Party.

586
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,680
First, to carry out class struggle.

587
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,120
Unite workers.

588
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,120
Eventually move from economic struggle to political struggle.

589
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,640
Seize political power.

590
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
Second, 

591
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,280
carry out class struggle.

592
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,120
Build a communist society

593
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
based on mass production. 

594
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
If noone is against what I said,

595
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,360
please approve by applause.

596
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Comrades

597
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
According to the Communist Party of China（CPC）'s organizational principles 

598
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,680
We elect Comrade Chen Duxiu

599
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,560
to be Secretary of the Executive Board of the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

600
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,600
goodGood.

601
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,040
Comrades

602
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,560
From now on,

603
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,840
we are the first members

604
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,040
of the Communist Party.

605
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,680
As of today, the Chinese working class

606
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
has its own vanguard party.

607
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,880
It's name is the Communist Party of China.

608
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,640
Now, we take the oath.

609
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:14,160
[August 1920, the first branch of the Communist Party of China was established in Shanghai]

610
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,040
Chen Duxiu

611
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,160
Li Hanjun

612
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,120
Yu Xiusong

613
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,080
Shi Cuntong

614
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,200
Chen Gongpei

615
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,760
It is my will to join the Communist Party of China,

616
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,200
and fight for communism throughout my life.

617
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,834
Long live the Communist Party of China!

618
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,107
Long live the Communist Party of China!

619
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:34,722
Long live the Communist Party of China!

620
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Today, the Beijing branch of the Communist Party of China

621
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,760
is established.

622
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,120
The three of us

623
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
are fortunate to be the first party members of the branch.

624
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,280
Next, we take the oath.

625
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,360
Li Dazhao

626
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,480
Zhang Shenfu

627
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,680
Zhang Guotai

628
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,200
It is my will to join the Communist Party of China,

629
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,920
and fight for communism throughout my life.

630
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,800
Comrades, let's cheer.

631
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,402
Long live the Communist Party of China!

632
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,516
Long live the Communist Party of China!

633
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:28,957
Long live the Communist Party of China!

634
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:32,466
Long live the Communist Party of China!

635
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,440
November 1920

636
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,600
The Hunan self-governmence movement

637
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
with peaceful petition as it's main method

638
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,880
leaded by Mao Zedong

639
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,080
failed.

640
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
Disappointed by which,

641
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,920
he went to Pingxiang, Jiangxi

642
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,160
to investigate about the underclass,

643
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,040
especially the Anyuan coal miners' living conditions

644
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,320
and political demands.

645
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,200
The facts and lessons learnt through it

646
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
made him completely giveing up on

647
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,000
the last piece of fantasy he had towards the road of reformism.

648
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,240
Without hesitation,

649
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,360
he embarked on the revolutionary road of thoroughly transforming society

650
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,520
and became a staunch Marxist.

651
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,280
Runzhi

652
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,120
Runzhi

653
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,800
You're back.

654
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,000
What did you get from your trip to Pingxiang?

655
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,120
It's a hard journey, it changed me.

656
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
Feels like a phoenix,

657
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
rebirth from the fire.

658
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,040
Well

659
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,640
That sounds serious.

660
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,160
No wonder we were called here early in the morning.

661
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,200
What's the matter?

662
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
There is a fire in my heart.

663
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,840
I want to talk to you two about it.

664
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,280
What is this fire.

665
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,640
Just tell us.

666
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,080
This time I went to Pingxiang,

667
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,680
mainly to learn more about the situations there

668
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,720
in rural areas and in mines.

669
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,320
China now

670
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,080
the whole thing is like a big stove. 

671
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,080
The common people are in dire straits and suffering greatly.

672
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,960
It's like they are pushed towards death every second.

673
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,880
Tell us what you saw.

674
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,920
Take Anyuan Coal Mine for example.

675
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,920
There are many coal diggers there.

676
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
They all have to work under the whip of the supervisor.

677
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,200
The working conditions are extremely bad.

678
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Everyday, they have to work twelve to sixteen hours.

679
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,320
They created so much wealth,

680
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,640
yet their wages are pitiful.

681
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,600
The miners have to live in shacks.

682
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,320
It's freezing cold in winter.

683
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
The situation in the countryside

684
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,320
is even worse.

685
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,080
Beggars, refugees,

686
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,480
children and female being sold everywhere.

687
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,640
This country is rotten to the core.

688
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,520
What do you think?

689
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,520
I have figured it out.

690
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,360
Just like what Chen Duxiu

691
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
and Mr. Li Dazhao said,

692
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,560
we are going to take the road Russian did,

693
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,280
to thoroughly transform the whole society

694
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,680
so this country can be saved.

695
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,240
If we want to save China,

696
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,080
there's only one way.

697
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,120
Revolution.

698
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,960
The world is our world

699
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,320
The country, our country 

700
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,200
Society, our society

701
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,760
If we don't speak up, who will?

702
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,480
If we don't take actions, who will?

703
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,760
Comrades

704
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,560
Today is a particularly memorable day.

705
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,440
The Changsha group of the Communist Party of China（CPC）is formally established.

706
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,680
Comrade Chen Duxiu, secretary of the Communist Party of China（CPC）

707
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,040
needs to go to Guangdong

708
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,640
to take office as chairman of the Education Committee.

709
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,600
So he can't attend

710
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,440
the founding ceremony of Changsha Group.

711
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,960
He entrusted me to host it.

712
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,560
In view of the current situation,

713
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,080
this matter can't be made public yet 

714
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,800
We should carry out activities in secret.

715
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,760
As for now,

716
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,840
our main tasks are as follows.

717
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,320
The first is to transform Xinmin Academic Group. 

718
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,080
Make it a party organization.

719
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,840
The second is to establish Hunan Socialist Youth League.

720
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,880
Now

721
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,440
Let's raise our fists. 

722
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,960
Let's say it gently but firmly,

723
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,000
Long live the Communist Party of China.

724
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:27,520
Long live the Communist Party of China.

725
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Mr. Songnian

726
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
This is my notes on studying Mraxist works

727
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,680
and some thoughts

728
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,800
after I came to Europe.

729
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
I am willing to accept the organization's inspection.

730
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,720
Come and sit down, comrade Enlai.

731
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
I know about your situation in the past.

732
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,840
I want to know about

733
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,760
changes in your mind since you came to Europe.

734
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
I arrived in Europe at the end of last year.

735
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,360
I lived in England for more than a month,

736
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
spent that time inspecting the workers' movement in Britain.

737
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,600
Through this investigation and research

738
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
it helped with mine understanding of several popular doctrines in Europe.

739
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,840
I made my own deduction and comparison,

740
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,960
reached my final determination.

741
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,600
British Fabian socialism is mere fantasy.

742
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,160
Russia's October Revolution is the correvt road.

743
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,680
How many Marx's books have you read

744
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,440
after you came to Europe?

745
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,600
When I was studying in Japan 

746
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,280
I have been exposed to Marxism.

747
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,400
Back in China,

748
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,080
I have read some books on Marxism

749
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,240
borrowed from Mr. Li Dazhao.

750
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,760
After coming to Europe.

751
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,600
I read systematically again on

752
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,800
Manifesto of the Communist Party,

753
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
Socialism from Utopia to Science,

754
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
State and Revolution 

755
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
and other classic works of Marxism.

756
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
I have written everything I learnt in this notebook.

757
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,240
Now I'm sure

758
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,800
I have established the belief of communism.

759
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,520
So I asked to join the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

760
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,240
Comrade Enlai

761
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,800
I can see how you have come a long way.

762
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,240
Before I came to Europe,

763
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
Comrade Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao

764
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,360
entrusted Zhao Shiyan and me

765
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,960
to be responsible for the formation of the Communist Party of China（CPC）

766
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,480
Communist group in France.

767
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,880
And give us the power to develop Party members.

768
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,920
Me and Qingyang,

769
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
we are very willing to be your sponsor.

770
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,560
Shiyan and I have sent a letter to Mr. Zhongfu

771
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,240
about the specific situation.

772
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,480
Now it's only his reply we needed.

773
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,360
Yes.

774
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,680
At the moment,

775
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Work-study program is at it's most difficult time. 

776
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,760
There is huge gaps formed among the students.

777
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,880
We should take the chance, do more work,

778
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,240
and unite more comrades

779
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,680
to join us.

780
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,200
Enlai

781
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
About Chen Yannian and Chen Qiaonian,

782
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,240
how's everything going?

783
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
I discussed it with Shiyan.

784
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
We will go and talk to them together.

785
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,400
Mr. Song Nian, Enlai.

786
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,560
Mr. Zhongfu agreed to our party building plan.

787
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,800
The France branch of the Communist Party of China has us five members.

788
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,280
Zhang Shenfu, Zhao Shiyan, Chen Gongpei,

789
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,280
Liu Qingyang and Zhou Enlai.

790
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,360
He asked us to actively develop more members.

791
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,440
That's great, that's great.

792
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,400
Now I declare

793
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,520
the France branch of the Communist Party of China is formally established. 

794
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:29,520
Long live the Communist Party of China

795
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,320
Since the second half of 1920

796
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,640
Besides Shanghai and Beijing

797
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,800
Dong Biwu, Chen Tanqiu, Bao Huiseng and others in Wuhan.

798
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,240
Wang Jinmei, Deng Engming and others in Jinan.

799
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,920
Tan Pingshan, Chen Gongbo and others in Guangzhou.

800
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,360
Mao Zedong, He Shuheng and others in Changsha.

801
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,560
Shi Cuntong, Zhou Fohai and others in Japan.

802
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,160
Zhang Shenfu, Zhou Enlai, Zhao Shiyan, Chen Gongpei and others in France.

803
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,080
All established Communist Party groups successively.

804
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm making an announcement.

805
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
"New Youth", from the eighth issue,

806
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,920
it will change to

807
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,600
an official publication of The Communist Party of China.

808
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,160
It will no longer adopt the rotating-editor system

809
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,440
by colleagues in Shanghai and Beijing.

810
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880
Instead, me and Chen Wangdao,

811
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,480
with Lida, Li Hanjun

812
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Shen Yanbing will be in charge of editing.

813
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,800
Second, "New Youth" will add two new columns

814
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
focusing on Marxist studies

815
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,880
and researches in Russia.

816
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,720
At the same time it will continue to take

817
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,800
the important task of propagating new ideas and new cultures.

818
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,960
Third, from this issue

819
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,760
the new youth club organized by colleagues in editoral department

820
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,160
will be directly in charge of the department

821
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
and everything about printing and distribution. 

822
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,640
The New Youth officially stops cooperating with Qunyi Publication.

823
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,440
At No.279 Fada Road, French Concession, Shanghai

824
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,720
a general distribution office will be set up.

825
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
Along with 94 representative offices

826
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
set up in 43 regions of the country.

827
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,680
good

828
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,400
Great

829
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,200
good

830
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,880
This is the cover of the new design of New Youth.

831
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
Please share your opinions.

832
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,520
Two big hands clasped tightly on the earth.

833
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,600
What does this picture mean?

834
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,080
I guess it indicates the tight unity and relationship

835
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,960
between China and Russia

836
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,240
after the October Revolution.

837
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,600
The Chinese and Russian parties shake hands cordially with each other,

838
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,960
instead hug.

839
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,960
In that way,

840
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,640
this picture is very meaningful.

841
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,080
Good!

842
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,760
Comrades, the situation is evloving rapidly now.

843
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,080
Study and publicize Marxism,

844
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,200
as for now,

845
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
it's the trend starting a prairie fire in China's ideological circle.

846
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,960
Irresistible and unstoppable.

847
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,400
But at the same time

848
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,680
the groups of the new culture movement is also undergoing fission.

849
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,960
What happened?

850
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
There is a big debate going on now.

851
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,280
Should China take the socialist road

852
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,880
or the capitalist road?

853
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,280
Shall we choose implementation of social revolution

854
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
Or social improvement?

855
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,960
There is also another big debate 

856
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,000
between Marxism and anarchism.

857
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,320
Comrades, the two debates

858
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,120
are gonna deeply influence the future of the Chinese revolution.

859
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
So I hope

860
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,760
us from Peking University Research Institute of Marxist Theory

861
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,200
and comrades

862
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,520
from Beijing branch of the Communist Party of China,

863
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,160
actively taking parts in the debates.

864
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,280
We need clearly shows our attitudes.

865
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,880
New youth

866
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,880
and the upcoming Communist Party magazine

867
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
will be our battlefield.

868
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,000
Yes.
