00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
we might can take this chance and finally put an end to Zhang's cruelty.

188
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
But after we get rid of Zhang Jingyao,

189
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
how we should do with the autonomy in Hunan？

190
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
I have no clue about it.

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,720
Here is my view.

192
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
As long as we have the so-called supervisor general system,

193
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
this world will be still under control of those ones who only know how to shoot guns.

194
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,000
We call it democratic republic,

195
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,880
whilst in fact it is warlords taking turns showing their power,

196
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
stealing from the people and betraying this country.

197
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,960
You want to talk petitions, improve people's livelihood

198
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
and a better system with them?

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,920
You might well ask a tiger for its skin.

200
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
Sir, you are absolutely right.

201
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,560
This country is sick in her bones.

202
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
I don't know which medicine is the right one,

203
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
but even with the slightest hope, I will try them all.

204
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,040
Though the efforts needed is tremendous.

205
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
I have always thought it's okay if we do it slowly,

206
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
with enlightenment education, awakening Chinese people gradually.

207
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Step by step.

208
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
But now there is no time.

209
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Inside we have warlords, outside we have foreign enemies.

210
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,840
If we do it slowly,

211
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
China will be split apart before we realize it,

212
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
we will always be under their fingers.

213
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
The core to save our nation,

214
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,440
I think it is to take action immediately.

215
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,440
Sir.

216
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
Then, in your opinion,

217
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,680
what kind of ideology is the guideline to save the nation?

218
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
Marx and Lenin showed us the way.

219
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,960
Take a look.

220
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,080
Chen Wangdao finished this just now.

221
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,280
The translated full version

222
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
of the "Communist Manifesto".

223
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
This is the guideline of salvation.

224
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm doing the proofreading so it can be published as soon as possible.

225
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,840
A fully translated "Communist Manifesto"?

226
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,480
What I read in Beijing before were all only paragraphs.

227
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
I've never read the full thing.

228
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,040
Sir.

229
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Can I read it first?

230
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Of course, not only that,

231
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,800
Runzhi,

232
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I wish you could join me.

233
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I wish you could also be a believer in the Communist Party.

234
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
I think I will.

235
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,800
Before I only read some paragraphs,

236
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
but those alone

237
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
has made my heart pounding so hard.

238
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,440
Good.

239
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
Here, Runzhi.

240
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,080
Don't go anywhere today.

241
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Stay here.

242
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
You can finish reading it in one go!

243
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
Yes, please.

244
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Members of our Marxist Research Society

245
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
are from three organizations.

246
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
"New Youth" magazine,

247
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
the "Weekly Review" magazine,

248
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,720
and the "Current Affairs News".

249
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,520
Today, we are have a seminar.

250
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,880
Everyone knows,

251
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
not long ago,

252
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,960
Voitinsky from Communist International came to China.

253
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
I have met him.

254
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:00,243
[Shi Cuntong]

255
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
Voitinsky stayed in China for more than a month.

256
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
In Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jinan and other places,

257
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:03,880
[Yu Xiusong]

258
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
he has met many people,

259
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,520
also learned a lot about the current situation.

260
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,360
Comrade Zhao Shiyan will share with us about

261
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,600
Comrade Voitinsky's thoughts and ideas.

262
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,560
Please feel free to change your ideas.

263
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,240
About the Chinese ideology research and political circle

264
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,080
if anyone is keen to discuss,

265
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,280
discussion is always welcomed.

266
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
Here are some Comrade Voitinsky's opinions.

267
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
The tide of new culture movement in China is surging unstoppably,

268
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
but first, the contents are too complicated.

269
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,880
There is anarchism,

270
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,920
unionism,

271
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,280
socialism,

272
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
guild socialism.

273
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
All kinds of theories going around without one dominant.

274
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
This kind of chaotic situation

275
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
is not helping us to reach a common idea.

276
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,840
Second, there is no organization.

277
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
We have too many people with too many empty talk.

278
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
What about the actual action though?

279
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,200
This is in no way beneficial in starting a revolution in this country.

280
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,560
So he believes that

281
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,880
the most urgent task

282
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,080
for the Chinese ideology research and political circle

283
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,840
is to build as soon as possible,

284
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,600
one firm and strong

285
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
Marxist political party.

286
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't agree with Voitinsky.

287
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
He doesn't know China at all.

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There are too many political parties and factions in China now.

289
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
There is no point forming a small party now at all.

290
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
It's not going to work.

291
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,640
I think

292
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Comrade Voitinsky's opinion makes sense.

293
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,640
Without the strong leadership of a proletarian party

294
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
China can't form a united force now.

295
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,640
I have always thought that

296
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
China's top priority is to develop industry.

297
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
We must first utilise capitalism,

298
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
then we will work to achieve socialism.

299
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,400
Following the path and direction of Russia right now

300
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,160
will be unrealistic.

301
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Comrades.

302
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I think it is urgent for China to build a political party.

303
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,796
Agreed.

304
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,525
I agree.

305
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:42,159
Agreed.

306
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,446
I agree.

307
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:44,510
Agreed.

308
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:45,005
Agreed.

309
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,453
Agreed.

310
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,600
Watch it!

311
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,760
Runzhi.

313
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,040
I have successfully completed the task you gave me.

314
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,480
Shanghai celebrities from all walks of life

315
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
are all very supportive of work-studying in France.

316
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
They also cares a lot about Hunan's reform movement.

317
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,280
Everyone took part in donation.

318
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
20,000 silver dollars was quickly raised.

319
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,720
How about that.

320
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,800
You didn't come all the way here for nothing.

321
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,920
Twenty thousand silver dollar.

322
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,960
So many.

323
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,200
Mr. Zhang, thank you very much.

324
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,880
The money came just in time.

325
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
When the revolution is successful, we will pay it back.

326
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,214
Revolution?

327
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:47,159
Revolution, huh?

328
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
What kind of revolution are you talking about?

329
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,880
Socialist revolution, of course.

330
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
Can it be done in China?

331
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,720
It's too difficult.

332
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,440
Nevertheless, we must overcome many difficulties.

333
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,240
Risks and dangers right ahead waiting,

334
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,611
I still take this path.

335
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,400
Well said. Can I live to see it?

336
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,120
You will see it. Trust me.

337
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,080
We revolutionaries,

338
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
keep our word and our deeds.

339
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,840
I, Mao Zedong, honor my word.

340
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,200
Fine, I will be waiting for you to pay back the money.

341
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:36,188
[Zhang Shizhao, famous activist, educator, political scientist. Died in Hong Kong in 1973, aged 92.]

342
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,200
Mrs. Chen, that's enough. There's too much to take.

343
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,840
Nonsense, it's a long way to France.

344
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
You can have it all on the way.

345
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,040
Those are all specialties.

346
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,520
You won't be able to find them when you are in France.

347
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
Exactly, it's too far away.

348
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,400
And it's hot.

349
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm afraid these will go bad.

350
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,120
Shiyan.

351
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
You are going to France now.

352
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
In addition to work-study programs

353
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
there is another important task for you.

354
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,920
That is to actively promote and learn more about Marxism

355
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,280
among those other students in France.

356
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,600
Prepare for the establishment of our organization.

357
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,400
I will write to you often too.

358
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,960
Besides, please.

359
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,960
Visit Yannian and Qiaonian more.

360
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,720
The situation of work-study program in France is very complicated.

361
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
Yannian can get stubborn sometimes.

362
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
I worry about him.

363
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
These are some Chinese materials.

364
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,840
I prepared for them.

365
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,960
You take it with you.

366
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,400
You tell them,

367
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,720
I won't be able to die in peace

368
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,760
if they dont believe in Marxism.

369
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Leave it to me.

370
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,160
Don't worry.

371
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,000
I've sealed it tight for you.

372
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,040
It will be fine.

373
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,840
Haiwei.

374
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,520
Mrs. Chen.

375
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,680
Now you are all leaving,

376
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,520
I don't know when I will see you again.

377
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
Bai Lan, we'll entrust her to you.

378
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,920
Be sure to take care of her.

379
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
Mrs. Chen, rest assured.

380
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,880
When we are in France,

381
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,400
I will do my best.

382
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,320
Sister Bai Lan.

383
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
Brother Yannian gave it to me.

384
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,360
Take it with you, it can keep you company on the way.

385
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Zimei, I won't take Yingying with me this time.

386
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,240
That's because

387
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,360
I'm going on a long journey,

388
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,640
and it's by boat.

389
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm afraid Yingying won't like it.

390
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,120
Okay, but Sister Bai Lan

391
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
you need to tell

392
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Brother Yannian and Qiaonian that

393
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,040
Mom, Dad, little brother and I

394
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
we miss them very much.

395
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
Okay, I will.

396
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
All done, time to go.

397
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
It's getting late. Don't miss the boat.

398
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
Put it back and feed it some water.

399
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,600
Grab your stuff.

400
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,360
Let's go.

401
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,560
Shouchang, party building work is under way.

402
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,680
The Communist International urges the East Asia Secretariat

403
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
to hurry on the process of setting up the organization in China.

404
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,360
Comrade Lenin,

405
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
Comrade Trotsky,

406
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,480
and Comrade Stalin

407
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,040
are very concerned about China's situation.

408
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,560
We plan to set up the Party's initiating branch in advance in August

409
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
so as to set an example for future branches.

410
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,080
Currently I'm working on draw up a draft

411
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
of the Party's temporary program.

412
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,760
I share it with you now so we can have some discussion and modification.

413
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,960
As for the name of this Party,

414
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
it is still uncertain.

415
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,358
Some people want to call it the Socialist Party.

416
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,049
Some the Social Communist Party.

417
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:50,198
Also some the Social Democratic Party.

418
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
Many options.

419
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
How should we call the Party?

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
I'd like to hear your opinion.

421
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,920
Brother Zhongfu, I have received your letter.

422
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,080
We here in Beijing

423
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
are working nonstoppedly as I'm writing this letter right now.

424
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,320
We plan to hold work with the Chinese Youth Society,

425
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,800
the Twilight Group, the Humanity Club, the Youth Mutual Aid Group

426
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,120
the Tianjin Awakening Society, and others

427
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,560
to hold a symposium together in the near future

428
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,560
where commonly-concerned issues will be discussed.

429
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,960
We are eager to see the establishment of the Party's initiating branch

430
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,080
taking place in Shanghai as soon as possible.

431
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,840
So that it can be an example for all of us.

432
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
As for the name of the Party,

433
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
I firmly believe that

434
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,040
it should be the Communist Party of China.

435
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,640
Come. Come.

436
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,600
Come, Runzhi.

437
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.

438
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,800
Come here.

439
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,080
Come and sit.

440
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,880
Thank you, sir

441
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,040
You been busy recently?

442
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
Haven't seen you in a long timw.

443
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,600
Me and some classmates from Hunan First Normal University

444
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,600
rented places in Minxiang South.

445
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,600
We are having a trial run with work-study life.

446
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,480
It's been a month so far.

447
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,520
It's really hard.

448
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,040
Work-study is not easy.

449
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
Chen Yannian did experiments for two months.

450
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,400
Failed.

451
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,360
Then I heard that

452
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
Wang Guangqi had a large-scale one,

453
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
also failed.

454
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,040
What about you?

455
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
We are engaged in a small experiment of several people.

456
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,560
You probably have guessed the result.

457
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,600
You failed too.

458
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,680
Yes.

459
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,360
But sir

460
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,120
I've made my decision now.

461
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
I will stop going to school from now on.

462
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,680
I want to focus on independent research.

463
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,560
Good.

464
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,360
Sir.

465
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,640
The "Communist Manifesto",

466
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I carefully read it over and over again.

467
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
I can confirm now that

468
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,120
I believe in Marxism.

469
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280
For sure?

470
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,280
Sir.

471
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
Once my faith is established,

472
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,120
it will not waver.

473
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
I will fight to the end to achieve communism.

474
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,600
Good.

475
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,960
Runzhi.

476
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
That's the kind of decision you need.

477
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,720
I'm very happy to hear that

478
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,240
you want to join us.

479
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,640
From this moment we are comrades.

480
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,240
Sir

481
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,040
What is the name of our Party?

482
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,360
The Communist Party of China.

483
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,360
good.

484
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,800
That's a great name.

485
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,880
In ancient times,

486
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
Gonggong's rage collapsed the Mount Bu Zhou.

487
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
The sky falling down and the ground tearing apart.

488
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,920
As the sky twisted and tilted,

489
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the sun, moon and stars all changed their places.

490
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,920
The ground could no longer cover what's beneath the soil.

491
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,960
This is an ancient Chinese myth.

492
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,640
There are also many heroes in western mythology.

493
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
We will be the Prometheus of China.

494
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,200
Daring to steal fire without fear of punishment.

495
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
To hold that fire to light up the future for our nation.

496
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,360
We also need to prepare ourselves

497
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,080
for we are determined to crash this old society completely

498
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,960
even if we need to sacrifice our lives like Gonggong did.

499
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,120
Sir.

500
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
I'm going back to Hunan in a few days.

501
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
As for what I should do after I go back,

502
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
I want to hear your opinion.

503
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,600
Runzhi.

504
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,800
You know I've always had high hopes for you.

505
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,240
This time,

506
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
please actively promote Marxism,

507
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
mobilize the people,

508
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
prepare for the establishment of the Party branch in Hunan.

509
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
I'll take your advice, Sir

510
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
I will keep contacting you,

511
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,000
writing you letters.

512
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,920
I will write to you, too.

513
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,800
Many years later

514
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
Mao Zedong recalled.

515
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
"It is probably for the conversation with Chen Duxiu as he firmly stated his belief

516
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
at a very critical period

517
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,440
in my life,

518
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
that has left a deep impression on me."

519
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,760
He also said

520
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,840
"There was this magazine called 'New Youth'.

521
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
It was edited by Chen Duxiu.

522
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
Those people who were waken up by this magazine

523
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,680
and the May Fourth Movement.

524
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,040
Later, some joined the Communist Party.

525
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
These people were affected by Chen Duxiu

526
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,920
and the group of people around him.

527
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,920
It's fair to say that Chen Duxiu was the one gathered all those people,

528
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,640
which eventually leaded to the establishment of the party."

529
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,920
Comrades, today's meeting

530
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
was proposed by Comrade Enlai.

531
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,160
Their ideas of joint-work and transformation

532
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
about pioneer organizations are worth to listen to.

533
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,000
So I propose comrades from Tianjin Awakening Society

534
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,760
shuold take the role as the host

535
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
and to give general report at today's meeting.

536
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,040
Is that okay?

537
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,280
Yes, comrade, please.

538
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:14,360
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiangyu]

539
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
Since Mr. Li Dazhao named me,

540
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,480
I will take the job with gratitude.

541
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,440
I think

542
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,560
for us youth to gather under the red banner of reform,

543
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
we must come together for all the people

544
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,080
and create a union that breaks all boundaries,

545
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,800
based on the spirit of love

546
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,680
and mutual assistance.

547
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,120
In this alliance,

548
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,320
the lives of each and everyone

549
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,480
must be free, equal,

550
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
industrious and happy.

551
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,960
To realize such a harmonious world,

552
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
to bring the life of great unity of mankind,

553
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
we must start with freeing the people.

554
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
The foundation will be different groups

555
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
based on people's occupation.

556
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
We have to merge ourselves

557
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,040
with the common people.

558
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
We have to make our voices heard to all walks of life,

559
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
so that what we want can come true.

560
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,960
Mr. Shouchang.

561
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,880
Please share your thoughts with us.

562
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,640
Comrades, just now, Comrade Enlai gave us a speech.

563
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,520
Everyone has heard it.

564
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
Wonderful.

565
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,040
Now all walks of life in the country

566
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,400
especially the workers' movement has already started.

567
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,080
Indeed it's time that all our pioneer organizations

568
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,520
need to work together and to change and improve

569
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,920
to strengthen oursleves.

570
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,840
But all that has a common premise.

571
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,280
About which,

572
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,520
everyone needs to have a correct understanding.

573
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,280
I think it is vital for all organizations

574
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,800
to clearly indicate their program and guideline.

575
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,320
Unidentified doctrine

576
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,800
means no scientific guiding ideology.

577
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,960
Internally, it is not enough to unify our members.

578
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,440
Externally, it is not enough to unite with other people's actions.

579
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Comrades, the time has come now,

580
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
our organization must raise our own banner

581
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,480
and show it to the nation.

582
00:27:01,842 --> 00:27:05,162
[2 Old Yuyangli, Shanghai French Concession]

583
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,720
Comrades,

584
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,120
before the official establishment of the Party branch,

585
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,280
I want to read this out first.

586
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
I drafted a provisional program of the party.

587
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,360
Main contents can be divided into party principles

588
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,280
and the purpose of the party.

589
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,560
There are three principles of the Communist Party.

590
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,440
First, confiscation of all capital,

591
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,800
confiscation of bank, mines,

592
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
abolition of individual oppression,

593
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,960
society must share economic benefits.

594
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Second, lead the working class to power

595
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,120
to bring down reactionary forces

596
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,280
and transition to the elimination of political power.

597
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,200
Third, eliminate the existence of classes.

598
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,080
There are also three purposes of the Communist Party.

599
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,680
First, to carry out class struggle

600
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,120
and unite workers,

601
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,120
eventually moving from economic struggle to political struggle

602
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,640
in order to seize political power.

603
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
Second, after seizing power,

604
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,280
carry out class struggle.

605
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,120
Third, build a communist society

606
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
based on mass production.

607
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
If no one is against what I said,

608
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,360
please approve by applause.

609
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Comrades.

610
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
According to the Communist Party of China's organizational principles,

611
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,680
we elect Comrade Chen Duxiu

612
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,560
to be Secretary of the Executive Board of the Communist Party of China.

613
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,600
Hurrah!

614
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,040

615
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,560
From now on,

616
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,840
we are the first members

617
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,040
of the Communist Party.

618
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,680
As of today, the Chinese working class

619
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
has its own vanguard party.

620
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,880
Its name is the Communist Party of China.

621
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,640
Now, we take the oath.

622
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:14,160
[August 1920, the first branch of the Communist Party of China was established in Shanghai.]

634
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,760
is established.

The three of us

636
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
are fortunate to be the first Party members of the branch.

637
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,280
Next, we take the oath.

especially the Anyuan coal miners' living conditions

657
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,320
and political demands.

The facts and lessons learnt

659
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
made him completely give up on

660
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,000
the last piece of fantasy he had of the road of reformism.

661
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,240
Without hesitation,

662
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,360
he embarked on the revolutionary road of thoroughly transforming society

663
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,520
and became a staunch Marxist.

There are many coal diggers there.

Comrade Chen Duxiu, Secretary of the Communist Party of China,

724
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,040
needs to go to Guangdong

725
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,640
to take office as Chairman of the Education Committee.

726
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,600
So he can't attend

727
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,440
the founding ceremony of the Changsha branch.

728
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,960
He entrusted me to host it.

729

In view of the current situation,

730
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,080
this matter can't be made public yet.

731
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,800
We should carry out activities in secret.

As for now,

733
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,840
our main tasks are as follows.

734
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,320
The first is to transform Xinmin Academic Society

735
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,080
into a Party organization.

736
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,840
The second is to establish the Hunan Socialist Youth League.

Let's raise our fists.

739
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,960
Let's say it gently but firmly:

740
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,798
Long live the Communist Party of China.

741
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:19,595
Long live the Communist Party of China.

742
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:23,280
Long live the Communist Party of China.

743
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:27,592
Long live the Communist Party of China.

744
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:39,624
[Paris, France]

745
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Mr. Songnian.

746
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
This is my notes on studying Marxist works

747
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,680
and some thoughts

748
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,800
after I came to Europe.

749
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
I am willing to accept the organization's inspection.

750
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,720
Come and sit down, Comrade Enlai.

751
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
I know about your situation in the past.

752
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,840
I want to know about

753
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,760
changes in your mind since you came to Europe.

754
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
I arrived in Europe at the end of last year.

755
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,360
I lived in England for more than a month,

756
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
spent that time inspecting the workers' movement in Britain.

757
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,600
Through this investigation and research

758
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
it helped with mine understanding of several popular doctrines in Europe.

759
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,840
I made my own deduction and comparison,

760
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,960
reached my final determination.

761
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,600
British Fabian socialism is mere fantasy.

762
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,160
Russia's October Revolution is the correct road.

763
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,680
How many of Marx's books have you read

764
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,440
after you came to Europe?

765
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,600
When I was studying in Japan,

766
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,280
I have been exposed to Marxism.

767
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,400
Back in China,

768
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,080
I have read some books on Marxism

769
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,240
borrowed from Mr. Li Dazhao.

770
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,760
After coming to Europe,

771
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,600
I read systematically again on

772
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,800
the "Communist Manifesto"

773
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
"Socialism from Utopia to Science",

774
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
"State and Revolution",

775
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
and other classic works of Marxism.

776
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
I have written everything I learnt in this notebook.

777
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,240
Now I'm sure

778
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,800
I have established the belief of communism.

779
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,520
So I ask to join the Communist Party of China.

780
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,240
Comrade Enlai.

781
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,800
I can see how you have come a long way.

782
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,240
Before I came to Europe,

783
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
Comrade Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao

784
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,360
entrusted Zhao Shiyan and I

785
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,960
to be responsible for the formation of a Communist Party of China

786
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,480
branch in France

787
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,880
and give us the power to develop Party members.

788
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,920
I and Qingyang,

789
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
we are very willing to be your sponsor.

790
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,560
Shiyan and I have sent a letter to Mr. Zhongfu

791
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,240
about the specific situation.

792
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,480
Now it's only his reply we needed.

793
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,360
Yes.

794
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,680
At the moment,

795
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Work-study program is at it's most difficult time.

796
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,760
There are huge gaps formed among the students.

797
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,880
We should take the chance, do more work,

798
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,240
and unite more comrades

799
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,680
to join us.

800
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,200
Enlai.

801
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
About Chen Yannian and Chen Qiaonian,

802
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,240
how's everything going?

803
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
I discussed it with Shiyan.

804
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
We will go and talk to them together.

805
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,400
Mr. Songnian, Enlai.

806
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,560
Mr. Zhongfu agreed to our party building plan.

807
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,800
The French branch of the Communist Party of China has us five members.

808
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,280
Zhang Shenfu, Zhao Shiyan, Chen Gongpei,

809
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,280
Liu Qingyang, and Zhou Enlai.

810
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,360
He asked us to actively develop more members.

811
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,440
That's great, that's great.

812
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,400
Now I declare

813
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,520
the French branch of the Communist Party of China is formally established.

[Liu Qingyang]

815
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,625

Long live the Communist Party of China!

[2 Old Yuyangli, Shanghai French Concession]

831
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
"New Youth", from the eighth issue,

832
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,920
it will change to

833
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,600
an official publication of the Communist Party of China.

834
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,160
It will no longer adopt the rotating-editor system

by colleagues in Shanghai and Beijing.

836
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880

Second, "New Youth" will add

842
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,480
two new columns

843
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
focusing on Marxist studies

844

and research in Russia.

845

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,800
the important task of propagating new ideas and new cultures.

847
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,960

the New Youth Club organized by colleagues in editoral department

849
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,160
will be directly in charge of the department

850

and everything about printing and distribution.

851
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,640

a general distribution office will be set up.

854
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
Along with 94 representative offices

855
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
set up in 43 regions of the country.

856
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,680

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,400
Great!

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,880
This is the cover of the new design of "New Youth".

Please share your opinions.

Two big hands clasped tightly on the earth.

862
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,600
What does this picture mean?

863
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,080
I guess it indicates the tight unity and relationship

864
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,960
between China and Russia

865
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,240
after the October Revolution.

866
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,600
The Chinese and Russian parties shake hands cordially with each other,

867
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,960
instead of hugging.

868
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,960
In that way,

869
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,640
this picture is very meaningful.

870
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,080

[Beijing]

872
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,760
Comrades, the situation is evloving rapidly now.

873
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,080
Study and publicize Marxism,

874
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,200
as for now,

875
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
it's the trend starting a prairie fire in China's ideological circle.

876
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,960
Irresistible and unstoppable.

877
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,400
But at the same time

878
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,680
the groups of the New Culture Movement is also undergoing fission.

879
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,960
What happened?

880
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
There is a big debate going on now.

881
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,280
Should China take the socialist road

882
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,880
or the capitalist road?

883
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,280
Shall we choose implementation of social revolution

884
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
or reformism?

885
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,960
There is also another big debate

886
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,000
between Marxism and anarchism.

887
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,320
Comrades, the two debates

888
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,120
are gonna deeply influence the future of the Chinese revolution.

889
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
So I hope

890
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,760
We from the Peking University Marxist Theory Research Society

891
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,200
and comrades

892
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,520
from the Beijing branch of the Communist Party of China,

893
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,160
actively take parts in the debates.

894
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,280
We need clearly show our standpoint.

895
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,880
"New Youth"

896
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,880
and the upcoming "Communist Party" magazine

897
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
will be our battlefield.

898
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,000
Hurrah!
