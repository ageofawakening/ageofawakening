Peacefully petitioned seven or eight times.

189
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
It all failed.

190
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,320
Take advantage of warlord disputes at the moment

191
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
It is expected to end the war damage of Zhang Du.

192
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
But after driving Zhang Jingyao away,

193
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
How to take the road of Hunan autonomy?

194
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm very confused in my heart.

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,720
I tell you.

196
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
Supervision system is not removed.

197
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Or is it the world of military men?

198
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,000
The so-called democratic republic.

199
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,880
It is this kind of warlord who takes turns to sit in the village.

200
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
Remnant and traitorous people

201
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,960
You petition with them.

202
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
Talk about improvement and people's livelihood

203
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,920
Seven-step Poems and Tiger Seeking Skin

204
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
Sir, you are absolutely right.

205
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,560
State affairs can't afford to be crazy.

206
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
What is the medicine for saving the nation?

207
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
I want to try.

208
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,040
But Pifei thought about it.

209
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
I've always wanted to take care of myself.

210
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
Enlightenment awakens Chinese people. 

211
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Gradually improve.

212
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
But now there is no time.

213
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Warlords bully and oppress.

214
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,840
If the action is slow

215
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
China will carve up the bean department.

216
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
Always be a fish.

217
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
Essentials of saving the nation 

218
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,440
I think it is to arouse action immediately.

219
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,440
sir

220
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
Then, in your opinion

221
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,680
What kind of faith is the guide to saving the nation?

222
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
Zou Ma Si Lenin pointed the way.

223
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,960
you see

224
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,080
This is Chen Wangdao.

225
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,280
Just translated.

226
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
The Communist Manifesto in its entirety

227
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
This is a classic of salvation.

228
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm reviewing it for publication.

229
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,840
The Communist Manifesto has been fully translated.

230
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,480
What I read in Beijing before were all translated versions. 

231
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
No, all paragraph by paragraph.

232
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,040
sir

233
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Can you show me this first?

234
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Of course, not only can I show you

235
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,800
Runzhi

236
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I wish you could be like me.

237
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Be a believer in the Communist Party.

238
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
I think I will.

239
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,800
Although before

240
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
Look at just some excerpts.

241
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
But my heart has been boiling for a long time.

242
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,440
good

243
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
来润之

244
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,080
Don't go anywhere today. 

245
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Just a few with me.

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
I'll let you read it in one breath. 

247
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
Yes, please.

248
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Members of our Marxist Research Association

249
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
From three organizations.

250
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
New youth magazine

251
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
Weekly review magazine

252
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,720
And the current affairs news.

253
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,520
We'll have a discussion today.

254
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,880
Everyone knows

255
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
Some time ago

256
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,960
The Communist Vijinsky came to China.

257
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
We also met.

258
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
Vesky stayed in China for more than a month.

259
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
In Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jinan and other places

260
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
Contacted many people.

261
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,520
I also learned something.

262
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,360
Let's ask Comrade Zhao Shiyan to paraphrase it.

263
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,600
Some views of Comrade Veski 

264
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,560
Also hope

265
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,240
Everyone is interested in the Chinese ideological and political circles

266
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,080
Express some opinions

267
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,280
Welcome to discuss

268
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
Comrade Vesky believes that 

269
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
Although the tide of new ideas in China is surging

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
But the first is too complicated.

271
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,880
Anarchism

272
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,920
There is unionism

273
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,280
There is socialism.

274
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
There is Kilt socialism. 

275
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
There is no mainstream in all kinds of things. 

276
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
This will make our minds

277
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
Fall into a chaotic situation

278
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,840
Second, there is no organization.

279
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
People who talk empty talk abound.

280
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
What about the actual action?

281
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,200
This is not conducive to our country's revolution.

282
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,560
So he thinks

283
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,880
Chinese ideological and political circles

284
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,080
The most urgent task

285
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,840
Is to build one as soon as possible.

286
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,600
Firm and strong

287
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
Marxist political party

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't agree with Vykinsky.

289
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
He doesn't know China at all.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There are many political parties and factions in China now.

291
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
There is no need to form a small party at all.

292
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
It's not going to work.

293
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,640
I think

294
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Comrade Jingshi's opinion is right.

295
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,640
Without the leadership of a proletarian party

296
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
China is still fragmented after all.

297
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,640
I have always thought that

298
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
China's top priority is to develop industry.

299
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
We must first develop capitalism.

300
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
Then make socialism.

301
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,400
Now follow the path and direction of Russia.

302
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,160
That is unrealistic.

303
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Comrades

304
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I think it is urgent for China to build a party. 

305
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:46,320
support

306
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,600
Watch it.

307
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm sorry

308
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,760
Runzhi classmate

309
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,040
I have successfully completed the task you gave me.

310
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,480
Shanghai celebrities from all walks of life

311
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
I am very supportive of studying in France.

312
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
He also cares for Hunan's reform movement.

313
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,280
Everyone jumped to donate.

314
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
20,000 silver won was quickly raised.

315
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,720
how about

316
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,800
You didn't come all the way here, did you

317
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,920
Twenty thousand silver dollar

318
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,960
so much/many

319
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,200
Mr. Zhang, thank you very much.

320
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,880
The money came just in time. 

321
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
When the revolution is successful, we will pay it back. 

322
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,214
Revolution?

323
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:47,159
Revolution, huh?

324
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
What kind of revolution are you talking about? 

325
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,880
Socialist revolution, of course.

326
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
Can it be done in China?

327
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,720
It's too difficult.

328
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,440
Of course, we must overcome many difficulties.

329
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,240
Therefore, taking risks and risking ten swings+deciding.

330
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,611
I go on.

331
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,400
It's so daring. Can I see it?

332
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,120
You can see it. Trust me.

333
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,080
revolutionary

334
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
Keep your word and your deeds.

335
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,840
I Mao Zedong keep my word.

336
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm waiting for you to pay back the money.

337
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,200
Jenny, that's enough. There's too much to take. 

338
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,840
It's not that far to France.

339
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
You can eat it on the way.

340
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,040
Those are all specialties.

341
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,520
You can't eat anything when you go to France.

342
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
Ah, it's so far on the road

343
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,400
And it's hot.

344
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm afraid these won't hold.

345
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,120
Shiyan

346
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
You are going to France this time.

347
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
In addition to work-study programs

348
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
There is another important task.

349
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,920
That is, among the work-study students studying in France

350
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,280
To actively publicize and study Marxism. 

351
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,600
Make preparations for the establishment of a party group 

352
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,400
I will write to you more often, too.

353
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,960
Besides, please.

354
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,960
I often visit Yannian Qiaonian and the two of them. 

355
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,720
The situation of work-study program in France is very complicated. 

356
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
Yannian likes to get into a dead end. 

357
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
I'm still worried about him

358
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
I prepared this for them.

359
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,840
Some Chinese materials

360
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,960
You take it with you

361
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,400
You tell them

362
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,720
If they don't believe in Marxism

363
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm not willing to die. 

364
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,400
I'll definitely bring it.

365
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,160
don't worry

366
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,000
I've sealed it up for you.

367
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,040
It won't break.

368
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,840
Haiwei

369
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,520
wife of one's teacher/master

370
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,680
Once I go to France,

371
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,520
I don't know when I'll be back.

372
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
Bai Lan, we'll entrust it to you.

373
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,920
Be sure to treat her well.

374
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
Jenny, rest assured.

375
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,880
In France.

376
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,400
I will take good care of Bai Lan.

377
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,320
白兰姐姐

378
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
Yannian's brother gave it to me.

379
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,360
Take it with you. I can keep you company on the way.

380
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Sister Mei won't take Ying Ying.

381
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,240
Because sister, this time

382
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,360
It's a long journey.

383
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,640
But also by boat.

384
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm afraid English and Ying Bu will adapt.

385
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,120
So, Sister Bai Lan

386
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
You must tell.

387
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Yannian brother and Qiaonian brother.

388
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,040
Mom, dad, brother and I

389
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
I miss them very much.

390
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
Okay, I got it

391
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
Okay, time to go. 

392
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
It's getting late. Don't miss the boat.

393
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
Put it back and feed it some water. 

394
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,600
Come on, take it.

395
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,360
go

396
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,560
Shouchang's party building work is under way.

397
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,680
Communist international directive east Asia secretariat 

398
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
Help China to set up a party organization.

399
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,360
Comrade Lenin

400
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
Comrade Trotsky

401
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,480
And Comrade Stalin.

402
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,040
Are very concerned about China's problems.

403
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,560
We plan to set up the party's initiating group in advance in August.

404
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
Set an example everywhere.

405
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,080
Now I'm going to draw up a simple

406
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
The party's provisional program

407
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,760
Let's take it out for discussion and modification.

408
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,960
What is the name of our party?

409
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
It's still uncertain.

410
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,358
Some people advocate calling it the Socialist Party.

411
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,049
Some people advocate calling it the Social Communist Party.

412
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:50,198
Some people advocate calling it the Social Democratic Party.

413
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
numerous

414
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
What party is it called?

415
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
I'd like to hear your opinion.

416
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,920
Brother Zhongfu received your letter.

417
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,080
Party building work in Beijing

418
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
It is also being carried out quickly.

419
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,320
It is proposed to join the young chinese Society in the near future. 

420
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,800
Shuguang Humane Society Youth Mutual Aid Group 

421
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,120
And Tianjin Juewu Society, etc.

422
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,560
Hold a symposium

423
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,560
Discuss related issues

424
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,960
We are eagerly looking forward to the founding group of the Shanghai Party. 

425
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,080
Early establishment

426
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,840
Make a template

427
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
As for the name of the party

428
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
I firmly believe that 

429
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,040
It should be the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

430
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,640
come on

431
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,600
润之来

432
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,000
good

433
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,800
Come here.

434
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,080
Come and sit.

435
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,880
Please, sir

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,040
What have you been busy with recently?

437
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
How can I see you coming?

438
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,600
And some of my classmates from Hunan First Normal University.

439
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,600
Rented several rooms in Minxiang South.

440
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,600
Experiment with work-study life

441
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,480
For more than a month.

442
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,520
It's bitter.

443
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,040
Work-study is not easy.

444
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
At that time, Chen Yannian did experiments for two months.

445
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,400
Failed

446
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,360
Then I heard that 

447
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
Wang Guangqi has made a large-scale

448
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
And failed.

449
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,040
What about you?

450
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
We are engaged in a small experiment of several people.

451
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,560
You don't have to tell the result. 

452
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,600
And failed.

453
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,680
be

454
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,360
But sir

455
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,120
I've made my decision now.

456
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
I will never go to school again.

457
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,680
I want to take the road of independent research.

458
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,560
good

459
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,360
sir

460
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,640
Manifesto of the Communist Party

461
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I carefully read it over and over again.

462
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm sure now.

463
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,120
I want to believe in Marxism.

464
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280


465
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,280
sir

466
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
Once my faith is established

467
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,120
Will not waver.

468
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
I will fight to the end to realize communism.

469
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,600
good

470
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,960
Runzhi

471
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
That's the kind of decision you need.

472
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,720
I'm so happy.

473
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,240
You can join us.

474
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,640
We have been comrades ever since. 

475
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,240
sir

476
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,040
What is the name of our party?

477
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,360
Communist Party of China

478
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,360
good

479
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,800
Loud name

480
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,880
the past

481
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
A mountain touched by common anger.

482
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
Tianzhu breaks the earth to survive.

483
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,920
The sky inclines towards the northwest

484
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Therefore, the sun, moon and stars move.

485
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,920
Dissatisfied with southeast China 

486
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,960
This is an ancient Chinese myth.

487
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,640
There are also many heroes in western mythology.

488
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
We will be Prometheus of China.

489
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,200
Dare to steal fire without fear of punishment.

490
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
Illuminate the future for suffering China.

491
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,360
We also need to prepare.

492
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,080
To work as a co-worker.

493
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,960
A brave warrior who dares to smash the old society completely.

494
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,120
sir

495
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
I'm going back to Hunan in a few days. 

496
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
What are you going to do when you get back?

497
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
I want to hear your opinion.

498
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,600
Runzhi

499
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,800
You know I've always had high hopes for you.

500
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,240
You go back this time.

501
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
We should actively promote Marxism.

502
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
Mobilize the people

503
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
Make preparations for the establishment of the Party organization in Hunan.

504
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
I'll listen to you, sir.

505
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
I will contact you more.

506
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,000
Write to you.

507
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,920
I will write to you, too.

508
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,800
Many years later

509
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
Mazedong recalled.

510
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
In my life

511
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
This may be a critical period.

512
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,440
Chen Duxiu's words to show his faith 

513
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
Left a deep impression on me.

514
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,760
He also said

515
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,840
When is New Youth magazine available?

516
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
It was edited by Chen Duxiu.

517
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
By this magazine

518
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,680
And the May Fourth Movement.

519
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,040
Later, some joined the Communist Party.

520
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
These people are affected by Chen Duxiu

521
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,920
And a group of people around him. 

522
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,920
Can be said to be gathered by him. 

523
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,640
That's when the party was founded.

524
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,920
Comrades, today's meeting

525
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
It was proposed by Comrade En Lai.

526
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,160
They talk about advanced organizations.

527
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
And the idea of joint transformation is very good.

528
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,000
So I propose this meeting today. 

529
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,760
By the comrades of Tianjin Juewu Society

530
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
And presided over the general report.

531
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,040
What do you think?

532
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,280
Yes, comrade, please.

533
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
Since Mr. Li Dazhao ordered my generals,

534
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,480
Then you're welcome.

535
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,440
I think

536
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,560
We gathered at 

537
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
Transform the young comrades under the banner of Chi.

538
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,080
Recognize today's human beings 

539
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,800
Must be based on the spirit of love and mutual assistance.

540
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,680
Organize a union that breaks all boundaries.

541
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,120
In this alliance

542
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,320
The life of each molecule

543
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,480
Must be free and equal. 

544
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
Industrious and happy

545
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,960
To realize such a harmonious world

546
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
The life of great unity of mankind

547
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
No, first, the free people

548
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
According to their occupation

549
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
Combined with small organizations.

550
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
We are eager for various organizations

551
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,040
Realize one by one.

552
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
You can't tell people.

553
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Shouting to the people.

554
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,960
寿昌先生

555
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,880
Tell us more about it.

556
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,640
Comrades, just now, Comrade Enlai gave a speech.

557
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,520
Everyone heard it.

558
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
Very wonderful

559
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,040
Now all walks of life in the country

560
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,400
Especially the workers' movement has been started.

561
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,080
So the advanced organizations

562
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,520


563
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,920
To strengthen our own strength.

564
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,840
But the combination and transformation need a premise.

565
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,280
This question

566
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,520
Everyone should have a correct understanding. 

567
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,280
I think advanced organizations

568
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,800
First of all, it is necessary to indicate egoism.

569
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,320
Unidentified doctrine

570
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,800
There is no scientific guiding ideology.

571
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,960
Internally, it is not enough to unify the whole mind.

572
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,440
In particular, it is not enough to unite with other people's actions.

573
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Comrades, China today

574
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
Has reached our organization.

575
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,480
It's time to raise your own banner.

576
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,720
Comrades

577
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,120
Before the establishment of the party organization today 

578
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,280
I want to read it out first.

579
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
I drafted a provisional program of the party.

580
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,360
Mainly divided into party principles

581
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,280
And the purpose of the party.

582
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,560
There are three principles of the Communist Party

583
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,440
Confiscate all capital

584
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,800
Confiscation of bank mines

585
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
Abolish individual oppression 

586
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,960
Economic and social sharing

587
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Leading the working class to power

588
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,120
Down with reactionary forces

589
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,280
Transition to the elimination of political power

590
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,200
3. Eliminate all classes 

591
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,080
There are also three purposes of the Communist Party.

592
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,680
To carry out class struggle.

593
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,120
Unite workers

594
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,120
From economic struggle to political struggle

595
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,640
seize power

596
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
After gaining power

597
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,280
Develop class struggle

598
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,120
Building a communist society

599
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
Based on mass production 

600
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
If you have no opinion.

601
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,360
Please approve by applause.

602
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Comrades

603
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
According to the Communist Party of China（CPC）'s organizational principles 

604
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,680
We elect Comrade Chen Duxiu.

605
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,560
Secretary of the Executive Board of the Communist Party of China（CPC）

606
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,600
good

607
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,040
Comrades

608
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,560
From now on,

609
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,840
we are the first members

610
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,040
of the Communist Party.

611
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,680
As of today, the Chinese working class

612
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
has its own vanguard party.

613
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,880
Our name is the Communist Party of China.

614
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,640
Now, we take the oath.

615
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:14,160
[August 1920, the first branch of the Communist Party of China was established in Shanghai]

616
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,040
Chen Duxiu

617
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,160
Li Hanjun

618
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,120
Yu Xiusong

619
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,080
Shi Cuntong

620
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,200
Chen Gongpei

621
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,760
It is my will to join the Communist Party of China,

622
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,200
and fight for communism throughout my life.

623
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,834
Long live the Communist Party of China!

624
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,107
Long live the Communist Party of China!

625
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:34,722
Long live the Communist Party of China!

626
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Today, the Beijing branch of the Communist Party of China

627
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,760
is established.

628
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,120
The three of us

629
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
are fortunate to be the first party members of the branch.

630
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,280
Next, we take the oath.

631
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,360
Li Dazhao

632
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,480
Zhang Shenfu

633
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,680
Zhang Guotai

634
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,200
It is my will to join the Communist Party of China,

635
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,920
and fight for communism throughout my life.

636
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,800
Comrades, let's cheer.

637
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,402
Long live the Communist Party of China!

638
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,516
Long live the Communist Party of China!

639
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:28,957
Long live the Communist Party of China!

640
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:32,466
Long live the Communist Party of China!

641
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,440
November 1920

642
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,600
Mao Zedong's

643
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Hunan self-government movement,

644
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,880
taking peaceful petition as the main method,

645
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,080
failed.

646
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
Disappointed,

647
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,920
he went to Pingxiang, Jiangxi

648
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,160
to investigate the bottom of society's,

649
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,040
especially the Anyuan coal miners', living conditions

650
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,320
and political demands.

651
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,200
The facts and lessons learnt

652
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
made him completely get rid

653
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,000
of the ultimate fantasy of the road of reformism.

654
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,240
Without hesitation,

655
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,360
he embarked on the revolutionary road of thoroughly transforming society

656
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,520
and became a staunch Marxist.

657
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,280
stationery

658
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,120
Runzhi

659
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,800
You're back.

660
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,000
What did you get from your trip to Pingxiang?

661
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,120
Ideological journey, turn over a new leaf

662
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
Fenghuang county

663
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
Rebirth from the fire

664
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,040
you see

665
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,640
So serious

666
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,160
No wonder we were called here early in the morning.

667
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,200
What's the matter?

668
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
There is a fire in my heart.

669
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,840
I want to talk to you two.

670
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,280
What fire do you have?

671
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:53,360


672
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,680
say it out

673
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:53,760


674
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:53,920
say it out

675
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,000


676
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,640
say it out

677
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,080
I'm going to Pingxiang this time.

678
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,680
I mainly want to know about coal mines.

679
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,720
And rural areas.

680
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,320
China now

681
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,080
The whole thing is like a big stove. 

682
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,080
The common people are in dire straits and suffering greatly.

683
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,960
I can't live any longer.

684
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,880
Tell us what you saw.

685
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,920
Take Anyuan Coal Mine for example.

686
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,000


687
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,920
There are many coal diggers there.

688
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
They all have to work under the whip of the supervisor.

689
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,200
The working conditions are extremely bad.

690
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
I have to work twelve to sixteen hours a day.

691
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,320
Created so much wealth. 

692
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,640
But their wages are pitiful.

693
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,600
The miners have to live in shacks.

694
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,320
It's freezing cold in winter.

695
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
The situation in the countryside

696
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,320
Even worse.

697
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,080
This famine-stricken beggar

698
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,480
Sell children and women everywhere.

699
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,640
This country is rotten to the core.

700
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,520
What do you think?

701
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,520
I have figured it out.

702
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,360
像陈独秀

703
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
As Mr. Li Dazhao said

704
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,560
We are going to take the Russian road.

705
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,280
It is necessary to thoroughly transform the whole society.

706
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,680
It is possible to save China.

707
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,240
If you want to save China

708
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,080
There's only one way out. 

709
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,120
revolution

710
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,960
The world is our world

711
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,320
The country, our country 

712
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,200
Society, our society

713
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,760
If we don't, who will?

714
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,480
Who will do it if we don't? 

715
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,760
Comrades

716
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,560
Today is a particularly memorable day.

717
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,440
The Communist Party of China（CPC） Group was formally established.

718
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,680
Comrade Chen Duxiu, secretary of the Communist Party of China（CPC）

719
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,040
Because I'm going to Guangdong 

720
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,640
Take office as chairman of the Education Committee.

721
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,600
You can't attend.

722
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,440
The founding ceremony of Changsha Group.

723
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,960
He entrusted me to host it.

724
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,560
In view of the current situation

725
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,080
This matter can't be made public yet 

726
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,800
We should carry out activities in secret.

727
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,760
the moment

728
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,840
Our main tasks are as follows.

729
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,320
The first is to transform Xinmin Society. 

730
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,080
Make it a party organization.

731
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,840
The second is to establish Hunan Socialist Youth League.

732
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,880
the moment

733
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,440
Let's raise our fists. 

734
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,960
Cry softly

735
00:34:47,680 --> 00:35:27,520
The Communist Party of China（CPC） Fang sui

736
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Songnian xiansheng

737
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
This is after I came to Europe

738
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,680
Notes on studying Marxist works

739
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,800
And thoughts.

740
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
I am willing to accept the organization's inspection.

741
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,720
Well, come and sit down, comrade.

742
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
I understand your past situation.

743
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,840
I want to hear

744
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,760
Changes in your mind since you came to Europe

745
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
I arrived in Europe at the end of last year.

746
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,360
I lived in England for more than a month.

747
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
It mainly inspects the workers' movement in Britain.

748
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,600
Through this investigation and research

749
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
Help me understand several popular doctrines in Europe.

750
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,840
The deduction and comparison are made.

751
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,960
Final determination

752
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,600
British Fabian socialism or fantasy?

753
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,160
Russia's October Revolution is the right road.

754
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,680
When we get to Europe.

755
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,440
How many Marx books have you read? 

756
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,600
When I was studying in Japan 

757
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,280
I have been exposed to Marxism.

758
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,400
in the country/at home

759
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,080
It's with Mr. Li Dazhao again.

760
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,240
I have read some Marxist books.

761
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,760
After coming to Europe?

762
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,600
I read systematically again.

763
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,800
Manifesto of the Communist Party

764
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
Socialism from Utopia to Science

765
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
State and Revolution, etc.

766
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
Classical works of Marxism

767
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
This notebook records my heart.

768
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,240
Now I'm sure

769
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,800
I have established the belief of communism.

770
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,520
So I asked to join the Communist Party of China（CPC）.

771
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,240
Comrade Enlai

772
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,800
I know a lot about your situation now. 

773
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,240
Before I came to Europe?

774
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
Comrade Chen Duxiu and Ji Dazhao

775
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,360
Entrusted Zhao Shiyan and me

776
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,960
Responsible for the formation of the Communist Party of China（CPC）

777
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,480
Communist group in France

778
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,880
And give us the power to develop Party members.

779
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,920
I'm with Qingyang.

780
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I am very willing to be your party sponsor.

781
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,560
I have talked with Shiyan about the specific situation.

782
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,240
I went to report the letter to Mr. Zhongfu.

783
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,480
Now I'm waiting for his reply.

784
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,360
good

785
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,680
How about now

786
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Work-study program is the most difficult time. 

787
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,760
The ranks of international students are very different.

788
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,880
We should take advantage of the situation and do more work.

789
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,240
Unite more comrades.

790
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,680
Join our team.

791
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,200
Enlai

792
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Chen Yannian and Chen Qiaonian's work

793
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,240
How's it going?

794
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
I discussed it with Shiyan.

795
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
To do the work of both of them together 

796
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,400
Mr. Song Nian graciously came.

797
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,560
Mr. Zhongfu agreed to our party building plan.

798
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,800
Request the Communist Party of China（CPC） Travel Law Group 

799
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,280
By Zhang Shenfu Zhao Shiyan Chen Gongpei

800
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,280
Zhou Enlai is composed of five people.

801
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,360
And asked us to actively develop other party members.

802
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,440
That's great, that's great.

803
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,400
Now I declare

804
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,520
The the Communist Party of China（CPC） Travel Law Group was formally established. 

805
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:29,520
Long live the communist party of China

806
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,320
Since the second half of 1920

807
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:34,640


808
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,640

Shen Fu Zhou Enlai Zhao Shiyan Chen Gongpei and others are in France.

815
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,080
Communist Party groups have been established successively.

816
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,000
Announce a few things

817
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
"New Youth" from the eighth issue

818
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,920
Actually, it is

819
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,600
The Communist Party of China（CPC）'s official publications.

820
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,160
No longer by Beijing and Shanghai colleagues. 

821
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,440
Rotation editing system 

822
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880
By me and Chen Wangdao.

823
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,480
And Lida Li Hanjun.

824
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Shen Yanbing is in charge of editing.

825
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,800
Second, "New Youth" will increase 

826
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,480
Marxist studies

827
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
And Russian studies.

828
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,880
Two key columns

829
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,720
And at the same time continue to shoulder

830
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,800
An important task of propagating new ideas and new cultures.

831
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,960
Third, from this issue

832
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,760
Editorial colleagues organize their own new youth clubs. 

833
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,160
Directly in charge of the editorial department

834
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
Everything about printing and distribution. 

835
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,640
Break away from formal Qunyi Bookstore.

836
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,440
At No.279 Fada Road, French Concession, Shanghai

837
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,720
Set up general distribution office

838
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
And in 43 regions of the country

839
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
Set up 94 representative offices.

840
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,680
good

841
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,400
Great

842
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,200
good

843
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,880
This is the cover of the new design of New Youth.

844
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
Editors express their opinions.

845
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,520
Two big hands clasped tightly on the earth.

846
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,600
What does this picture mean?

847
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,080
I guess it indicates China.

848
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,960
And after the October Revolution

849
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,240
Russia's unity and cooperation

850
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,600
Shake hands cordially with the Chinese and Russian parties. 

851
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,960
But not hugs.

852
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,960
That way.

853
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,640
This picture is very meaningful.

854
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,080
Good!

855
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,760
Comrades, the situation is developing rapidly now.

856
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,080
Study and publicize Marxism.

857
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,200
Already.

858
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
The trend of starting a prairie fire in China's ideological circle 

859
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,960
irresistible

860
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,400
But at the same time

861
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,680
The camp of the new culture movement is also undergoing fission

862
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,960
What happened?

863
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
Something happened about China.

864
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,280
Should take the socialist road.

865
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,880
Or the capitalist road?

866
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,280
Is the implementation of social revolution.

867
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
Or is it a big debate about social improvement?

868
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,960
Marxism also happened at the same time.

869
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,000
Great controversy with anarchism

870
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,320
Comrades, these two debates

871
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,120
It concerns the future of the Chinese revolution.

872
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
So I hope

873
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,760
We, Peking University Research Institute of Marxist Theory

874
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,200
And the upcoming

875
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,520
Comrades of the Communist Party of China（CPC） Branch

876
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,160
Be sure to take an active part in these two big debates.

877
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,280
The flag clearly shows our attitude.

878
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,880
New youth

879
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,880
And the upcoming Communist Party magazine.

880
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
Is our position.

881
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,000
good
