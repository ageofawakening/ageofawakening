[The Age of Awakening]

2
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:11,026
[Episode Thirty-nine]

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
Guangdong military government has approved it. 

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,320
Chen Jiongming's plan

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
Cui Bei wants to organize Southwest University.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,280
Entrust Zhang Shizhao and others.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
There are two of us as organizers.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
Take charge of the preparation plan for going to Southwest University.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,680
Zhang Shizhao, say it.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,600
He said he wanted you. 

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,760
Go to Shanghai to meet him.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,360
Then go to Guangzhou.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,520
Something happened suddenly and I had to think about it.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,240
Besides, I have to consult Junman.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,960
Master Cai

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,400


17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,520
The reason why I invited you here

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,040
I just want to discuss with you.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,920
I sincerely hope you can be like me.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,240
The main business is still in Peking University

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,200
Look at the Song History class next semester. 

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,800
Everything has been arranged for you.

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,080
And I really hope 

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
The two of us can be together

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,440
Put the new culture movement

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
Make it more thorough.

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,760
Zhongfu, I don't approve of your going to Guangzhou either.

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,840
Where is not suitable for you?

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,200
Why?

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
There are too many radicals in the south.

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
You must go to extremes when you go there.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
I'll miss your learning.

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
Master Cai Shizhi

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
The country has come to this.

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,200
Where else can it be?

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
What knowledge am I going to do?

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,120
Master Cai

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
About leaving Peking University.

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
I've made it clear to you. 

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,400
I've made up my mind. Please don't persuade me again. 

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,240
As for whether to go to Guangdong or not

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,160
Let me think again.

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,480
be it so

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
行蔡大师

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,760
Then leave now.

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
Are you really leaving Beijing?

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
There are many factions in Beiyang government.

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
Has lost control of the whole country.

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,200
Compared with the southern government, it is more dynamic.

50
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,200
It also has appeal.

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
Now Dr. Sun Yat-sen

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,120
Put the Chinese Revolutionary Party under his leadership 

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
Has been reorganized into the Chinese Kuomintang.

54
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,800
And statute to consolidate the Republic.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,600
Realize the Three People's Principles for the purpose. 

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,920
If dr sun yat-sen

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
Be able to control the southern government 

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,560
The Beiyang government will be abolished in the future. 

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,840
Unified China

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
I think if I go to the south now

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
There may be more opportunities.

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,200
So are we going to move our family to the south?

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
I want to make an appointment with Zhang Shizhao first.

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,680
Let's talk about it in Shanghai.

65
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,440
Besides, YannianQiaonian is going to France.

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
I also want to see them off.

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,880
I feel really sorry for the two children.

68
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,160
The expenses for Bai Lan have been collected.

69
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Yannian and Qiaonian's are not enough.

70
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,320
No money went to France.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,720
I'm really worried about something wrong with them.

72
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
The two children are used to being independent.

73
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
Don't beat them.

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,320
December 1969

75
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,400


76
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
Hunan Day, December, 1919

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:45,760


78
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,400

79
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,360
To rebel against warlord Zhang Jingyao

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,080
To rebel against warlord Zhang Jingyao

81
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,160


82
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,240


83
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,320


84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,560
To rebel against warlord Zhang Jingyao

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:48,640


86
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,040
The reactionary rule in Hunan

87
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,520
Mazedong led a campaign.

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,080
A massive drive to spread tension.

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
18 December

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,240
Mazedong led the delegation.

91
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,880
Forty people arrived in Beijing. 

92
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,080
Expose Zhang Jingyao's crime of harming Hunan and abusing people.

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,240
Strive for the support of the national theory for the anti-Zhang movement 

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,240
This is the electricity to expose Zhang Jingyao's top ten crimes.

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
Send it out right away.

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,240
This declaration of expulsion 

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
Print another 30 copies.

98
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,120
Send it to every newspaper immediately.

99
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,720
come

100
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,720
This is what I just wrote. 

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,640
For Jin Yunpeng, the government of the Republic of China. 

102
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Quzhang Chengwen

103
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,120
Print fifteen copies.

104
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,840
I need it tomorrow afternoon.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,560
good

106
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,320
Runzhi

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,400
Look who's here.

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
Runzhi

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,320
middle

Runzhi

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,120
Don't sit up and take notice in March 

114
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,280
sit up and take notice

115
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
sit up and take notice

116
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:42,640
sit up and take notice

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:42,800
sit up and take notice

118
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,240
This blink of an eye

119
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
President of civilian news agency

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
A famous journalist in Ninetowns.

121
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
remarkable

122
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
Students, this is Zhong Jie.

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
Mr. Shouchang invited him to visit everyone. 

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,600
welcome

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,680
Hello, classmates.

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,480
Mr. Shouchang asked Zhong Jie to bring us a truckload of charcoal.

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
Help everyone to get it at the door.

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,640
Duishen

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,360
Slow down

130
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,080
come on

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,360
Warm up

132
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,040
come

133
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm driving ducks to the shelves. 

134
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,200
thank you

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,440
Learn by doing.

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
But honestly, hand, I missed you guys so much.

137
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,280
You can also see it.

138
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
I'm tied up at the moment. 

139
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,880
Have you been too busy with this?

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,480
I'm going to see Mr. Shouchang.

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,200
I have a lot to tell him.

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,160
Mr. Shouchang often reads to us, too. How about you?

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,440
Runzhi

144
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,880
I brought you a nice thing.

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,360
Guess what this is

146
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,040
Come and smell

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,920
Taste of home

148
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,280
寿昌先生

149
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,000
I asked Jenny to fry the spicy oil for you.

150
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,120
Afraid you're not enough.

151
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,240
Ah, specialized

152
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,520
Blow up two cans at once.

153
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,440
This should be enough for you to eat.

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
Mr. Shouchang also said a word

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,760
Runzhi will worry without Chili oil.

156
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,640
This campaign is less energetic.

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,240
Thank Jenny for me.

158
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,840
Thank you, Mr. Shouchang

159
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,320
Not only Mr. Shouchang

160
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Mr. Zhongfu also praised you.

161
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,040
classmates

162
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
I brought it to everyone.

163
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
The latest issue of New Youth

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720

Come to you.

169
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,920
中富先生

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
Specially in this issue of "New Youth"

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,280
Wrote an article

172
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,360
To support your anti-Zhang movement

173
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,200
The title of this article is called

174
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,680
Welcome to Hunan People's Spirit

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
Let me read you a paragraph.

176
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,720
The spirit we can't fight for.

177
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Gradually in class one.

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,080
Lovely and respectable young people.

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,600
I heard this kind of voice.

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
Great joy

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
Almost shed tears.

182
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,560
good

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,840
come

184
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,480
it suddenly occurs to me that

185
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,200
Mr. Zhongfu has been in some trouble recently.

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
Is he okay now?

187
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,600
中富先生

188
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
I have gone from Beijing to Shanghai now.

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,800
I have a hunch.

190
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
He will do something soon.

191
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
Earth-shattering event

192
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,600
Great

193
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,440
I went to Shanghai this time.

194
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,040
Be sure to visit him.

195
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
Now the whole city of Beijing

196
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
Are talking about your campaign to drive Zhang.

197
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
How's it going?

198
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
Had some trouble.

199
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
This Beiyang government is like a merry-go-round

200
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,240
Change prime minister

201
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,920
Now this Jin Yunpeng

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
move in and out with wizardly elusiveness

203
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,400
I can't touch his tip.

204
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
I can't touch his tip.

205
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,720
Let me give you an idea.

206
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,880
He is just behind the cotton beard. 

207
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,000
He lives in Mianhua Hutong.

208
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Go to his house.

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,920
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

210
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,480
Xiangmin is in dire straits.

211
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,960
There is no hope that poison will not kill Hunan. 

212
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

213
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,760
Xiangmin is in dire straits.

214
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
Zhang du bu Chu

215
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,320
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

216
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,560
Xiangmin is in dire straits.

217
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
There is no hope that poison will not kill Hunan. 

218
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

219
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,760
Xiangmin pain

220
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
Everybody!

221
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
The Prime Minister is busy with official business today.

222
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,440
I'll tell you if you have anything.

223
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
Everybody!

224
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,520
Hopeless Hunan

225
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
On behalf of all Hunan people

226
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Ask Zhang Jingyao to be expelled from Hunan.

227
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,200
How did Zhang Jingyao offend you?

228
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,680
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

229
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,920
Xiangmin is in dire straits.

230
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,840
This is our petition.

231
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
Please forward it to the Prime Minister for a look.

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:09,680
There is no hope that poison will not kill Hunan. 

233
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,400
Adjutant Yu

234
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,880
There is no hope that poison will not kill Hunan. 

235
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,240
Zhang Jingyao has a big crime.

236
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
The soldiers hurt the people.

237
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,240
Make farmers unable to cultivate and businesses unable to market.

238
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,520
Sin one

239
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
Financial congestion

240
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,360
The second sin

241
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
Public and private bankruptcy will be restored indefinitely.

242
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
The third sin

243
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
Letting people plant tobacco damage the national system. 

244
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,120
Laughing at the world's four sins 

245
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,240
The destruction of education keeps students out of school.

246
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,720
There is nothing to learn.

247
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
Assassination of citizens violates the criminal law.

248
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,480
The sixth sin

249
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,680
So many crimes.

250
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,880
What else do you want?

251
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
We ask the government

252
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
Immediately expel Zhang Jingyao from Hunan.

253
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,200
There is no hope that poison will not kill Hunan. 

254
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480
I see. Rest assured, everyone.

255
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,200
I understand, everyone. Don't worry

256
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,920
I will certainly tell the Prime Minister your request.

257
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,240
Okay, okay, okay.

258
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,680
Good school manager

259
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,880
Yannian is here

260
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
Manager Wang said you wanted to see me.

261
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,960
Is something the matter？ 

262
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
Boy, I find you're in a hurry.

263
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Come sit down and have a cup of tea. 

264
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,400
good

265
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,040
come

266
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,320
Thank you, school manager.

267
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,800
延年啊

268
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
Today, we'll have a frank talk.

269
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,560
good

270
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
Can I ask you two questions?

271
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,960
Uncle, say

272
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,760
Tell me what your ambition is.

273
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I want to be a country that can serve.

274
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,240
One who serves the people.

275
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,000
How do you want to serve your country?

276
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,120
For example, being the leader of the country.

277
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,320
Or overthrow the regime of this country.

278
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,400
Build another country.

279
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
No, uncle, none of this. 

280
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm not interested in being an official

281
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
I just hope that our country

282
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
Don't be controlled by foreigners.

283
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,520
People are not bullied by officials.

284
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,960
People can live a good life. 

285
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
Then form a mutual help and love.

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
Such a harmonious big family.

287
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,080
I am willing to fight for it.

288
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,760
How do you want to fight?

289
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
I am willing to die for my country. 

290
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,880
Yannian, can you tell me

291
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,520
What do you mean by dedication?

292
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,400
Is dedication.

293
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,320
I am always willing to sacrifice myself for my country. 

294
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,880
How can you think of sacrifice at an early age? 

295
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,960
Do you have to do this?

296
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,600
Uncle, I think in a country like ours

297
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,920
Want to realize such an ideal

298
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
There is no other way to choose.

299
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,800
I ask you

300
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Your relationship with Liu Mei

301
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,920
What do you want to do with it?

302
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,440
Actually, this question

303
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,880
I have answered you just now. 

304
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
You answered me just now. 

305
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,480
Then you have to forgive your uncle Liu's stupidity.

306
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
I really don't understand.

307
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,800
I told you just now.

308
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,800
I'm willing to

309
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,080
For this country and its people.

310
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
So I have no intention of starting a family.

311
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,120
As a follower of anarchism

312
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
I don't advocate starting a family.

313
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,040
As an anarchist communist

314
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,280
I abide by the six noes.

315
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,200
Don't fall in love or have personal relationships.

316
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
It is also the proper meaning of it.

317
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,240
Yannian

318
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,760
There are many people advocating anarchism in China. 

319
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,520
But which one is not married?

320
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
Which one doesn't fall in love

321
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,520
Why do you want to go to this extreme?

322
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
You know, Liu Mei, in order to follow you

323
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,920
She abandoned everything.

324
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,920
You think you're doing this

325
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
Are you worthy of her? 

326
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,280
uncle

327
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,640
I know you came to see me about Liu Mei. 

328
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
So I must answer you honestly.

329
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,640
I do this.

330
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
It is also for Liu Mei's happiness.

331
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,640
I do this.

332
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
It is also from the lessons of our family for so many years.

333
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
Make a decision

334
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,920
How do you say this?

335
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
My father Chen Duxiu

336
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,600
Is an existing lofty ideal.

337
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A revolutionary who wants to have a family.

338
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
But I think

339
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
In our disaster-stricken country

340
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,920
It's impossible to do both. 

341
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,880
I can't repeat the same mistakes.

342
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
Your heart is here.

343
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,960
Uncle, didn't you just ask me about my ambition?

344
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
I can give you a definite answer now.

345
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
From small rural areas to cities.

346
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
I felt it personally.

347
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,760
Corruption in this country and suffering of the people 

348
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,360
Now I'm determined to fight for

349
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,200
The strength of the country and the happiness of the people 

350
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,720
Sacrifice everything

351
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,920
I can't do it both ways like some people do.

352
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,080
So I have to sacrifice myself.

353
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,680
proceed without hesitation

354
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,320
I see./I got it.

355
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,960
Sit down.

356
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,080
As an elder, I admire your ambition very much

357
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,520
And I also firmly believe that

358
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
You will have an extraordinary life.

359
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,480
You and your father are made of special materials. 

360
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,920
I'm not.

361
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,760
Liu Mei is my daughter.

362
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
I am responsible for her life.

363
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Do you understand me when I say this? 

364
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,200
clear

365
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,120
So I don't agree.

366
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,000
She went to France to work and study with you.

367
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,320
She doesn't need work-study now.

368
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,080
Now she needs to be in a famous foreign university.

369
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,400
Read quietly.

370
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,400
Please forgive me.

371
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
There's nothing I can do. 

372
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:21,920
uncle

373
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,800
Then what else do I need to do?

374
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,880
What you need to do now 

375
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,280
Just do nothing.

376
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,920
Everything goes with the flow.

377
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,080
Don't hate me either.

378
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,600
good

379
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
Come a little closer

380
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,760
Help him with it.

381
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,280
good

382
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,960
Look at the camera.

383
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,520
good

384
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
A little bit of the bride's veil.

385
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,840
I'll do it.

386
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,440
Okay, okay, okay.

387
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,120
Yannian, about my dad talking to you. 

388
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,480
He told me everything.

389
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
And I know what you think. 

390
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
I can't accompany you to France.

391
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know why recently.

392
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,320
Memories are always one scene after another. 

393
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
Appear in my mind 

394
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,680
Remember the first time we met?

395
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,360
At Aurora School

396
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,640
We had a fight.

397
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,560
It has been more than four years now. 

398
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,760
We went from Shanghai to Beijing. 

399
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,280
From Beijing to Shanghai 

400
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
I remember we had a frugal canteen together.

401
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,800
Feed the lambs together

402
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,080
Yiqibao steamed bun

403
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,760
Let's play live drama together.

404
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,720
Down with Wang Jingxuan

405
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,760
Together we make a puppet 

406
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,320
Go to prison and hand out leaflets on the street.

407
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,040
I remember everything.

408
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,360
How I want to stay in yesterday!

409
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
But time can't stop

410
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,040
I wish I didn't want to be here today.

411
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,680
But it's still here today.

412
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
Yannian, do you remember what I told you?

413
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,280
How much I admire you! 

414
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,720
You can fly proudly and fly freely.

415
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,920
Rely on home

416
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,560
I wanted to fly with you.

417
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,640
But today I found out.

418
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
I can't fly high.

419
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
I can't fly out either.

420
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,120
I made a detour.

421
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
I went back to this cage.

422
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,800
Do you remember what I told you

423
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
Those three words are not in my dictionary.

424
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,240
But you're going to France soon.

425
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't go with you

426
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,000
I want to say sorry.

427
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,560
I see

428
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,240
I'm ugly and stupid.

429
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
I can't do anything you ask me to do well. 

430
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,200
But there is one thing. 

431
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,360
I know I can't fool myself.

432
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,920
It's me all the time

433
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
My heart is full of you. 

434
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,640
I just want to ask.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
On the road of your future life

436
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,480
Without me

437
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,000
done

438
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,720
I see

439
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
You're going to France

440
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,880
I can't see you off.

441
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,560
Take care of yourself and have a safe trip.

442
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm leaving

443
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,560
Time is like running water

444
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,000
I'll be home from school after class.

445
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,760
Let's think it over for a while.

446
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
Today, I masturbate.

447
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,360
What the teacher said 

448
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,560
Have you ever violated it?

449
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,320
Parents' expectations

450
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,760
We went all the way to Moluya.

451
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,680
Governing the country in the future

452
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Depends on our generation.

453
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,480
Everybody work hard!

454
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,360
Everybody work hard!

455
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
classmates

456
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,840
classmates

457
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,760
See you tomorrow.

458
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,240
I'm sorry

459
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Boys and girls, put the boxes in the car first.

460
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,520
Put it here first, put it here first

461
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
Move someone else's first, move someone else's first

462
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,080


463
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,880


464
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,640
Let me help you with your suitcase.

465
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,440
Male students help female students move.

466
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Put this on that.

467
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,840
Yannian

468
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,440
Qiaonian

469
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,200
Put all the luggage in the front. 

470
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,960
come on

471
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,680
I help you.

472
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,280
Thank you, Shen

473
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
Everybody, put your luggage in the front.

474
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,280
good

475
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,800
Students quickly put their luggage on the bus. 

476
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,840
Qiaonian

477
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,240
Sister, I'll do it. I'll do it.

478
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,160
Pack big luggage in the car.

479
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,080
Slow down

480
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,400
Slow down

481
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:46,960
It's really heavy

482
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,840
Your family didn't come.

483
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
I didn't tell them. I don't think they know.

484
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,240
Sister Lai

485
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,360
Give it to me.

486
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
Slow down sideways.

487
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,280
dad

488
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,800
dad

489
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,120
I auntie didn't come

490
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,640
Auntie is in Beijing without you.

491
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,560
It's better not to come and cry.

492
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,240
What she asked me to bring you.

493
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,720
What do you bring?

494
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,040
Let's see it on the boat.

495
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,960
I fried pumpkin seeds. 

496
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,800
Be confused

497
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,640
It's a mess. It's your style of frying

498
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm in a bad mood.

499
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,160
Come on, this is enough for you to eat in France

500
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,360
come on

501
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,920
You take this.

502
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:20,960
Take this, take this.

503
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,360
It's ok.

504
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,320
Give me this.

505
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,080
come on

506
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,120
Is everyone here?

507
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,880
time is up

508
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,160
It's time for us to start. 

509
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:18,947
[4 July 1927, Shanghai Longhua Police Headquarters Detention Center]

510
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:41,145
[6 June 1928, Shanghai Longhua Police Headquarters Detention Center]

511
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:40,397
[Chen Yannian, Alternate member of the 5th Central Committee Politburo of the Communist Party of China, revolutionary martyr. Arrested in Shanghai in 1927, he refused to kneel, and was hacked to death by the Kuomintang, aged 29.]

512
00:30:53,464 --> 00:31:06,685
[Chen Qiaonian, Member of the 5th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, revolutionary martyr. Killed by the Kuomintang in Longhua, Shanghai in 1928, aged 26.]

513
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,280
Recalling the past?

514
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,840
The Old House of Bai Wenwei of Hunan and Anhui Comrades Association

515
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
vigorous

516
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,240
No one here knows you better than you.

517
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,680
Still mountains and rivers

518
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,000
It's hard to be calm

519
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,760
Brother Hangyan would like to thank you for saving me. 

520
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,240
Otherwise, I would still be in the picture.

521
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,720
Zhongfu, why should I thank you? 

522
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,640
sit

523
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,240
Zhongfu, I've already let the word out.

524
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,400
Zhang Shizhao is willing to be Chen Duxiu.

525
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,920
Life-long free nurse listener

526
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,120
Afraid of you later.

527
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,880
There are many places where I can be used.

528
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,080
What do you mean?

529
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,960
Free lawyer for life.

530
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,120
There are many places where you can still be used.

531
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,120
You mean I still have to go in?

532
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,880
A slip of the tongue

533
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,080


534
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,640
You don't have to be scared.

535
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:38,720


536
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,800
Maybe you hit it right.

537
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,200
No, in the future

538
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,960
Really will be in and out of the lab many times.

539
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,160
I hear you now have an obvious

540
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,000
Marx and the tendency of Russian revolution.

541
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,960
Is it right to transform China?

542
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,000
Have a new set of views.

543
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm still exploring.

544
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,680
The Road of October Revolution

545
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,440
It really inspired me a lot. 

546
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,920
President Meng of Wuhan Wenhua College

547
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,840
I've heard a lot about you, Chen Duxiu 

548
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,600
I have asked you to give lectures in Hankou many times. 

549
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,920
Look, you just got out of prison.

550
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,440
I finally came out again. 

551
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Why don't you preach in the past? 

552
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,560
Yes, I'd like to go.

553
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,120
What a happy promise!

554
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay, I'll tell you the next thing

555
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,840
Things in Southwest University 

556
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
After Mr. Zhongshan founded the Kuomintang

557
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,120
Guangdong government strongly advocates ideological and cultural education.

558
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,960
So let Chen Jiongming brew it for years.

559
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,440
The proposal to set up Southwest University was passed.

560
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,120
The military government also specializes in

561
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
Allocate one million yuan for preparation.

562
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,800
This Chen Jiongming adores you. 

563
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,440
I want to dig you into Guangdong to educate him.

564
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,360
Let me send you a telegram.

565
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,360
You made an appointment here to talk about it. 

566
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,200
He is afraid that you will change.

567
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,920
And let me specially bring a letter of engagement.

568
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,520
otherwise

569
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,560
Let's go in and hold an engagement ceremony.

570
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,680
You don't ask me if I want to.

571
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,480
That's it.

572
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,440
You this

573
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Why don't you want to come to Shanghai?

574
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,000
And I also know

575
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
You sneaked out.

576
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,760
Coming

577
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,480
Hello, Jenny

578
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,080
Is sir at home?

579
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,200
not be in 

580
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,080
At the invitation of Mr. Zhang Tuzhao

581
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,120
At the invitation of Mr Zhang Zhao.

582
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,120
I went to Shanghai on business and haven't come back yet.

583
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,040
I have been ordered to say hello to my husband. 

584
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,240
Nothing else.

585
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,520
excuse me

586
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,320
good-bye

587
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,120
Shi mu Liu bu

588
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,040
Fellow students

589
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,040
For more than half a year

590
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,480
The biggest change in China 

591
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,560
There is nothing better than the wisdom of the people and the prosperity of the people. 

592
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,400
People are up.

593
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,920
Put forward the requirements of transforming society.

594
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,680
I personally think

595
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,800
This is the greatest achievement of the May 4th Movement. 

596
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,000
good

597
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,240
What kind of requirements should social transformation meet?

598
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
Everyone is very concerned about this problem.

599
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,440
I spent 90 days in prison.

600
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,440
Have some ideas about this problem.

601
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,120
Different ideas from the past

602
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,000
Today, I will talk about it with you. 

603
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,440
Social transformation

604
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,880
To break the system of class.

605
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,280
Implement civilian socialism. 

606
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,240
Everyone should not have vanity.

607
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,400
Break the system of inheritance

608
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,680
Break the system of inheritance

609
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,880
It is necessary to carry out joint labor.

610
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,240
Let unproductive pain enjoy productive enjoyment.

611
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,920
To break the legacy system.

612
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,280
Don't let the land pass on privately.

613
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,920
Communism that should be classified as society

614
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,000
Those who don't farm should not enjoy the right to farm.

615
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,400
This is what Marx said.

616
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,800
To eliminate the private property system.

617
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,040
Okay, okay, okay.

618
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,360
Such social transformation requires us to

619
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,160
Two beliefs must be established.

620
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,440
That is, the belief in equality and the belief in labor. 

621
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,440
Everyone should be educated.

622
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,880
Should work often.

623
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,320
Always have equal labor in your heart.

624
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,600
And the revolution of labor.

625
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,280
Today we talk about transforming society.

626
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,920
It is a fundamental transformation of society.

627
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,280
Not improvement.

628
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
The so-called transformation of Ben 

629
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,120
It means when necessary. 

630
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,720
We must resort to bloody revolution.

631
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,240
Of course, we haven't arrived today.

632
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,520
During the bloody revolution.

633
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,960
But we always have to have 

634
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,960
Research methods and beliefs of revolution

635
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,600
It's time for revolution.

636
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,800
We have to fight the devil.

637
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,920
good

638
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,320
good

639
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,160
good

640
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,840
Mr. Chen

641
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,200
Come here

642
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,920
what's up

643
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,720
Mr. Chen is not good.

644
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,800
We have caused you trouble.

645
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,880
What's the trouble

646
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Wuhan authorities heard that Mr. Chen

647
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,680
Today's talk about socialist ideas 

648
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,880
Be appalled

649
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,800
A circular has been issued.

650
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,720
Mr. Chen is forbidden to speak.

651
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
And will expel you from Han.

652
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,520
I came to tell you.

653
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,240
Please try to leave Wuhan as soon as possible. 

654
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,360
Save yourself from being killed.

655
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,320
I am a scholar by XXL.

656
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,720
It's a great honor.

657
00:40:51,840 --> 00:41:01,120
支持陈独秀

658
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,360
When will Mom come back?

659
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,720
It's been a long time.

660
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,560
Dad will be back soon. 

661
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,200
Dad will bring you delicious food when he comes back.

662
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,200
Do you miss your father?

663
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,200
Of course I miss him.

664
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,640
Mom misses dad, too.

665
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,160
dad

666
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,120
dad

667
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
How can you speak of the devil?

668
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,160
What delicious food did you bring me, Dad?

669
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,520
sesame candy

670
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
How's it going? Have you seen Yannian and them?

671
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,320
Hurry up and slow down

672
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
Finally, they met before they set off.

673
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,280
that's good

674
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,880
Come into the house

675
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,280
Brother Zhongfu is at home, right?
