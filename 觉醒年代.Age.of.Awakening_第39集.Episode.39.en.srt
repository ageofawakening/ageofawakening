The reason why I invited you here

Why?

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
There are too many radicals in the south.

About leaving Peking University,

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
I've made it clear to you.

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,400
I've made up my mind. Please don't persuade me again.

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,240
As for whether to go to Guangdong or not,

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,160
let me think again.

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Very well.

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Well. Master Cai. Shizhi.

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,760
I will leave now.

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
Are you really leaving Beijing?

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
There are many factions in the Beiyang government

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
who have lost control of the whole country.

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,200
Comparing the two, the South has a dynamic government.

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,200
It also has appeal.

54
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
Now Mr. Sun Yat-sen

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,120
has reorganized the Chinese Revolutionary Party under his leadership

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
into the Chinese Kuomintang (=Nationalist Party)

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,800
with the aim of consolidating the Republic

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,600
and realizing the Three Principles of the People.

59
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,920
If Mr. Sun Yat-sen

60
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
is able to control the southern government,

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,560
the Beiyang government will be abolished in the future

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,840
and China will be unified.

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
I think if I go to the south now,

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
there may be more opportunities.

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,200
So are we going to move our family to the south?

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760

No money, and going to France.

74
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,720

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
Had some trouble.

189
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
This Beiyang government is like a merry-go-round,

190
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,240
changing premiers.

191
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,920
Now this Jin Yunpeng

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
is moving in and out with wizardly elusiveness.

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,440
I can't feel the end of his queue.

194
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,720
Let me give you an idea.

195
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
He is just behind the Mianhua Hutong.

196
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Go to his house.

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,920
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

198
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,520
[Private residence of Jin Yunpeng]

199
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,480
Hunan people is in dire straits.

200
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,960
No hope for Hunan unless Zhang's poison is removed.

201
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

202
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,760
Hunan people is in dire straits.

203
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
No hope for Hunan unless Zhang's poison is removed.

204
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,320
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

205
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,560
Hunan people is in dire straits.

206
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
No hope for Hunan unless Zhang's poison is removed.

207
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

208
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,760
Hunan people--

209
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
Everyone. Everyone.

210
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
The Prime Minister is busy with official business today.

211
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,440
I'll tell you if you have anything.

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
Everyone. Everyone.

213
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,520
No hope for Hunan--

214
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
On behalf of all Hunan people,

215
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
we ask Zhang Jingyao to be expelled from Hunan.

216
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,200
How did Zhang Jingyao offend you?

217
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,680
Zhang's poison is evil to Hunan.

218
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,920
Hunan people is in dire straits.

219
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,840
This is our petition.

220
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
Please forward it to the Prime Minister for a look.

221
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:09,680
No hope for Hunan unless Zhang's poison is removed.

222
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,400
Adjutant Yu.

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,880
No hope for Hunan unless Zhang's poison is removed.

224
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,240
Zhang Jingyao has committed ten crimes.

225
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
His soldiers hurt the people

226
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,240
and made farmers unable to cultivate and businesses unable to market.

227
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,520
First sin.

228
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
Financial congestion, no way to make a living.

229
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,360
Second sin.

230
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
Public and private bankruptcy, the recovery is indefinite.

231
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
Third sin.

232
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
The people were forced to grow tobacco, ruining the country,

233
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,120
making the world laugh. Fourth sin.

234
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,240
Disrupting education, leaving students without a school to attend,

235
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,720
having nothing to learn. Fifth sin.

236
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
Assassination of citizens, violating criminal law.

237
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Sixth sin.

238
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,680
So many crimes.

239
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,880
What else do you want?

240
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
We ask the government

241
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
to immediately expel Zhang Jingyao from Hunan.

242
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,200
No hope for Hunan unless Zhang's poison is removed.

243
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480
I see. Rest assured, everyone.

244
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,200
I understand, everyone. Don't worry.

245
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,920
I will certainly tell the Prime Minister your request.

246
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,240
Hurrah! Hurrah!

247
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,117
[Shanghai]

248
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,680
Hello, sir.

249
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,880
Yannian is here.

250
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,601
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

251
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
Manager Wang said you wanted to see me.

252
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,960
Is something the matter？

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
Boy, I find you're in a hurry.

254
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Come sit down and have a cup of tea.

255
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,400
Well.

256
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,040
Here.

257
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,320
Thank you, sir.

258
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,800
Yannian.

259
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
Today, we'll have a frank talk.

260
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,560
Okay.

261
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
Can I ask you two questions?

262
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,960
Of course, uncle.

263
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,760
Tell me what your ambition is.

264
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I want to serve the country

265
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,240
and the people.

266
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,000
How do you want to serve your country?

267
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,120
For example, being the leader of the country?

268
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,320
Or overthrow the regime of this country?

269
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,400
Build another country?

270
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
No, uncle, none of this.

271
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm not interested in being an official.

272
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
I just hope that our country

273
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
won't controlled by foreigners.

274
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,520
People won't bullied by officials.

275
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,960
People can live a good life.

276
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
And then form a big family

277
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
of mutual love and harmony.

278
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,080
I am willing to fight for it.

279
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,760
How do you want to fight?

280
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
I am willing to devote my life for my country.

281
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,880
Yannian, can you tell me,

282
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,520
what do you mean by devotion?

283
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,400
Devotion

284
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,320
means that I am always willing to sacrifice myself for my country.

285
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,880
How can you think of sacrifice at an early age?

286
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,960
Do you have to do this?

287
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,600
Uncle, I think in a country like ours,

288
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,920
there is no other way

289
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
to achieve this ideal.

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,800
I ask you,

291
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
what do you want to do

292
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,920
with your relationship with Liu Mei?

293
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,440
Actually, I have answered you

294
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,880
this question just now.

295
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
You answered me just now??

296
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,480
Then you have to forgive your uncle Liu's stupidity.

297
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
I really don't understand.

298
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,800
I told you just now.

299
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,800
I'm willing to

300
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,080
to dedicate my life for this country and its people.

301
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
So I have no intention of starting a family.

302
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,120
As a follower of anarchism,

303
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
I don't advocate starting a family.

304
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,040
As an anarcho-communist,

305
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,280
I abide by the six No's.

306
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,200
No falling in love. No personal relationships

307
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
is also the proper meaning of it.

308
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,240
Yannian.

309
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,760
There are many people advocating anarchism in China.

310
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,520
But which one is not married?

311
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
Which one doesn't fall in love?

312
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,520
Why do you want to go to this extreme?

313
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
You know, Liu Mei, in order to follow you,

314
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,920
she abandoned everything.

315
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,920
Do you think

316
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
you can afford to do this to her?

317
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,280
Uncle.

318
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,640
I know you came to see me about Liu Mei.

319
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
So I must answer you honestly.

320
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,640
I do so

321
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
also for Liu Mei's happiness.

322
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,640
I do so

323
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
also from our family after so many years of lessons learned

324
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
to make this decision.

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,920
How do you say this?

326
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
My father, Chen Duxiu,

327
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,600
was a man of great ideals,

328
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
a revolutionary who wants to have a family.

329
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
But I think,

330
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
in our disaster-stricken country,

331
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,920
it's impossible to do both.

332
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,880
I can't repeat the same mistakes.

333
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
Your heart is here.

334
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,960
Uncle, didn't you just ask me about my ambition?

335
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
I can give you a definite answer now.

336
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
From small rural areas to cities,

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
I personally felt

338
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,760
the corruption in this country and suffering of the people.

339
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,360
I'm now determined

340
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,200
to sacrifice everything for the strength of the country

341
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,720
and the happiness of the people.

342
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,920
I can't do it both ways like some people do.

343
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,080
So I have to sacrifice myself

344
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,680
without hesitation.

345
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,320
I see.

346
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,960
Sit down.

347
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,080
As an elder, I admire your ambition very much.

348
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,520
And I also firmly believe that

349
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
you will have an extraordinary life.

350
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,480
You and your father are made of special materials.

351
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,920
I'm not.

352
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,760
Liu Mei is my daughter.

353
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
I am responsible for her life.

354
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Do you understand me when I say this?

355
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,200
Understood.

356
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,120
So I don't agree

357
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,000
with her going to France for work-study with you.

358
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,320
She doesn't need work-study now.

359
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,080
Now she needs to be in a famous foreign university

360
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,400
and study peacefully.

361
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,400
Please forgive me.

362
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
There's nothing I can do.

363
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:21,920
Uncle.

364
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,800
Then what else do I need to do?

365
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,880
What you need to do now

366
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,280
is do nothing.

367
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,920
Everything goes with the flow.

368
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,080
Don't hate me either.

369
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,600
Good.

370
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
Come a little closer

371
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,760
Help him with it.

372
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,280
Good.

373
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,960
Look at the camera.

374
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,520
Good.

375
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
Lift a bit of the bride's veil.

376
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,840
I'll do it.

377
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,440
Good. Good.

378
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,120
Yannian, about my dad talking to you,

379
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,480
he told me everything.

380
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
And I know what you think,

381
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
I can't accompany you to France.

382
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know why recently.

383
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,320
Memories keep appearing in my mind

384
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
one after another.

385
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,680
Remember the first time we met?

386
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,360
At the Aurora School.

387
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,640
We had a fight.

388
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,560
It has been more than four years now.

389
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,760
We went from Shanghai to Beijing.

390
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,280
From Beijing to Shanghai.

391
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
I remember we had a frugal canteen together.

392
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,800
Feeding the lambs together.

393
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,080
Making baozi together.

394
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,760
We made live dramas together.

395
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,720
Defeating Wang Jingxuan.

396
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,760
We made puppets together.

397
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,320
Going to prison, handing out leaflets, going to the streets.

398
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,040
I remember everything.

399
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,360
How I want to stay in yesterday!

400
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
But time can't stop.

401
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,040
I wish I didn't want to be here today.

402
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,680
But it's still here today.

403
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
Yannian, do you remember what I told you?

404
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,280
How much I admire you!

405
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,720
You can fly proudly and fly freely,

406
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,920
not relying on family.

407
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,560
I wanted to fly with you.

408
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,640
But today I found out,

409
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
I can't fly high.

410
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
I can't fly out either.

411
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,120
I made a detour.

412
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
I went back to this cage.

413
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,800
Do you remember what I told you?

414
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
Those three words are not in my dictionary.

415
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,240
But you're going to France soon.

416
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't go with you.

417
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,000
I want to say, I'm sorry.

418
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,560
I get it.

419
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,240
I'm ugly, I'm stupid.

420
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
I can't do anything you ask me to do well.

421
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,200
But there is one thing,

422
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,360
I know I can't lie to myself

423
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,920
that I am always

424
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
thinking about you.

425
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,640
I just want to ask,

426
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
on the road of your future life,

427
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,480
am I on it?

428
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay.

429
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,720
I see.

430
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
You're going to France.

431
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,880
I can't see you off.

432
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,560
Take care of yourself and have a safe trip.

433
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm leaving.

434
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,560
"Time flows like water,"

435
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,000
"Soon we shall depart from school,"

436
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,760
"We will ponder for a while"

437
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
"to understand today's homework,"

438
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,360
"Have we ever gone"

439
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,560
"against our teacher?"

440
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,320
"Parents want children to come home,"

441
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,760
"We should not wander on the road"

442
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,680
"of leading the country's future"

443
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
"which depends on our generation,"

444
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,480
"Everybody, work hard!"

445
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,360
"Everybody, work hard!"

446
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
"Classmates!"

447
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,840
"Classmates!"

448
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,760
See you tomorrow.

449
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,240
I'm sorry.

450
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Students, put the boxes in the car first.

451
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,520
Put it here first, put it here first.

452
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
Move someone else's first, move someone else's first.

453
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,080
Our luggage goes last.

454
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,880
Slow down!

455
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,640
Here. Let me help you with your suitcase.

456
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,440
The boys help the girls move.

457
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Put this on that.

458
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,840
Yannian.

459
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,440
Qiaonian.

460
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,200
Put all the luggage in the front.

461
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,960
Here. Here.

462
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,680
I help you.

463
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,280
Thank you, so heavy!

464
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
Everybody, put your luggage in the front.

465
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,280
Okay.

466
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,800
Students quickly put their luggage on the bus.

467
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,840
Qiaonian.

468
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,240
Sister, I'll do it. I'll do it.

469
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,160
Pack the big luggages in the car.

470
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,080
Slow down!

471
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,400
Slow down!

472
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:46,960
It's really heavy.

473
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,840
Your family didn't come.

474
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
I didn't tell them. I don't think they know.

475
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,240
Come, sister.

476
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,360
Give it to me.

477
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
Sideways. Slow down.

478
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,280
Dad.

479
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,800
Dad.

480
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,120
Auntie didn't come.

481
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,640
She didn't. Your auntie is in Beijing.

482
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,560
Not coming is good. Better than crying.

483
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,240
She asked me to bring you something.

484
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,720
Bring what?

485
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,040
Look at it on the ship.

486
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,960
Fried pumpkin seeds. Fried by me.

487
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,800
It's a mess.

488
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,640
It's a mess. It's your style of frying.

489
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm in a bad mood.

490
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,160
Come on, this is enough for you to eat in France.

491
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,360
Come on.

492
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,920
You take this.

493
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:20,960
Take this, take this.

494
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,360
It's ok.

495
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,320
Give me this.

496
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,080
Come on.

497
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,120
Is everyone here?

498
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,880
Time's up.

499
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,160
It's time for us to start.

500
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:18,947
[4 July 1927, Shanghai Longhua Police Headquarters Detention Center]

501
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:41,145
[6 June 1928, Shanghai Longhua Police Headquarters Detention Center]

502
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:40,397
[Chen Yannian, Alternate member of the 5th Central Committee Politburo of the Communist Party of China, revolutionary martyr. Arrested in Shanghai in 1927, he refused to kneel, and was hacked to death by the Kuomintang, aged 29.]

503
00:30:53,464 --> 00:31:06,685
[Chen Qiaonian, Member of the 5th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, revolutionary martyr. Killed by the Kuomintang in Longhua, Shanghai in 1928, aged 26.]

504
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:29,406
[2 Old Yuyangli, Shanghai French Concession]

505
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,280
Recalling the past?

506
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,840
The former residence of Bo Wenwei of the Hunan-Anhui Comrades Association.

507
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
Vigorous.

508
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,240
No one here knows you better than you.

509
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,680
Years of greatness, mountains and rivers remain.

510
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,000
It's hard to be calm.

511
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,760
Brother Xingyan, I would like to thank you for saving me.

512
00:33:47,915 --> 00:33:50,183
[Zhang Shizhao, styled Xingyan]

513
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,240
Otherwise, I would still be in the prison.

514
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,720
Zhongfu, why should we thank each other?

515
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,640
Sit.

516
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,240
Zhongfu, I've already let the word out.

517
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,400
I, Zhang Shizhao, am willing to be Chen Duxiu's

518
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,920
defense attorney for life, for free.

519
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,120
I'm afraid, later on,

520
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,880
there are many places where you'll need me.

521
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,080
What do you mean?

522
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,960
Defense attorney for life, for free.

523
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,120
There are many places where I'll need you.

524
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,120
You mean I may have to go back to prison?

525
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,880
A slip of the tongue.

526
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:35,717
No, no, no!

527
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,720
You don't have to bah.

528
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,800
Maybe your prophecy will come true.

529
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,200
No. In the future, I'll

530
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,960
be in and out of the lab many times.

531
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,160
I hear you now have an obvious tendency

532
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,000
towards Marx and the Russian revolution.

533
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,960
Is it right to transform China

534
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,000
by having a new set of views?

535
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm still exploring.

536
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,680
The Road of October Revolution

537
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,440
really inspired me a lot.

538
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,920
President Meng of Wuhan Cultural College

539
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,840
has heard a lot about you, Chen Duxiu.

540
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,600
He has asked me many times to invite you to give lectures in Hankou.

541
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,920
Look, you just got out of prison.

542
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,440
It's hard to get out again.

543
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Why don't you lecture, like in the past?

544
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,560
Yes, I'd like to go.

545
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,120
What a happy promise!

546
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay, I'll tell you the next thing.

547
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,840
About Southwest University.

548
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
After Mr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Kuomintang,

549
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,120
the Guangdong government strongly advocates ideological and cultural education.

550
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,960
This allowed Chen Jiongming's proposal to establish Southwest University,

551
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,440
which had been in the works for years, to pass.

552
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,120
The military government also dedicated

553
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
one million yuan for the preparation.

554
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,800
This Chen Jiongming adores you

555
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,440
and wants to poach you to go to Guangdong to run his education.

556
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,360
So he let me send you a telegram

557
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,360
and ask you to come here to talk about it.

558
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,200
He is afraid that you will change.

559
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,920
and asked me to bring a retainer fee, and letter of appointment.

560
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,520
Otherwise,

561
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,560
let's go in and hold an engagement ceremony.

562
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,680
You don't even ask me if I want

563
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,480
to do this.

564
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,440
You--

565
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
You don't want to? Why did come to Shanghai?

566
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,000
And I also know that

567
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
you sneaked out.

568
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:26,230
[9 Jiangan Hutong, Beijing]

569
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,760
Coming.

570
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,480
Hello, madam.

571
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,080
Is the gentleman at home?

572
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,200
No.

573
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,120
At the invitation of Mr. Zhang Tuzhao,

574
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,120
he went to Shanghai on business and hasn't come back yet.

575
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,040
I have been ordered to say hello to your husband.

576
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,240
Nothing else.

577
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,520
Excuse me.

578
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,320
Good bye.

579
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,120
Madam, leaving now.

580
00:37:37,378 --> 00:37:39,872
[Wuhan Cultural University Auditorium]

581
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,040
Fellow students.

582
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,040
For more than half a year,

583
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,480
the biggest change in China

584
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,560
is that people's wisdom is flourishing, people's spirit is flourishing,

585
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,400
the people have stood up,

586
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,920
putting forward the requirements of transforming society.

587
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,680
I personally think

588
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,800
this is the greatest achievement of the May Fourth Movement.

589
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,000
Hurrah!

590
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,240
What kind of requirements should social transformation meet?

591
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
Everyone is very concerned about this problem.

592
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,440
I spent 90 days in prison.

593
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,440
I have some different ideas

594
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,120
about this problem.

595
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,000
Today, I will discuss with you

596
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,440
social transformation.

597
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,880
One, break the system of class,

598
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,280
to implement common people's socialism,

599
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,240
such that one should not have vanity.

600
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,680
Two, to abolish the system of succession,

601
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,880
we must practice common labor work

602
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,240
so that the proletarians do not suffer and the proletarians enjoy peace.

603
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,920
Three, to abolish the system of inheritance,

604
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,280
land should not be passed down to private hands

605
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,920
and should belong to society as a whole.

606
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,000
People who don't farm should not have the right to the fields.

607
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,400
This is what Marx said.

608
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,800
To eliminate the system of private property.

609
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,040
Hurrah! Hurrah!

610
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,360
Such social transformation requires us to

611
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,160
establish two beliefs.

612
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,440
That is, the belief in equality and the belief in labor.

613
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,440
Everyone should be educated

614
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,880
and everyone should work often.

615
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,320
Always in mind equal labor in your heart.

616
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,600
and labor revolution.

617
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,280
Today we talk about transforming society,

618
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,920
that is a fundamental transformation of society,

619
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,280
not improvement.

620
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
Fundamental transformation

621
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,120
means that, if necessary,

622
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,720
we must resort to bloody revolution.

623
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,240
Of course, we haven't reached

624
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,520
bloody revolution.

625
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,960
But we always have to have

626
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,960
the means to study the revolution

627
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,600
and the faith to that time when the revolution is possible.

628
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,800
We must fight this devil!

629
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,920
Hurrah!

630
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,320
Hurrah!

631
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,160
Hurrah!

632
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,840
Mr. Chen.

633
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,200
Come.

634
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,920
What's going on?

635
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,720
Mr. Chen, something happened.

636
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,800
We have caused you trouble.

637
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,880
What's the trouble?

638
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
The Wuhan authorities heard that Mr. Chen's

639
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,680
talk is about socialist ideas.

640
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,880
They're appalled.

641
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,800
A circular has been issued.

642
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,720
Mr. Chen is forbidden to speak

643
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
and you will be expelled from Wuhan.

644
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,520
I came to tell you.

645
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,240
Please try to leave Wuhan as soon as possible.

646
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,360
Save yourself from being killed.

647
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,320
I'm Chen. I'm a scholar.

648
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,720
It's been a great honor.

649
00:40:51,840 --> 00:41:01,120
Support Chen Duxiu!

650
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,360
When will Mom come back?

651
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,720
It's been a long time.

652
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,560
Dad will be back soon.

653
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,200
Dad will bring you delicious food when he comes back.

654
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,200
Do you miss your father?

655
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,200
Of course I miss him.

656
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,640
Mom misses Dad, too.

657
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,160
Dad!

658
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,120
Dad!

659
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
How can you speak of the devil?

660
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,160
What delicious food did you bring me, Dad?

661
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,520
Sesame candy.

662
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
How's it going? Have you seen Yannian and them?

663
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,320
Hurry up and slow down.

664
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
Finally, they met before they set off.

665
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,280
That's good.

666
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,880
Come. Come inside.

667
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,280
Brother Zhongfu is at home, right?
