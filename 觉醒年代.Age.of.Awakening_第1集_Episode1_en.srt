1
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:43,171
Zhong Fu What time is it already, you're still not going to sleep?

2
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:46,086
what is there worth seeing outside?

3
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,271
the boat passed Shandong 

4
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:51,543
I feel timidity as I near home

5
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,429
the boat passed Shandong

6
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:57,957
there's anger in my heart I want to scold someone

7
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:00,971
I want to scold Yuan Shikai

8
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,371
I also want to scold this Yuan datou

9
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,600
I don't know what he's thinking

10
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:11,943
he dares to give Qingdao to Japan

11
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:14,600
you say, did this guy take the wrong medicine?

12
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,457
Yuan Shikai did not take the wrong medicine

13
00:21:19,943 --> 00:21:21,600
it's our country 

14
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,586
that is already incurable 

15
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:25,843
why do you say that?

16
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Think about it 

17
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,943
from guangnian, when Lin Zexu forbid opium

18
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:32,471
it's been a whole 75 years already

19
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:34,518
in the middle of this, how many people

20
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:35,900
thought of different ways

21
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,236
but still couldn't save the Great Qing Dynasty

22
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:41,543
Sun Zhongshan introduced the republic from the west

23
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,600
the countrymen all thought this...

24
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:45,214
...was a remedy to save the country and enrich the people

25
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,343
who had thought, the republic works outside...

26
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:50,571
...but in China it's not effective anymore

27
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:52,829
three to four years of the republic later

28
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,443
the country is not as good as it used to be

29
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,771
since there is no cure...

30
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,529
...then isn't taking the old way better

31
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,400
this isn't just the thoughts of one or two people

32
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:03,400
Bai Sha

33
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:04,571
isn't it?

34
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:09,071
right now Liang Shiyi and his group

35
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:11,971
are establishing connections everywhere jumping up and down (?)
