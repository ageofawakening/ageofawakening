1
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,486
Zhong Fu What time is it already, you're still not going to sleep?

2
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,743
What is there worth seeing outside?

3
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,271
The boat passed Shandong 

4
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,543
I feel apprehensive as I near home

5
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,429
The boat passed Shandong

6
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,957
There's anger in my heart I want to scold someone

7
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:00,971
I want to scold Yuan Shikai

8
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,371
I also want to scold this Yuan datou

9
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,371
I don't know what he's thinking

10
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,800
he dared to give Qingdao to Japan

11
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:14,529
You say, did this guy take the wrong medicine?

12
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,457
Yuan Shikai did not take the wrong medicine

13
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
it's our country 

14
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,586
that is already incurable 

15
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:25,843
Why do you say that?

16
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Think about it 

17
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:29,943
from guangnian, when Lin Zexu forbid opium

18
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:32,471
it's been a whole 75 years already

19
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:34,518
in the middle of this, how many people

20
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:35,900
thought of different ways

21
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,236
but still couldn't save the Great Qing Dynasty

22
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:41,400
Sun Zhongshan introduced the republic from the west

23
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:43,557
people of the country all thought that this...

24
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,171
...was a remedy to save the country and enrich the people

25
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:48,343
who would have thought, the republic works in other countries

26
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,514
...but inside of China it does not work anymore

27
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:52,700
three to four years of the republic later

28
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:55,414
the country is not as good as it used to be

29
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,771
since there is no cure...

30
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,614
...then isn't taking the old way better

31
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,257
these aren't just the thoughts of one or two people,

32
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:03,357
Bai Sha

33
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,529
Isn't it?

34
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:08,900
Right now Liang Shiyi and his group

35
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:11,971
are establishing connections everywhere jumping up and down (?)

36
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:15,400
joining Yang Hu Gong Yan Ji Dao

37
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,829
...and helping a villain blindly create disturbances

38
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,686
Unreasonable 

39
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,729
Yang Du Yan Fu 

40
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:28,043
(idiom) they are the wisest who can have a momentary lapse in judgement

41
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:30,843
whereas that Liang Shiyi group

42
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,771
are political hooligans with no moral bottom line

43
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,829
I made up a name for them

44
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,171
called "courtesy"

45
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,100
Li Yi Lian, what does it mean?

46
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,529
Courtesy: shameless

47
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,714
Extremely shameless Especially shameless

48
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,857
Good! What a good courtesy!

49
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:58,543
Zhong Fu, your thinking is clearly unusual

50
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,757
Bai Shao I'm ashamed

51
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:07,114
it's been more than ten years

52
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:09,714
Chen Duxiu first learned Kang Liang

53
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:11,357
followed by Zhong Shan 

54
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,300
committed to the political revolution

55
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,657
running this way and that way escaping death many times

56
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,743
guang Japan went 5 times

57
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:19,214
the results until now...

58
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:20,957
they still haven't gone anywhere right?

59
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:23,014
China's matters

60
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:24,471
by relying on political revolution

61
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,800
doesn't solve the fundamental problem

62
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,400
To get to the bottom of this, we must change our way of thinking

63
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,929
Do you have any new ideas?

64
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,457
I don't dare to say my new ideas

65
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:35,800
On my return this time

66
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:37,857
I've made up my mind

67
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,057
For 20 years, I'm not going to touch politics

68
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:43,657
If you're not going to touch politics, then what do you want to do?

69
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:48,086
Transform myself. Replace the person, replace the brain

70
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:49,729
It's not early anymore 

71
00:23:50,957 --> 00:23:52,129
Hurry up and go to sleep
