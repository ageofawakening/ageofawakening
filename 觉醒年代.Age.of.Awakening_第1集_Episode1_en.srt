1
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,486
Zhong Fu What time is it already, you're still not going to sleep?

2
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,743
What is there worth seeing outside?

3
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,271
The boat passed Shandong 

4
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,543
I feel apprehensive as I near home

5
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,429
The boat passed Shandong

6
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,957
There's anger in my heart I want to scold someone

7
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:00,971
I want to scold Yuan Shikai

8
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,371
I also want to scold this Yuan datou

9
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,371
I don't know what he's thinking

10
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,800
he dared to give Qingdao to Japan

11
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:14,529
You say, did this guy take the wrong medicine?

12
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,457
Yuan Shikai did not take the wrong medicine

13
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
it's our country 

14
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,586
that is already incurable 

15
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:25,843
Why do you say that?

16
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Think about it 

17
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:29,943
from guangnian, when Lin Zexu forbid opium

18
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:32,471
it's been a whole 75 years already

19
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:34,518
in the middle of this, how many people

20
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:35,900
thought of different ways

21
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,236
but still couldn't save the Great Qing Dynasty

22
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:41,400
Sun Zhongshan introduced the republic from the west

23
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:43,557
people of the country all thought that this...

24
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,171
...was a remedy to save the country and enrich the people

25
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:48,343
who would have thought, the republic works in other countries

26
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,514
...but inside of China it does not work anymore

27
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:52,700
three to four years of the republic later

28
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:55,414
the country is not as good as it used to be

29
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,771
since there is no cure...

30
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,614
...then isn't taking the old way better

31
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,257
these aren't just the thoughts of one or two people,

32
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:03,357
Bai Sha

33
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,529
Isn't it?

34
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:08,900
Right now Liang Shiyi and his group

35
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:11,971
are establishing connections everywhere jumping up and down (?)

36
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:15,400
joining Yang Hu Gong Yan Ji Dao

37
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,829
...and helping a villain blindly create disturbances

38
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,686
Unreasonable 

39
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,729
Yang Du Yan Fu 

40
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:28,043
(idiom) they are the wisest who can have a momentary lapse in judgement

41
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:30,843
whereas that Liang Shiyi group

42
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,771
are political hooligans with no moral bottom line

43
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,829
I made up a name for them

44
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,171
called "courtesy"

45
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,100
Li Yi Lian, what does it mean?

46
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,529
Courtesy: shameless

47
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,714
Extremely shameless Especially shameless

48
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,857
Good! What a good courtesy!

49
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:58,543
Zhong Fu, your thinking is clearly unusual

50
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,757
Bai Sha I'm ashamed

51
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:07,114
it's been more than ten years

52
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:09,714
Chen Duxiu first learned Kang Liang

53
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:11,357
followed by Zhong Shan 

54
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,300
committed to the political revolution

55
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,657
running this way and that way escaping death many times

56
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,743
guang Japan went 5 times

57
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:19,171
the results until now...

58
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:20,957
they still haven't achieved anything right?

59
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:23,014
China's matters

60
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:24,471
by relying on political revolution

61
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,800
doesn't solve the fundamental problem

62
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,400
To get to the bottom of this, we must change our way of thinking

63
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,929
Do you have any new ideas?

64
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,457
I don't dare to say my new ideas

65
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:35,800
On my return this time

66
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:37,857
I've made up my mind

67
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,057
For 20 years, I'm not going to touch politics

68
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:43,657
If you're not going to touch politics, then what do you want to do?

69
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:48,086
Transform myself. Replace the person, replace the brain

70
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:49,729
It's not early anymore 

71
00:23:50,957 --> 00:23:51,971
Hurry up and go to sleep

72
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,514
 Zhong Fu what time is it already?

73
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:58,000
What are you still sitting there for?

74
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,271
it's so dark out there

75
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:00,343
you can't see anything at all

76
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:10,300
Sleep. Turn off the lights, okay?

77
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:14,700
I do see 

78
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:16,100
We students

79
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:19,986

hui you qi shi

95
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:07,257
Brother Feng Zai, I say, you are really capable

96
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:09,057
things are prepared so well

97
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:10,671
This mahjong game, I really love playing 

98
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:12,171
I also love playing

99
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:15,714
Brother Feng Zai, you are truly wise and brilliant

100
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:18,786
you unexpectedly got everyone ship tickets for a second class cabin

101
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,143
At the fourth class cabin, we

102
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:21,114
were laughing together with the poor

103
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:23,057
That was so boring!

104
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:25,100
Right! So boring 

105
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,300
All of this doesn't mean much

106
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,029
My second uncle said

107
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:30,571
Yuan Shikai wants to become an emperor

108
00:25:30,657 --> 00:25:31,929
He's the chief of Danei (?)

109
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:34,357
once all of you return help give a little more propaganda (?) 

110
00:25:34,657 --> 00:25:35,929
In the future, I will surely not treat everyone unfairly

111
00:25:36,557 --> 00:25:37,800
No problem!

112
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:38,843
Xi Feng

113
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,257
I say, brother Feng Zai

114
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:41,900
ge ji ge ke wei le yuan shikai

115
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:44,157
zhe chuguo liuxue de minge dou bu yao le

116
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:48,886
zen me zhao ni de gen er shu niandaoniandao bu shi

117
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:50,000
I say

118
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:52,157
do all of you have this doubt?

119
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,300
Of course

120
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:55,857
Okay!

121
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:58,500
Then let me help you all dispel these doubts

122
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:00,743
My second uncle says

123
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,586
as long as work is done

124
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:04,629
we can all go to study at Peking university

125
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:05,120
Are you serious?

126
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,611
Then we will have boundless prospects 

127
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:09,300
This is great! Peking University!

128
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:11,300
I was waiting for this sentence from you!

129
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:40,843
Zhong Fu

130
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:42,200
Somebody made way for you

131
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:43,457
why did you not acknowledge them

132
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,071
this is unreasonable 

133
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,514
Who is this person?

134
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:51,114
He is the famous senior from Tongmenghui (Sun Yat Sen's alliance for democracy)

135
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:54,014
General Yu Yongcheng, commander of the Third army of Xiangyu coalition 

136
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:55,343
You need to give him an apology

137
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:58,071
I've always been uninterested in bureaucrats

138
00:26:58,257 --> 00:26:59,786
Look at you!

139
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,458
Greetings Mr. Bai Sha

140
00:27:07,614 --> 00:27:08,300
Greetings General Yu

141
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:10,729
Mr. Zhong Fu

142
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:12,543
General Yu isn't an ordinary official

143
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,657
In the second year or the Republic, Song Jiaoren was killed

144
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:17,371
General Yu deeply felt that the Republic would fall apart 

145
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,214
Leave a poem of death (?)

146
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:21,514
Jump into the Huangpu River in anger and commit suicide 

147
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:23,586
Blast through the revolution for 10 more years

148
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:24,871
Expel Huhu's ancestral whip (?)

149
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:27,214
unexpectedly Yuan monkey's tumble out (?)

150
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:28,771
I die when the Republic succeeds 

151
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,057
How magnificent 

152
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:34,414
Not really, I (humble) am incompetent 

153
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,429
Jumping into Huangpu River to commit suicide

154
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:39,271
Unsuccessful (?)

155
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:42,700
Indeed, it was an attempt

156
00:27:42,886 --> 00:27:45,386
rescued by fishermen (?)

157
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:46,514
If so

158
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,929
I actually think you are a muddled person

159
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:51,957
How can a revolutionary kill himself so easily

160
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:53,957
I, Chen DuXiu, this life

161
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:58,857
will never be a conscious fool of the revolution (?)

162
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:03,386
Zhong Fu!

163
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:05,271
General Yu I apologize

164
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:06,271
It's alright

165
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:09,614
Zhong Fu!

166
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,386
Zhong Fu!

167
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:13,386
You were too overbearing

168
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,771
Being ruthless does not make you a true hero 

169
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:15,957
Maybe one day

170
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:16,700
I will also be like Qu Yuan

171
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:17,529
jumping into a river to commit suicide

172
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,986
At that time, will you also come ridicule me?

173
00:28:24,957 --> 00:28:25,929
Sorry, Bai Sha

174
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:30,729
I'm not in a good mood, I forgot my manners

175
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:32,243
Forgive me

176
00:28:41,014 --> 00:28:43,300
jun man ke xue le

177
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:45,414
At a young age, you can get tuberculosis (?)

178
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:47,814
Yan Nian, Qiao Nian, those two unfilial sons

179
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:48,986
bu zai jia shi mu

180
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:51,200
and recently ran to Shanghai

181
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,057
Pity her, she is both an aunt and a stepmother (?)

182
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:55,900
sick and has no money

183
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,171
one family with 5 to 6 mouths

184
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:00,086
I really don't know

185
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,986
how they should live (?)

186
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,686
You.. This way of managing the family is worthy of discussion (?)

187
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:06,829
I heard you insist on not giving

188
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:08,929
living expenses to the two brothers Yan Nian and Qiao Nian

189
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:09,886
but let them work while studying 

190
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:10,986
provide for themselves 

191
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,086
At a young age

192
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:15,443
who can take this kind of suffering

193
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,243
Why can't they take this kind of suffering?

194
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,514
If I had money I still wouldn't give it

195
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:26,357
Besides, I don't have money 

196
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:29,100
Shanghai French Concession Port (?)

197
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:30,200
Be careful brother! (?)

198
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:30,829
Here

199
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:39,814
Chen Yannian, Chen Duxiu's eldest son

200
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:49,100
Chen Qiaonian, Chen Duxiu's second son

201
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:51,786
Here

202
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:54,114
This

203
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:59,057
Gloomy men lets sing a tune     Heiyo! (?)

204
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:03,586
Gloomy women come snivel     Heiyo! (?)

205
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:06,300
If there's any matter, then sing!

206
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,214
You old thing!

207
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,471
This old thing!

208
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:23,029
You can't even carry one bag, you still want to carry two?

209
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:23,929
Spilling beans all over the ground

210
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:25,186
You idler!

211
00:30:25,386 --> 00:30:27,257
If you can then do it. If you can't then get out of here!

212
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:29,286
I'll beat you to death! Let you be an idler

213
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:31,457
Let you be an idler! Let you...

214
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:32,400
Still hitting?

215
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:33,071
What are you doing!

216
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:33,643
Don't move!

217
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:34,671
Don't move!     What are you doing!

218
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,700
What do you want!

219
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:36,557
For what reason are you hitting someone?

220
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,429
Are you okay?

221
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:38,400
For what reason...

222
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:40,149
Because I'm in charge here!

223
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,657
Hey! How come it's you again?

224
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:44,114
Did you want to take the whipping for him? 

225
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,914
Get out of here for me!

226
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,871
His leg already had an injury

227
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,943
What's wrong if the things fell on the ground?

228
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,114
Isn't it fine if it's picked up

229
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:49,714
What the fuck does his injury have to do with me! (?)

230
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,029
You have to take responsibility for delaying business!

231
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,243
But you still can't beat someone up! 

232
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,880
 I just did. What about it? (?)

233
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,411
Believe it or not I'll beat both of you together

234
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:01,529
Don't hit!

235
00:31:01,686 --> 00:31:02,400
You can't fight!

236
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:03,143
Want to rebel, is that right?

237
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,229
Want to rebel, is that right!

238
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,414
You are quite a righteous brat, huh

239
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,063
Fine, today I'll let you handle the first matter (?)

240
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:10,857
Old Jia's life, you take care of

241
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:12,103
All of you can't get involved

242
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,349
Whoever comes out will do it (?)

243
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:13,989
Come

244
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:15,394
I'll do it

245
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:15,954
Me too

246
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,686
Count me in!

247
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:19,646
Since you two volunteered, you two do it

248
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:20,643
Come

249
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:21,929
No more nonsense!

250
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,914
Come

251
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:27,051
hao gai shei le. Break it up

252
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,560
What are you still looking at? Scatter 

253
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,171
Turn over these two

254
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,286
It's nothing, all of you go to work (?)

255
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:30,829
Grab here

256
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:35,234
Okay

257
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:41,086
Here!

258
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:42,583
shang

259
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:46,257
shang

260
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:51,200
All right all right. Go do your job

261
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:52,571
What are you being distracted for!

262
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:53,886
Pick up those beans cleanly for me

263
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:55,349
If you miss even one grain, I'll kill you

264
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:56,720
Quickly

265
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:57,686
Hurry up

266
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:01,742
Older brother

267
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:03,129
I can't hold on anymore

268
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,471
Hurry and put it down! Don't injure your waist

269
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:06,571
That's not it, my waistband broke

270
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:11,977
Well then..

271
00:32:12,543 --> 00:32:13,406
Put your legs together

272
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:17,129
Don't move, alright

273
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,646
What are you dillydallying for? Quickly

274
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,014
Take your legs out

275
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:27,086
Put on your shoes 

276
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:29,394
You don't even want your shoes on now, huh?

277
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,766
Let go Let go

278
00:32:44,966 --> 00:32:45,600
Let go of me

279
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,400
What's going on!

280
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:47,615
What are you doing?

281
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:48,811
Let go of me!

282
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:49,669
You guys can't be like this!

283
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,417
Stop right now! What do you guys want to do!

284
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,166
Let go. Let go of me

285
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:54,257
Get your hands off of me!

286
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:54,960
What are you guys doing!

287
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,657
You can't be like this!

288
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:56,263
Let go of me!

289
00:32:57,829 --> 00:32:58,357
What are you doing

290
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:08,406


291
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,143
That's a girl!

292
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:03,703
What are you doing

293
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:05,931
Let go Let go

294
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,611
Hands off   Take your hands off right now

295
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:13,357
What the hell is going on today?

296
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,636
bang da yuanyang haishang xi xiang

297
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:15,514
Let me go!

298
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:22,857
Out of the way

299
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:23,726
Stop fighting

300
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:26,834
Who!

301
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:28,171
Who did it

302
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:29,229
Who did it

303
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:30,994
Who threw it

304
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,406
What are you guys doing?

305
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:35,360
Do you want to steal money or jump into the sea and run away

306
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,588
Our boat tickets were stolen

307
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,149
cai dao jiaban shanglai de 

308
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:39,157
Don't hit

309
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:39,874
Just forget it

310
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:40,880
Let go

311
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,600
Just forget it

312
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:51,669
Stop fighting

313
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:58,571
Stop fighting

314
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:11,040
Good!

315
00:34:11,086 --> 00:34:12,014
Stop the ruckus 

316
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:13,132
It's forbidden to make a ruckus here

317
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:14,492
We are on the ocean

318
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:16,286
This boat belongs to Japan (?)

319
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:22,149
People who don't have a boat ticket must buy one

320
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:24,686
So, everyone don't misunderstand 

321
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:27,214
We conducted an investigation in secret

322
00:34:27,229 --> 00:34:31,589
and found out that those two originally did not have boat tickets

323
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:32,777
therefore

324
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:36,446
these two must buy boat tickets

325
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:39,189
Let these two youths off

326
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,063
The boat tickets, I'll pay for

327
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,529
Okay as long as the tickets are purchased, it's fine

328
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:46,583
It's not okay! You guys...

329
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,206
You have to apologize to these two Chinese youngsters

330
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:49,329
This is the ship of the Japanese (?)

331
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,537
we are carrying out official business

332
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:52,443
There is no reason to apologize, you guys better not go too far

333
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:54,594
Is beating people carrying out official business? 

334
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:56,892
Is humiliating a woman carrying out official business?

335
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,914
Is taking off a girl's clothes carrying out official business?

336
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:00,069
I'm telling you guys...

337
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:02,251
you Japanese people are abusing your power

338
00:35:02,252 --> 00:35:03,783
wantonly insulting us Chinese people

339
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:05,292
jiu shi dui wo men zhong guo de wuru

340
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:06,674
This is the high seas (?)

341
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:07,634
zhe shi yi jian

342
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:09,623
a big matter that is enough to cause international dispute (?)

343
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:10,594
ni men fei yao

344
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:12,257
messing around until this matter gets out of hand?

345
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:14,366
Apologize!

346
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,372
Apologize!

347
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,029
Apologize!   Apologize!

348
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:18,606
Apologize!

349
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:19,829
Apologize!

350
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:23,166
Apologize!  Apologize! 

351
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:27,246
Apologize!  Apologize!  Apologize!  Bad guys, apologize!

352
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,937
Apologize!   Apologize! 

353
00:35:28,938 --> 00:35:30,034
Apologize!   Apologize! 

354
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:31,931
Apologize!   Apologize! 

355
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:35,931
Okay! I got it

356
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,640
You two quickly apologize

357
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,114
Sorry   Sorry

358
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:45,760
Hey Let's go

359
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:48,514
We won!

360
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,840
We won!

361
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
We won!

362
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:55,471
This is called victory?  What was the victory?

363
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,109
The three words "I am sorry", and it's over?

364
00:35:57,309 --> 00:35:58,183
That's right!

365
00:35:58,184 --> 00:35:59,200
Does this count as victory?

366
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:00,926
jiezhe da bei

367
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:02,300
huilai jiezhe da

368
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:03,623
What are you saying!

369
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:04,754
Are you still human?

370
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:06,251
Seeing your fellow citizen being bullied...

371
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:07,189
not coming out to lend a hand...

372
00:36:07,257 --> 00:36:08,492
instead, you are on the side making sarcastic remarks

373
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:09,474
Are you still a Chinese person? (?)

374
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:11,280
Do still know what is shame? (?)

00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:21,646
Exterminate the Eight-Nation Alliance 

379
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:22,354
That's right!

380
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:23,177
That's what is called ability

381
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:23,646
You!

382
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:25,051
What do you want to do?

00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:26,514
A Chinese people fighting each other

384
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:27,692

387
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:32,869
Come

388
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:35,714
Do you see it?

389
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:37,383
Chinese people are bullying each other!

390
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,800

All of you go back

00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:04,869
Little... Little chick it seems like

401
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:13,280
This eyesight of yours is not good

402
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:16,514
It's one pastry (?)

403
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,366
Play often (?)

404
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:21,714
Why did you throw the tile!

405
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:23,623
Fellow citizens being insulted

You guys still want to lose face (?)

Us Chinese people arguing amongst ourselves here...

419
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:48,983
We let the foreigners see a joke

420
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,692
Everyone else, go back to your cabin. Right now

421
00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:52,629

We are all Chinese people

435
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:16,386
Helping each other is what we should do

436
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:17,669

00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,354
Don't eat this anymore

470
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:06,069

474
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:17,948
Aunt is not an outsider

475
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,200
What is it that you can't eat

476
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:24,960

Yannian.  Come, eat some buns

483
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,994
Aunt, money is used to buy this

484
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,851
When you look at it, it doesn't look good. Once you eat it, it's quite flavorful

485
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:00,629
Where's Henian

486
00:42:01,743 --> 00:42:02,629
He's not feeling very well

487
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:04,194
I had a neighbour help look after him

488
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,303
Yannian Qiaonian

489
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:09,714
Aunt has come here many times to urge you guys...

490
00:42:10,714 --> 00:42:12,560
You guys are always stubbornly not willing to come home with me

491
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:13,920
Your father is about to come back

492
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:15,463
Come home with aunt

493
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:18,069
We won't go back

494
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:19,646
We don't have anything to do with this person

495
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:23,680
But you guys working outside like this...

496
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,749
is truly a lot of hardship

Good and bad, you can eat something hot (?)

500
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,055
Okay?

501
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:34,079
Aunt, don't try to persuade us anymore

502
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:35,611
We will rely on ourselves

503
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:37,314
This is our principle

504
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:39,383
Zimei

505
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:41,360
Your brothers are going to go to work

506
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:42,389
This time we can't accompany you to play

507
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:43,634

Take these all of these buns

513
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:57,166
Older brother, you agreed that I would send my grasshopper (?)

514
00:42:57,529 --> 00:42:58,697
Brother promised you, I will do it for sure
