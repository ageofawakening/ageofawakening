00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,120
Who are they taking?

189
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
On the list is Guo Xingang, a liberal arts student,

190
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,400
Deng Zhongxia, and so on.

191
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,280
There seems to be Li Dazhao.

192
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,040
Outrageous.

193
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
Inform the doorman to close the school gate.

194
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,280
Never let the Queue Army's cavalry to rush into the campus.

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
You get my car ready.

196
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Yes.

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,240
Master Cai, don't get excited.

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
I expected this Zhang Xun Restoration

199
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,240
was a farce

200
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,280
and would not achieve anything.

201
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
We'd better wait and see.

202
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,760
Zhongfu. Now, Peking University has become

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,120
the benchmark of New Culture.

204
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
In the face of this major issue of principle,

205
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,600
we must make our position clear to him.

206
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
I am going to resign.

207
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
I am going to protest.

208
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,840
I am going to the Ministry of Education!

209
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,080
What are you going to do in the Ministry of Education at this time?

210
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,920
Zhongfu. Politics is within the university's interests.

211
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,040
Since the Queue Army is destined to be short-lived,

212
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,280
I will make a big fuss about it.

213
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,440
Isn't it good to contribute to our new Peking University?

214
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,160
Or you, you sly old rabbit. Admirable.

215
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
I see. Mr. Zhao.

216
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,080
You go with Mister,

217
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,960
the road is not safe.

218
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,520
Yes.

219
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
No, I can go alone.

220
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
The key is

221
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,200
to let Li Dazhao leave quickly and avoid it.

222
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Rest assured, Shouchang has left Beijing

223
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,600
to go to Shanghai.

224
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,560
Excellent.

225
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
I'm leaving. Go.

226
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:13,122
[Zhou Shuren (Lu Xun), styled Yucai, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

227
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
Master Cai.

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,200
You are here.

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
Yucai, what are you doing here?

230
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
I want to make a statement.

231
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
In case in the future,

232
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
they say I am in cahoots with Zhang Xun.

233
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,600
Alright.

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
I told you that you wouldn't let yourself fall behind.

235
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,320
Come to Peking University to teach.

236
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
The New Culture Movement advocated by Peking University

237
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,240
also needs your talents to participate in it.

238
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,320
I listen to Master Cai.

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Just go back.

240
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,400
Don't stay here too long now that your position is clear.

241
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,360
I have another very important thing

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,880
to ask you.

243
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
You have time.

244
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Come to my place sometime.

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,200
Alright.

246
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,200
Master Cai.

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
How many business trips are you here for in this war-torn place?

248
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
The same as you.

249
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,120
Look, Jiemin will be here soon.

250
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
Minister Fan. President Cai Yuanpei has arrived.

251
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,640
Show him in.

252
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,840
You see.

253
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,800
President Cai. Please.

254
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,080
You.

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,480
What's so funny?

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320
Why are you laughing?

257
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,920
When the current situation develops like this,

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,040
you can still laugh.

259
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
Brother Jiemin, I'm laughing at Brother Botang.

260
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,520
He brought me good tea early in the morning,

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
said that Cai Jiemin would come later to hand in his resignation.

262
00:10:55,248 --> 00:11:00,279
[Fan Yuanlian, styled Jingsheng, Minister of Education]

263
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
Let me wait for the tea.

264
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,000
I, uh, came to ask Brother Botang for advice.

265
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:06,237
[Wang Daxie, styled Botang, Diplomat of the Beiyang government]

266
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,080
What did you say is going on?

267
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
How did the city of Beijing

268
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
become the Queue Army's territory overnight?

269
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,840
What a farce.

270
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
This pro-Japanese Duan Qirui wants to send troops to Europe.

271
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
And Li Yuanhong

272
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
is not willing to let Duan Qirui exercise dictatorship.

273
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
As expected,

274
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
it is said that Li Yuanhong fell for Zhang Xun's ploy.

275
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
Zhang Xun was taken in by Duan Qirui.

276
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,640
What makes you say that?

277
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,160
Li Yuanhong asked Zhang Xun to coordinate the Li-Duan dispute,

278
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
which led to the wolf entering the room.

279
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,800
Zhang Xun was encouraged by Duan Qirui

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,520
to let Li Yuantong resign and let little Xuantong restore the throne.

281
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
The result is widespread indignation and discontent, that will be defamed throughout history.

282
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
Brother Botang, tell me about it.

283
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
How will this situation develop now?

284
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
Now the whole country is denouncing Zhang Xun.

285
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,960
In Tianjin, Duan Qirui

286
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,680
has issued a campaign against rebellion.

287
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,120
And organized a rebel army

288
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,720
to attack the capital.

289
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,560
Zhang Xun's five-thousand-strong Queue Army

290
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,400
collapsed at the first blow!

291
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,520
In the end, Duan Qirui will definitely make a comeback.

292
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,080
He defeated Zhang Xun

293
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,840
and drove out Li Yuanhong

294
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,560
and gained a reputation for defending the Republic.

295
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
This... This is killing three birds with one stone.

296
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,800
If that's the case,

297
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,000
then how should we live with ourselves?

298
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,240
I and Jingsheng can quietly

299
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
watch how the current situation will evolve.

300
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
And you?

301
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,280
You must leave Beijing as soon as possible.

302
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,720
Flee and hide.

303
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,051
Why?

304
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:40,969
Why?

305
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,520
Why do you have to make me flee and hide?

306
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
Peking University is the first of the new ideological trend.

307
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,000
Once the war starts,

308
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
we should prevent the Queue Clique from jumping over the wall

309
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,600
and taking Peking University.

310
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
You ran away.

311
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
Then you have nothing to do with Peking University and Zhang Xun.

312
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,920
In the future, it will be a bargaining chip for you with Duan Qirui.

313
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,360
Smart, extremely smart.

314
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,080
Okay, okay, I'll listen to you.

315
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
I'll go back to the school and make arrangements.

316
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,960
How about this.

317
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm going to Tianjin to hide tonight.

318
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,360
Good.

319
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,520
That will do, Brother Jiemin.

320
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,120
You took your props (?)

321
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
and went around my Ministry of Education. (?)

322
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,800
You've got a good hand.

323
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,000
To say high, you're taller than him. (?)

324
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,840
Come.

325
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
I hope this farce will end soon

326
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,280
so that you and I can have peace of mind.

327
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,806
Zhongfu!

328
00:13:58,529 --> 00:13:59,514
Zhongfu!

329
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,120
Junman, don't be afraid.

330
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
Did you hear it?

331
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
What's going on? What was...

332
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,040
What happened?

333
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,880
It seems that Duan Qirui's rebel army

334
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
is fighting Zhang Xun's Queue Army,

335
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,640
which is far from us.

336
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,720
Will they fire cannons?

337
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
They won't.

338
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,600
Neither Duan Qirui nor Zhang Xun dared

339
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,040
to open fire at Beijing.

340
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,320
Don't worry. It's nothing.

341
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,400
You said they wouldn't fire cannons.

342
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,520
What is this?

343
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,000
It may be that the rebel army is bombing the city gate with explosives.

344
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
Why are you so sure it wasn't cannons?

345
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,240
I made explosives with Cai Jiemin.

346
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,600
That's the sound.

347
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,760
Do you think Shanghai will fight?

348
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,280
Will Yannian and Qiaonian be all right?

349
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,120
Shanghai will not fight.

350
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
A few days at most.

351
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,200
Rest assured.

352
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
I have asked someone to bring a message to Wang Mengzou.

353
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
asking him to take care of Yannian and Qiaonian.

354
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,200
Dad, I'm scared!

355
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,000


356
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,080


357
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,680


358
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,200


359
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,520


360
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,640


361
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,280


362
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,920


363
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,160


364
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,280


365
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,720

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,560


368
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,640


369
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,040


370
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,360


371
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:11,440


372
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:11,760


373
