00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
like the two of you.

441
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
Come, sit.

442
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
Mr. Shouchang, let's move to the drawing room.

443
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,720
No need. It's fine here.

444
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,680
Then sit here, please.

445
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,440
It's no bother, Mr. Wang.

446
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,320
Sit here.

447
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,160
I'm ashamed to be here this time.

448
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,640
Running off in a panic, in dire straits.

449
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Brother Zhongfu brought word

450
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
that I must come to the Yadong Library.

451
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,360
First, to let everyone know we are safe.

452
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,080
Second, to investigate "New Youth"'s

453
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,720
operational condition.

454
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
Third, to make some new friends.

455
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.

456
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,520
Not at all, not at all.

457
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,560
How is Zhongfu?

458
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,040
Your father is very busy person right now.

459
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,440
He is helping Mr. Cai with reforms at Peking University,

460
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,360
which are going swimmingly.

461
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,040
Running "New Youth",

462
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,480
advocating for the New Culture movement,

463
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,480
it's all very impressive.

464
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
It's only that the current political situation is difficult.

465
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,880
Every step forward is challenging.

466
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,680
To be able to move a bit every day, like a pawn, is productive enough.

467
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,080
Mr. Shouchang,

468
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,920
does this Zhang Xun Restoration

469
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,160
affect the reforms at Peking University?

470
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,320
The new zeitgeist of reform at Peking University

471
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,720
is definitely intolerable for the likes of Zhang Xun.

472
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,800
But at the moment it looks like

473
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,040
the restoration will come to a premature end.

474
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,800
As for the situation in the future,

475
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,160
it depends.

476
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,000
Then what do you think about the present state of affairs?

477
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
I think the situation is not encouraging.

478
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,360
Brother Zhongfu once said

479
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,520
that after Yuan Shikai

480
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
there is bound to be a period of fighting between warlords.

481
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,720
And now everyone can see.

482
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
Europe has gone to war.

483
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
The world is a mess.

484
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,560
China is poor and weak.

485
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Fragmented and disorganized like a heap of sand.

486
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,680
With internal trouble and external aggression, it is hard to be independent.

487
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
If China is like this, what is the way forward?

488
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
The Zhang Xun Restoration

489
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
broke the hearts of many people.

490
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
No hint in sight for which course to follow

491
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
to get out of the predicament.

492
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,720
But none of us have given up.

493
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,080
Then from what you can tell,

494
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,360
do you think the theory of anarchism

495
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,120
can help China?

496
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,040
I don't think so.

497
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,440
I've read anarchist books.

498
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,680
This theory seems to hold a lot of attraction.

499
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,120
But very utopian.

500
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm afraid it won't work in practice.

501
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
I think Kropotkin's Mutual Aid

502
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,040
can solve China's problems.

503
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,640
Moreover, it is the only way out.

504
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,080
Yannian,

505
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,080
do you see a single country in Europe

506
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
forming its state policy in accordance with the doctrine of mutual aid?

507
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,760
You're still young now.

508
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,520
At this time,

509
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,160
there is no harm in reading widely, listeningly widely.

510
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,600
In considering problems and thinking things through, don't go to the extremes.

511
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,160
Mr. Shouchang is right.

512
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Do you have any plans for this visit to Shanghai?

513
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,280
I plan to use this time

514
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
to properly sort out my own thoughts

515
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,120
and reflect on some questions.

516
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,680
I also want to spend some time amongst the people.

517
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,240
I want to see the real China,

518
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
what it's actually like.

519
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,280
Mr. Li.

520
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,240
Hello.

521
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,520
Mengzou,

522
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
the table has been set, and the wine has been warmed.

523
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,760
Invite everyone to take their seats.

524
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
Then why don't we talk while we eat.

525
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,480
Mr. Wang, after you.

526
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,160
This way, please.

527
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,920
Qiaonian,

528
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,640
Yannian.

529
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
Thank you. Let's go!

530
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:54,443
[Beijing]

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,040
Extra! Extra!

532
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
Emperor Xuantong has abdicated again.

533
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,000
Zhang Xun has fled to the Dutch embassy.

534
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,680
Li Yuanhong has resigned.

535
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
Feng Guozhang is the acting president.

536
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,440
Republican hero Duan Qirui returned to the capital.

537
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,612
Extra! Extra!

538
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:11,286
Extra! Extra!

539
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,120
Emperor Xuantong has abdicated again.

540
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,760
Zhang Xun has fled to the Dutch embassy.

541
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,600
Li Yuanhong has resigned.

542
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
Feng Guozhang is the acting president.

543
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,640
Republican hero Duan Qirui returned to the capital.

544
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
Extra! Extra!

545
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
Emperor Xuantong has abdicated again.

546
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,720
Take it back. Even half price will do.

547
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,360
Just bought it yesterday.

548
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:32,325
Scammer!

549
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
He's abdicated!

550
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,800
Emperor Xuantong has abdicated!

551
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
Zhang Xun has fled!

552
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,800
Hear ye! Hear ye! Listen up.

553
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,800
Hot off the press.

554
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,800
Queue-wearing army comes to Beijing

555
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,800
Then the commotion of taking the throne

556
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
People adding to the ruckus

557
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
Just to make a buck of their own.

558
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,160
Old brother,

559
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,840
I say there's no need to pick it up.

560
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
Save it. Who knows? It might be useful again.

561
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Feng Guozhang is the acting president.

562
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,520
Republican hero Duan Qirui returned to the capital.

563
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:31,440
"Warhorses keep roaring on and on"

564
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,440
"Gods and demons fear the Green Dragon Crescent Blade"

565
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,280
"Now with orders to march north of the river"

566
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,480
"We will clash swords with Cao Cao"

567
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:57,040
"The warhorses shall be quartered at the Han Ford" (Shao opera)

568
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,280
Ah yikes!

569
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,200
Brother Jiemin,

570
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,800
you are so elegant.

571
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,520
Your exemplary reputation is being undermined.

572
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
I am truly sorry.

573
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,040
For shame! For shame!

574
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
Come, please. Please sit.

575
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,760
Please sit.

576
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,680
It truly...

577
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
It truly is not elegant. It truly is not.

578
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,200
Master Cai,

579
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,000
come.

580
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,880
What is this?

581
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,080
First, your resignation letter.

582
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
Returned as is.

583
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,680
Second, a commendation seal for you from Duan Qirui

584
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
and an order that increases Peking University's funds.

585
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,960
Third, agreement from the education ministry with Peking University's reforms.

586
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,320
And wholesale approval of the professor recruitment plan.

587
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,720
Master Cai, this is a big prize.

588
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,280
Didn't expect Zhang Xun's queue-wearing army

589
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,800
would provide such additional assistance to Peking University.

590
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,480
For Peking University, this has been a blessing in disguise.

591
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,320
A silver lining indeed.

592
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,720
The current political situation is tumultuous.

593
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,560
All these political bigwigs

594
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,320
now want to use you, Cai Yuanpei,

595
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,680
and Peking University to keep up appearances.

596
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,800
You are now the belle of the ball.

597
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,280
It's true.

598
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
Since Duan Qirui has re-emerged

599
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
the power struggle is bound to be even more fierce.

600
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,480
Yet Peking University has in contrast become a sanctuary.

601
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,760
Master Cai,

602
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,880
this is a good opportunity for you to distinguish yourself.

603
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,560
Jiemin,

604
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,880
hurry and return to teaching.

605
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
Let classes resume at Peking University soon.

606
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,280
With this valuable assistance from the two of you,

607
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,280
I, Cai Yuanpei, will be certain to do my utmost.

608
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,640
How about this?

609
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
The darkness tonight is scintillating.

610
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,160
Why don't the three of us get thoroughly drunk?

611
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,680
Alright.

612
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,360
Alright. Get the alcohol!

613
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,520
Gentlemen, I am very happy today.

614
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,760
We've finally broke through the clouds to see the sun.

615
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,320
Due to the recent chaos of war,

616
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,000
Peking University was forced to stop classes.

617
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,680
Now the trouble has finally passed.

618
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,640
We can settle down and teach.

619
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,080
Settle down and research.

620
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,360
Settle down and

621
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,080
implement our plans to reform Peking University.

622
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,720
I also want to tell everyone that

623
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,280
the plans for education reforms at Peking University,

624
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,640
methods of evaluation,

625
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,160
and other proposals

626
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,840
and all been appoved by the ministry of education.

627
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,360
In additional, funding for Peking University has also been increased.

628
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
The red teaching building that we are constructing

629
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,200
will soon be complete and put into operation.

630
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
These are all great things

631
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
the whole school has been looking forward to.

632
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,880
Finally, it will soon be time for the summer break.

633
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,560
This summer break will also be

634
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,000
exceptionally important for us.

635
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,400
Each department will be carrying out

636
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,040
academic course reforms in the new semester.

637
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,720
As well as proposals for classroom management,

638
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,040
and teaching assessment schemas.

639
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,120
The humanities department will be the test pilot for these programs.

640
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,600
We now invite Mr. Zhongfu to say a few words.

641
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,800
People are the primary factor

642
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,480
in all these reforms.

643
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,640
They are also the most difficult factor.

644
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
We put together a seniority list

645
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,840
at the last meeting

646
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
of the professorial appointments in the humanities department.

647
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,440
It has now been approved by the education ministry,

648
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
so there's not much obstacles there.

649
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,320
The next step of the appointments will soon begin.

650
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,160
The difficulty right now are terminations.

651
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Especially those of foreign scholars.

652
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,280
The foreign scholars currently at Peking University

653
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,080
were processed by the Republican government's Ministry of Education.

654
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,800
The school only provided nominal credentials.

655
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,760
Which is to say those foreign scholars

656
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
were supervised and appointed under the authority of the Ministry of Education.

657
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,880
The school was only in charge of paying them.

658
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
These conditions have produced

659
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
a number of foreign personnel only here to bulk up the numbers.

660
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,600
Giving rise to strong resentment on campus from many students and teachers.

661
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,000
If this problem is not fundamentally solved,

662
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,840
then the reforms at Peking University

663
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,400
I'm afraid will...

664
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,720
Will be for nought.

665
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
This problem is also very prominent in the sciences.

666
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
[Xia Yuanli, styled Fuyun, Dean of Sciences of Peking University]

667
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,760
It also needs to be changed.

668
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,440
Mister Cai,

669
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,480
as there is to be reform, authority should be commensurate with the position.

670
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,440
I suggest that the appointment of foreign scholars

671
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,040
should be the responsibility of the school again.

672
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,200
How about this. Each department will conduct surveys

673
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,720
and find out how many

674
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,240
unqualified foreign professors there are.

675
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,440
Then produce a detailed document.

676
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,000
The termination of domestic scholars is also a problem.

677
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,840


678
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,160


679
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,560
