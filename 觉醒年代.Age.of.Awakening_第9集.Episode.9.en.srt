668
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,840
The most opinionated person in the liberal arts is Gu Hongming.

669
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,160
Many students all raised this issue up.

670
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,560
This Gu Hongming defected to Zhang Xun and participated in the restoration.

671
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,160
He should be removed from Peking University.

672
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,880
If he doesn't attend the meeting today, it's because he's lacking confidence.

673
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,840
Right!

674
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,520
How can you speak like that? Huh?

675
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,600
Regarding Gu Hongming's issue,

676
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,560
we don't need to discuss this here today.

677
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,960
According to the Ministry of Education's request,

678
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,400
the school's appraisal committee members needs to re-elected. 

679
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,000
The Ministry of Education in the middle of drafting

680
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,640
the qualifications and conditions of committee members.

681
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,920
About the issue of dismissing a fixed post,

682
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,440
this issue will be handed over to

683
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,360
the new semester's appraisal committee

684
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,640
to discuss a decision.

685
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,080
Does everyone agree? 

686
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,560
Agreed!

687
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:42,800
Good!

688
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Agreed. Agreed. Agreed.

689
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,400
Agreed.

690
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,680
Hu Shi is back!

691
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Hu Shi!

692
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Hu Shi is back!

693
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,440
Master Cai.

694
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,480
You fell asleep?

695
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,200
My goodness. You scared me.

696
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,280
Take a look, my beans all fell.

697
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,240
You have to compensate my beans.

698
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,000
Chen Duxiu, ah, Chen Duxiu.

699
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,520
It's still you

700
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
who can in the president's room of Peking University

701
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
and talk so brazenly.

702
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,240
Brother Jiemin, don't blame me. I'm just so excited.

703
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
Hu Shi has returned!

704
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,680
He will reach Shanghai the day after tomorrow.

705
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,960
I want to apply to go to Shanghai to pick him up.

706
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
Let him return to the school earlier to register. 

707
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,480
You're going to pick him up?

708
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,560
This, isn't this a little excessive?

709
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,120
Master Cai,

710
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
what about your three visits just to hire me?

711
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
I'm going to Shanghai to pick up a man of talent,

712
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,920
how is this excessive?

713
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,720
They all say you, Chen Duxiu, this condescending person,

714
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,720
is actually not entirely so.

715
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,880
Okay, okay, okay. In any case, you are the Dean of Liberal Arts.

716
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,680
This is a matter of your duty. I won't interfere.

717
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,040
This is simply my job

718
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,640
but the logistics still depends on you.

719
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,080
Relax, I already thought it over for you.

720
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,760
Really?

721
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,400
You need to bring this to Shanghai.

722
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,280
We appoint Mr. Hu Shi, PhD in Philosophy

723
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,760
of Colombia University, United States,

724
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,240
as a professor of liberal arts in Peking University.

725
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
Monthly income is 260 silver dollars.

726
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,840
Hold on to this.

727
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:22,778
Wow.

728
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:25,298
Wow.

729
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,720
But right now

730
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,360
Hu Shi still hasn't gotten a PhD.

731
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,040
This contract will be brought down.

732
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,720
You forgot.

733
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,720
What was the letter of appointment I gave you?

734
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Chen Duxiu, former president of Anhui University,

735
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,080
excelling in morals and in academia,

736
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,480
endures and succeeds in the duty of Peking University's Dean of Liberal Arts.

737
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
The employer

738
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,560
sometimes just wants the hire.

739
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,320
He can't find any reason to oppose it.

740
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,320
This all needs flexibility.

741
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
It's also a matter that is to be used as a last resort.

742
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,040
Crafty old rabbit. Cunning.

743
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,760
Who are you talking about!

744
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,600
Wait a moment. That

745
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,520
Hu Shizhi,

746
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,080
I only saw some of his expositions and poems.

747
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,920
But this person's moral character

748
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,000
and temperament and so on, these I don't really know. 

749
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,680
All of this is what I will hear from you.

750
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,120
When he arrives at Peking University, the wages are very high.

751
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,880
I hope that he will not disgrace his mission,

752
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,720
will not fail to live up to our expectations.

753
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,320
He's the exception within the exception.

754
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,320
I believe in my intuition.

755
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,320
I also believe Hu Shi

756
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,000
will not fail to live up your expectations.

757
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,600
Master Cai.

758
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,120
You were looking for me?

759
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,960
Brother Yucai!

760
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,600
Why didn't you tell me when you arrived?

761
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,880
Deqian said you were looking for me.

762
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,560
I hurriedly made my way over. 

763
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,440
I'll give you a little introduction.

764
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,560
This is the Dean of Liberal Arts of Peking University, Mr. Chen Duxiu.

765
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,560
This is Mr. Zhou Shuren. 

766
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
I have heard of your name for a long time, a well-known reputation.

767
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,080
Brother Yucai, I wanted to pay a visit to you from early on.

768
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,600
Didn't expect to encounter you here.

769
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,120
Nice to meet you, nice to meet you.

770
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,160
No need, no need.

771
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,840
Come, come, let's sit down and talk.

772
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,560
Come, come.

773
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,360
Please sit.

774
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,120
Yucai.

775
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,920
I just wanted to talk about two things with you.

776
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,520
The first one

777
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,080
I want to have you come over to Peking University to teach.

778
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,240
Later Fan Yuanlian told me to ask you

779
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,000
to become a concurrent teacher.

780
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,240
Keep your public office at the Ministry of Education.

781
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,400
I thought this way is also good, neither one is neglected.

782
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,480
As long as you can come to Peking University to teach, then it's fine.

783
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
You see, it can work.

784
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,200
Master Cai, just arrange for me to take orders.

785
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,120
How is it?

786
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,120
Yucai comes over to Peking University to become a liberal arts professor. 

787
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,040
You, as the Dean of Liberal Arts

788
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,960
must immediately arrange his course well.

789
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,080
Excellent!

790
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,080
Another key figure is added to Peking University.

791
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,640
You should say our New Culture Movement

792
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,640
has added another key figure.

793
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,920
I describe the pen in Yucai's hands

794
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,080
like a surgeon's scalpel.

795
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,160
Incomparably sharp.

796
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,680
Yes. Our "New Youth"

797
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,920
was looking forward to Brother Yucai's writings early on.

798
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,480
I still hope Brother Yucai can draft many more.

799
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,880
Give what drafts?

800
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,880
Come to "New Youth".

801
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,160
Be a fellow editor.

802
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
If New Culture doesn't have a vanguard like you,

803
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,120
then that is a very big flaw.

804
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,720
How about it?

805
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,120
Yucai, the words that Mr. Zhongfu said just now

806
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,320
is the real thing.

807
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,600
Every word I say is to wish you can come to Peking University.

808
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,840
How is it? Become a member.

809
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
I'll listen to Master Cai.

810
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,520
Good! Brother Yucai.

811
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
You can join "New Youth".

812
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,400
Extremely honored.

813
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,040
Excellent.

814
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,320
Today is really a good day.

815
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,320
Shizhi (=Hu Shi), Yucai have all come.

816
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
Master Cai, then I will prepare to go to Shanghai now.

817
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,800
You hurry and go.

818
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
Yucai, wait for me until I come back from Shanghai

819
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,680
to come to my house.

820
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,960
"New Youth" is at my house.

821
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,280
See you later, see you later!

822
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,400
Safe travels!

823
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,640
Yucai.

824
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Zhongfu is a carefree person.

825
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,560
Free and unconstrained.

826
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,080
Don't take offense.

827
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,280
Come, please sit.

828
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,480
The second matter I want to ask you to do 

829
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,840
is to design a university crest for Peking University.

830
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,040
University crest?

831
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,680
Okay.

832
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,320
Then do you have any specific opinions and requirements.

833
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
I don't have specific requirements.

834
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,880
Yucai, your opinions

835
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,240
is my, Cai Yuanpei's opinion.

836
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,080
Master Cai, you have spoken highly of me.

837
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,120
No, I have never flattered people.

838
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,440
I think the most acute and profound problems

839
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,080
are seen in China at present.

840
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,400
You, Zhou Shuren are one who has seen them.

841
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
I believe the crest you will design for Peking University,

842
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
the students of Peking University

843
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,200
will continue to wear it for generations to come.

844
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
It will never fade.

845
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Okay. I'll try.

846
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,720
Younger brother! Let me have a bite!

847
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,840
Not giving it to you!

848
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,040
Let me have a bite!

849
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,560
Zimei, don't fight over that with Henian

850
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,600
Mom's frying over here.

851
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,360
Mom! Fry one for me.

852
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,560
Aren't I frying here?

853
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,840
It'll be done right away. Don't be anxious.

854
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,680
Henian! Give me a bite!

855
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,680
Junman!

856
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,800
You've come back!

857
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,240
Help me pack my luggage. I am going to Shanghai.

858
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:14,880
Going to Shanghai?

859
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,360
Right.

860
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,320
When are you going?

861
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,280
Early tomorrow morning.

862
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,760
Then I'll hurry over to walk around Qianmen Street.

863
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,280
What are you going to Qianmen Street for?

864
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
To buy Qiaonian and Yannian some things.

865
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,360
I am going there to receive Hu Shi, Hu Shizhi.

866
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,520
Then, you're not going to see the two boys at Shanghai?

867
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000
Then when I bump into them, I'll meet them.

868
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,640
So, bumping into them means should still buy some things.

869
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,640
Come, come here and fry something for the two.

870
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,080
I'll hurry up and go.

871
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,680
Don't buy too much, okay?

872
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,200
I only have one suitcase, not bringing much.

873
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,400
Alright, just one luggage. 

874
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:49,065
[Shanghai]

875
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,640
Zhongfu, why did take so many bags?

876
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,800
Big bags, small bundles, are you escaping from a famine?

877
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,920
Gao Junman!

878
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,200
I already said I'm only bringing one bag.

879
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,880
All of a sudden, she managed to pack five!

880
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,400
Just for the two punks

881
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,840
to have food, clothes, drinks and tools!

882
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,920
She's almost moved the whole Qianmen pavilion over.

883
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,680
Junman is also very good to the children.

884
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,600
This... this suitcase.

885
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,760
There's still give more bags.

886
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,960
It seems there's eight bags.

887
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,120
Anyways, there's already this many, and I'm not lacking those few.

888
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,400
I'll add another three bags.

889
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,600
Where's Hu Shi?

890
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,736
He went back home.

891
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:21,778
He went back home?

892
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,080
It's like this. His mother has gotten ill all of a sudden.

893
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,160
Yesterday morning a telegram arrived

894
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,760
in the afternoon he hurried back.

895
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,520
He had me tell you

896
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,560
wait for him to finish handling his family maters, then he'll go to Beijing to hold the teaching position. 

897
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,680
As a matter of fact, yesterday

898
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,960
I still wanted to give you a telegram.

899
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,480
You were already on the road, though.

900
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,240
Where are Qiaonian, Yannian?

901
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,280
At Aurora University.

902
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,800
Then I'm going to Jixi, to look for Shizhi.

903
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,640
What are you going to Jixi for?

904
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,080
Someone went back home to handle private matters.

905
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,680
If you go, won't you give people an inconvenience?

906
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,680
How about this. You help me take these bags

907
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,800
to go to Aurora University

908
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,320
and give these things over to Yannian and Qiaonian.

909
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,680
Otherwise these things will go bad.

910
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,800
D-d-don't go.

911
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,080
You also don't need to go to the school.

912
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,600
I'll talk to the two

913
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,120
and get them to come see you.

914
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
Then what did I come here for?

915
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,120
Don't be so anxious, listen to me.

916
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,240
There's two friends, they heard you came to Shanghai.

917
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,840
Wants to urgently come see you.

918
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,480
Who?

919
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,200
Yi Baisha, Zou Yongcheng.

920
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,880
They're in Shanghai?

921
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,360
They are in Shanghai.

922
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,360
Brother Zhongfu!

923
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,560
Yongcheng!

924
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,840
Zhongfu.

925
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,360
I missed you, Zhongfu.

926
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,240
Is everything alright you guys?

927
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,160
Hurry and sit.

928
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,080
Here.

929
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,600
You guys... how did you guys get together?

930
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
Zhongfu.

931
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
My unit got dissolved. 

932
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,680
[Zou Yongcheng, styled Qizhi]

933
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,760
Right now I'm in the provincial military governor's office, working as an advisor.

934
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,800
Honestly, there's really nothing to do.

935
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,120
As a matter of fact, Baisha was at Hunan teaching.

936
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,280
Us two often group up to drink our sorrows away.

937
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,611
[Yi Baisha, styled Yuecun, Scholar of the New Culture Movement]

938
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,480
Coming back this time, is to procure arms for the Hunan army.

939
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,480
He is my advisor.

940
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,200
Baisha, you, this master,

941
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,400
why are you also playing with firearms?

942
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
Why can't I be playing with firearms?

943
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,320
You also once followed Mr. Cai Yuanpei.

944
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,520
Didn't you make a bomb?

945
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,000
Baisha.

946
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,240
Is there a matter you are not happy with?

947
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,240
He went to Guangzhou and saw Mr. [Sun] Yat-sen who returned.

948
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,280
What did Mr. [Sun] Yat-sen say to you?

949
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,960
Warlords.

950
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,760
Defeat the warlords.

951
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,400
Defeat the warlords. Easier said than done.

952
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,480
How many warlords are there in China?

953
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
Which warlord

954
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,520
does not have a foreign power behind him?

955
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,600
Fortunately, Europe at war.

956
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,680
Otherwise, 

957
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,040
they would've divided China up early on.

958
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,440
Lamentable, so lamentable.

959
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,440
Such a big country like this

960
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,120
unexpectedly we don't have a unifying leader.

961
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,600
These warlords, each and every one,

962
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
has an ugly appearance of "as soon as you finish singing, I go on stage".

963
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,720
Creating a foul atmosphere and causing everything to be in disarray.

964
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,080
Leaving people bitterly disappointed. 

965
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,840
In the eyes of these warlords

966
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,760
Mr. [Sun] Yat-sen is actually just a figurehead.

967
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,640
The founder of the Republic.

968
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
The leader of the revolutionaries.

969
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,800
Recognized around the world.

970
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,640
The Chinese people's key figure

971
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,120
right now in each and every warlord

972
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,280
is being played with in the palm of their hands.

973
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:28,973
Suffering time and time again.

974
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,960
This country is finished.
