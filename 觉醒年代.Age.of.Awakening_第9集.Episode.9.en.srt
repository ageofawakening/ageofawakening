00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,120
Who are they taking?

189
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
On the list is Guo Xingang, a liberal arts student,

190
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,400
Deng Zhongxia, and so on.

191
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,280
There seems to be Li Dazhao.

192
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,040
Outrageous.

193
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
Inform the doorman to close the school gate.

194
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,280
We cannot let the Queue Army's cavalry rush into the campus.

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
You get my car ready.

196
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Yes.

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,240
Master Cai, don't get excited.

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
I am certain this Zhang Xun Restoration

199
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,240
will be a farce

200
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,280
and will not achieve anything.

201
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
It would be better to bide our time.

202
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,760
Zhongfu. Now, Peking University has become

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,120
the benchmark of New Culture.

204
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
In the face of this major issue of principle,

205
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,600
we must make our position clear to him.

206
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
I am going to resign.

207
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
I am going to protest.

208
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,840
I am going to the Ministry of Education!

209
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,080
What are you going to do in the Ministry of Education at this time?

210
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,920
Zhongfu. Politics can make a big difference.

211
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,040
Since the Queue Army is destined to be short-lived,

212
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,280
I will make a big fuss about it.

213
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,440
Isn't it good to contribute to our new Peking University?

214
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,160
Or you, you sly old rabbit. Admirable.

215
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
I see. Mr. Zhao.

216
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,080
You go with Mister,

217
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,960
the road is not safe.

218
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,520
Yes.

219
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
No, I can go alone.

220
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
The key is

221
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,200
to let Li Dazhao leave quickly and avoid it.

222
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Rest assured, Shouchang has left Beijing

223
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,600
to go to Shanghai.

224
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,560
Excellent.

225
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
I'm leaving. Go.

226
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:13,122
[Zhou Shuren (Lu Xun), styled Yucai, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

227
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
Master Cai.

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,200
You are here.

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
Yucai, what are you doing here?

230
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
I want to make a statement.

231
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
In case in the future,

232
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
they say I am in cahoots with Zhang Xun.

233
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,600
Alright.

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
I told you that you wouldn't let yourself fall behind.

235
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,320
Come to Peking University to teach.

236
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
The New Culture Movement advocated by Peking University

237
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,240
also needs your talents to participate in it.

238
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,320
I listen to Master Cai.

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Just go back.

240
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,400
Don't stay here too long now that your position is clear.

241
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,360
I have another very important thing

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,880
to ask you.

243
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
When you have time,

244
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
find a chance to come by my place sometime.

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,200
Alright.

246
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,200
Master Cai.

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
With the chaos of war, are you here on official business?

248
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
The same as you.

249
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,120
Look, Jiemin will be here soon.

250
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
Minister Fan. President Cai Yuanpei has arrived.

251
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,640
Show him in.

252
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,840
You see.

253
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,800
President Cai. Please.

254
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,080
You.

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,480
What's so funny?

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320
Why are you laughing?

257
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,920
With the current situation like this,

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,040
you can still laugh?

259
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
Brother Jiemin, I'm laughing at Brother Botang's sublime acumen.

260
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,520
He brought me good tea a long while ago,

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
saying Cai Jiemin is certain to come later to hand in his resignation.

262
00:10:55,248 --> 00:11:00,279
[Fan Yuanlian, styled Jingsheng, Minister of Education]

263
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
Told me to just steep my tea and wait.

264
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,000
I, uh, came to ask Brother Botang for advice.

265
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:06,237
[Wang Daxie, styled Botang, Diplomat of the Beiyang government]

266
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,080
What do you think is going on?

267
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
How did the city of Beijing

268
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
become the Queue Army's territory overnight?

269
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,840
What a farce.

270
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
This pro-Japanese Duan Qirui wants to send troops to Europe.

271
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
And Li Yuanhong

272
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
is not willing to let Duan Qirui exercise dictatorship.

273
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
As expected,

274
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
it is said that Li Yuanhong fell for Zhang Xun's ploy.

275
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
Zhang Xun was taken in by Duan Qirui.

276
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,640
What makes you say that?

277
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,160
Li Yuanhong asked Zhang Xun to coordinate the Li-Duan dispute,

278
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
which led to the wolf entering the room.

279
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,800
Zhang Xun was encouraged by Duan Qirui

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,520
to let Li Yuantong resign and let little Xuantong restore the throne.

281
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
The result is widespread indignation and discontent, that will be defamed throughout history.

282
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
Brother Botang, what do you think?

283
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
How will this situation develop now?

284
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
Now the whole country is denouncing Zhang Xun.

285
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,960
In Tianjin, Duan Qirui

286
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,680
has issued a campaign against rebellion.

287
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,120
And organized a rebel army

288
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,720
to attack the capital.

289
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,560
Zhang Xun's five-thousand-strong Queue Army

290
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,400
will collapse at the first blow for sure!

291
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,520
In the end, Duan Qirui will definitely make a comeback.

292
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,080
He defeated Zhang Xun

293
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,840
and drove out Li Yuanhong

294
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,560
and gained a reputation for defending the Republic.

295
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
This... This is killing three birds with one stone.

296
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,800
If that's the case,

297
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,000
then where does that leave us?

298
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,240
I and Jingsheng can quietly

299
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
watch how the current situation will evolve.

300
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
And you?

301
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,280
You must leave Beijing as soon as possible.

302
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,720
Lie low.

303
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,051
Why?

304
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:40,969
Why?

305
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,520
Why must I leave and lie low?

306
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
Peking University is the first of the new ideological trend.

307
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,000
Once the war starts,

308
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
the Queue Clique must be prevented from desperate recklessness

309
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,600
that would make an example out of Peking University.

310
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
If you ran away,

311
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
Then you'll have nothing to do with Peking University and Zhang Xun.

312
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,920
In the future, it will be a bargaining chip for you with Duan Qirui.

313
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,360
Smart, extremely smart.

314
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,080
Okay, okay, I'll listen to you.

315
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
I'll go back to the school and make arrangements.

316
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,960
How about this.

317
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm going to Tianjin to hide tonight.

318
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,360
Good.

319
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,520
That will do, Brother Jiemin.

320
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,120
You brought your props

321
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
for a spin around my Ministry of Education.

322
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,800
You've got a good hand.

323
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,000
And even more tricks up your sleeves than him.

324
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,840
Come.

325
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
I hope this farce will end soon

326
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,280
so that you and I can have peace of mind.

327
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,806
Zhongfu!

328
00:13:58,529 --> 00:13:59,514
Zhongfu!

329
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,120
Junman, don't be afraid.

330
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
Did you hear it?

331
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
What's going on? What was...

332
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,040
What happened?

333
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,880
It seems that Duan Qirui's rebel army

334
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
is fighting Zhang Xun's Queue Army,

335
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,640
which is far from us.

336
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,720
Will they fire cannons?

337
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
They won't.

338
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,600
Neither Duan Qirui nor Zhang Xun dared

339
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,040
to open fire at Beijing.

340
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,320
Don't worry. It's nothing.

341
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,400
You said they wouldn't fire cannons.

342
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,520
What is this?

343
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,000
It may be that the rebel army is bombing the city gate with explosives.

344
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
Why are you so sure it wasn't cannons?

345
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,240
I made explosives with Cai Jiemin.

346
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,600
That's the sound.

347
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,760
Do you think the battle will get to Shanghai?

348
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,280
Will Yannian and Qiaonian be all right?

349
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,120
The battle won't get to Shanghai.

350
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
It'll be a few chaotic days at most.

351
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,200
Rest assured.

352
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
I have asked someone to bring a message to Wang Mengzou.

353
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
asking him to take care of Yannian and Qiaonian.

354
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,200
Dad, I'm scared!

355
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't be scared.

356
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,080
Let us through.

357
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,680
Take care, sir.

The Manchu Restoration has made the current political situation unpeaceful.

381
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,560
Look!

382
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,640
Long queues, short queues.

had to do this restoration thing?

Now we can't go to school,

423
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,800
Exactly. My mom wouldn't even let me out.

The Republic is not even six years old,

428
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,920

429
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,480
What do you think is the cause of this?

430

How can we help you?

438
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840

439
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,280
There is a guest here from Beijing

440
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
who has asked the two of you to eat with them.

441
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,440
A guest here?

442
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,160
That's right.

443
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,680

Mr. Wang, I've long heard

[Wang Mengzou, Manager of Yadong Library]

450
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,160
that brother Zhongfu's two sons are great.

451
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,560
Honest to a fault, chivalrous and daring.

452
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,200
Seeing you two today, you are indeed heroic youth

453
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
with exceptional bearing.

454
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,600
Mr. Shouchang,

455
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
Qiaonian and I are your admirers.

456
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,920
We can both recite your essay "Youth" from memory.

457
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
That makes me very happy.

458
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,360
That essay was written for youth

459
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
like the two of you.

460
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
Come, sit.

461
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
Mr. Shouchang, let's move to the drawing room.

462
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,720
No need. It's fine here.

463
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,680
Then sit here, please.

464
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,440
It's no bother, Mr. Wang.

465
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,320
Sit here.

466
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,160
I'm ashamed to be here this time.

467
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,640
Running off in a panic, in dire straits.

468
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Brother Zhongfu brought word

469
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
that I must come to the Yadong Library.

470
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,360
First, to let everyone know we are safe.

471
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,080
Second, to investigate "New Youth"'s

472
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,720
operational condition.

473
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
Third, to make some new friends.

474
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.

475
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,520
Not at all, not at all.

476
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,560
How is Zhongfu?

477
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,040
Your father is very busy person right now.

478
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,440
He is helping Mr. Cai with reforms at Peking University,

479
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,360
which are going swimmingly.

480
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,040
Running "New Youth",

481
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,480
advocating for the New Culture movement,

482
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,480
it's all very impressive.

483
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
It's only that the current political situation is difficult.

484
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,880
Every step forward is challenging.

485
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,680
To be able to move a bit every day, like a pawn, is productive enough.

486
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,080
Mr. Shouchang,

487
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,920
does this Zhang Xun Restoration

488
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,160
affect the reforms at Peking University?

489
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,320
The new zeitgeist of reform at Peking University

490
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,720
is definitely intolerable for the likes of Zhang Xun.

491
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,800
But at the moment it looks like

492
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,040
the restoration will come to a premature end.

493
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,800
As for the situation in the future,

494
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,160
it depends.

495
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,000
Then what do you think about the present state of affairs?

496
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
I think the situation is not encouraging.

497
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,360
Brother Zhongfu once said

498
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,520
that after Yuan Shikai

499
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
there is bound to be a period of fighting between warlords.

500
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,720
And now everyone can see.

501
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
Europe has gone to war.

502
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
The world is a mess.

503
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,560
China is poor and weak.

504
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Fragmented and disorganized like a heap of sand.

505
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,680
With internal trouble and external aggression, it is hard to be independent.

506
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
If China is like this, what is the way forward?

507
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
The Zhang Xun Restoration

508
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
broke the hearts of many people.

509
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
No hint in sight for which course to follow

510
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
to get out of the predicament.

511
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,720
But none of us have given up.

512
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,080
Then from what you can tell,

513
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,360
do you think the theory of anarchism

514
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,120
can help China?

515
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,040
I don't think so.

516
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,440
I've read anarchist books.

517
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,680
This theory seems to hold a lot of attraction.

518
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,120
But very utopian.

519
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm afraid it won't work in practice.

520
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
I think Kropotkin's Mutual Aid

521
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,040
can solve China's problems.

522
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,640
Moreover, it is the only way out.

523
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,080
Yannian,

524
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,080
do you see a single country in Europe

525
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
forming its state policy in accordance with the doctrine of mutual aid?

526
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,760
You're still young now.

527
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,520
At this time,

528
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,160
there is no harm in reading widely, listeningly widely.

529
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,600
In considering problems and thinking things through, don't go to the extremes.

530
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,160
Mr. Shouchang is right.

531
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Do you have any plans for this visit to Shanghai?

532
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,280
I plan to use this time

533
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
to properly sort out my own thoughts

534
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,120
and reflect on some questions.

535
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,680
I also want to spend some time amongst the people.

536
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,240
I want to see the real China,

537
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
what it's actually like.

538
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,280
Mr. Li.

539
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,240
Hello.

540
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,520
Mengzou,

541
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
the table has been set, and the wine has been warmed.

542
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,760
Invite everyone to take their seats.

543
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
Then why don't we talk while we eat.

544
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,480
Mr. Wang, after you.

545
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,160
This way, please.

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
The Xuantong Emperor has abdicated again.

552
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,000
Zhang Xun has fled to the Dutch embassy.

553
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,680
Li Yuanhong has resigned.

554
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
Feng Guozhang is the acting president.

555
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,440
Republican hero Duan Qirui returned to the capital.

556
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,612
Extra! Extra!

557
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:11,286
Extra! Extra!

558
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,120
The Xuantong Emperor has abdicated again.

Zhang Xun has fled to the Dutch embassy.

560
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,600
Li Yuanhong has resigned.

561
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
Feng Guozhang is the acting president.

562
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,640
Republican hero Duan Qirui returned to the capital.

563
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
Extra! Extra!

564
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
The Xuantong Emperor has abdicated again.

565
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,720
Take it back. Even half price will do.

566
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,360
Just bought it yesterday.

567
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:32,325
Scammer!

568
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
He's abdicated!

569
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,800
The Xuantong Emperor has abdicated!

570
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
Zhang Xun has fled!

571
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,800
Hear ye! Hear ye! Listen up.

572
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,800
Hot off the press.

573
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,800
Queue-wearing army comes to Beijing

574
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,800
Then the commotion of taking the throne

575
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
People adding to the ruckus

576
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
Just to make a buck of their own.

577
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,160
Old brother,

578
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,840
I say there's no need to pick it up.

579
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
Save it. Who knows? It might be useful again.

580
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Feng Guozhang is the acting president.

581
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,520
Republican hero Duan Qirui returned to the capital.

582
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:31,440
"Warhorses keep roaring on and on"

583
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,440
"Gods and demons fear the Green Dragon Crescent Blade"

584
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,280
"Now with orders to march north of the river"

585
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,480
"We will clash swords with Cao Cao"

586
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:57,040
"The warhorses shall be quartered at the Han Ford" (Shao opera)

587
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,280
Ah yikes!

588
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,200
Brother Jiemin,

589
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,800
you are so elegant.

590
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,520
Your exemplary reputation is being undermined.

591
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
I am truly sorry.

592
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,040
For shame! For shame!

593
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
Come, please. Please sit.

594
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,760
Please sit.

595
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,680
It truly...

596
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
It truly is not elegant. It truly is not.

597
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,200
Master Cai,

598
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,000
come.

599
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,880
What is this?

600
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,080
First, your resignation letter.

601
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
Returned as is.

602
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,680
Second, a commendation seal for you from Duan Qirui

603
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
and an order that increases Peking University's funds.

604
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,960
Third, agreement from the education ministry with Peking University's reforms.

605
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,320
And wholesale approval of the professor recruitment plan.

606
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,720
Master Cai, this is a big prize.

607
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,280
Didn't expect Zhang Xun's queue-wearing army

608
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,800
would provide such additional assistance to Peking University.

609
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,480
For Peking University, this has been a blessing in disguise.

610
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,320
A silver lining indeed.

611
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,720
The current political situation is tumultuous.

612
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,560
All these political bigwigs

613
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,320
now want to use you, Cai Yuanpei,

614
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,680
and Peking University to keep up appearances.

615
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,800
You are now the belle of the ball.

616
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,280
It's true.

617
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
Since Duan Qirui has re-emerged

618
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
the power struggle is bound to be even more fierce.

619
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,480
Yet Peking University has in contrast become a sanctuary.

620
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,760
Master Cai,

621
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,880
this is a good opportunity for you to distinguish yourself.

622
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,560
Jiemin,

623
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,880
hurry and return to teaching.

624
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
Let classes resume at Peking University soon.

625
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,280
With this valuable assistance from the two of you,

626
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,280
I, Cai Yuanpei, will be certain to do my utmost.

627
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,640
How about this?

628
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
The darkness tonight is scintillating.

629
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,160
Why don't the three of us get thoroughly drunk?

630
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,680
Alright.

631
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,360
Alright. Get the alcohol!

632
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,520
Gentlemen, I am very happy today.

633
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,760
We've finally broke through the clouds to see the sun.

634
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,320
Due to the recent chaos of war,

635
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,000
Peking University was forced to stop classes.

636
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,680
Now the trouble has finally passed.

637
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,640
We can settle down and teach.

638
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,080
Settle down and research.

639
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,360
Settle down and

640
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,080
implement our plans to reform Peking University.

641
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,720
I also want to tell everyone that

642
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,280
the plans for education reforms at Peking University,

643
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,640
methods of evaluation,

644
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,160
and other proposals

645
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,840
and all been appoved by the ministry of education.

646
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,360
In additional, funding for Peking University has also been increased.

647
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
The red teaching building that we are constructing

648
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,200
will soon be complete and put into operation.

649
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
These are all great things

650
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
the whole school has been looking forward to.

651
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,880
Finally, it will soon be time for the summer break.

652
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,560
This summer break will also be

653
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,000
exceptionally important for us.

654
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,400
Each department will be carrying out

655
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,040
academic course reforms in the new semester.

656
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,720
As well as proposals for classroom management,

657
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,040
and teaching assessment schemas.

658
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,120
The humanities department will be the test pilot for these programs.

659
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,600
We now invite Mr. Zhongfu to say a few words.

660
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,800
People are the primary factor

661
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,480
in all these reforms.

662
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,640
They are also the most difficult factor.

663
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
We put together a seniority list

664
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,840
at the last meeting

665
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
of the professorial appointments in the humanities department.

666
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,440
It has now been approved by the education ministry,

667
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
so there's not much obstacles there.

668
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,320
The next step of the appointments will soon begin.

669
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,160
The difficulty right now are terminations.

670
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Especially those of foreign scholars.

671
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,280
The foreign scholars currently at Peking University

672
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,080
were processed by the Republican government's Ministry of Education.

673
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,800
The school only provided nominal credentials.

674
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,760
Which is to say those foreign scholars

675
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
were supervised and appointed under the authority of the Ministry of Education.

676
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,880
The school was only in charge of paying them.

677
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
These conditions have produced

678
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
a number of foreign personnel only here to bulk up the numbers.

679
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,600
Giving rise to strong resentment on campus from many students and teachers.

680
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,000
If this problem is not fundamentally solved,

681
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,840
then the reforms at Peking University

682
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,400
I'm afraid will...

683
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,720
Will be for nought.

684
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
This problem is also very prominent in the sciences.

685
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
[Xia Yuanli, styled Fuyun, Dean of Sciences of Peking University]

686
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,760
It also needs to be changed.

687
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,440
Mister Cai,

688
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,480
as there is to be reform, authority should be commensurate with the position.

689
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,440
I suggest that the appointment of foreign scholars

690
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,040
should be the responsibility of the school again.

691
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,200
How about this. Each department will conduct surveys

692
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,720
and find out how many

693
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,240
unqualified foreign professors there are.

694
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,440
Then produce a detailed document.

695
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,000
The termination of domestic scholars is also a problem.

696
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,840
The most opinionated person in the liberal arts is Gu Hongming.

697
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,160
Many students all raised this issue up.

698
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,560
This Gu Hongming defected to Zhang Xun and participated in the restoration.

699
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,160
He should be removed from Peking University.

700
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,880
If he doesn't attend the meeting today, it's because he's lacking confidence.

701
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,840
Right!

702
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,520
How can you speak like that? Huh?

703
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,600
Regarding Gu Hongming's issue,

704
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,560
we don't need to discuss this here today.

705
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,960
According to the Ministry of Education's request,

706
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,400
the school's appraisal committee members needs to re-elected.

707
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,000
The Ministry of Education in the middle of drafting

708
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,640
the qualifications and conditions of committee members.

709
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,920
About the issue of dismissing a fixed post,

710
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,440
this issue will be handed over to

711
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,360
the new semester's appraisal committee

712
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,640
to discuss a decision.

713
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,080
Does everyone agree?

714
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,560
Agreed!

715
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:42,800
Good!

716
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Agreed. Agreed. Agreed.

717
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,400
Agreed.

718
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,680
Hu Shi is back!

719
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Hu Shi!

720
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Hu Shi is back!

721
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,440
Master Cai.

722
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,480
You fell asleep?

723
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,200
My goodness. You scared me.

724
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,280
Take a look, my beans all fell.

725
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,240
You have to compensate my beans.

726
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,000
Chen Duxiu, ah, Chen Duxiu.

727
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,520
It's still you

728
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
who can in the president's room of Peking University

729
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
and talk so brazenly.

730
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,240
Brother Jiemin, don't blame me. I'm just so excited.

731
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
Hu Shi has returned!

732
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,680
He will reach Shanghai the day after tomorrow.

733
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,960
I want to apply to go to Shanghai to pick him up.

734
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
Let him return to the school earlier to register.

735
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,480
You're going to pick him up?

736
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,560
This, isn't this a little excessive?

737
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,120
Master Cai,

738
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
what about your three visits just to hire me?

739
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
I'm going to Shanghai to pick up a man of talent,

740
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,920
how is this excessive?

741
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,720
They all say you, Chen Duxiu, this condescending person,

742
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,720
is actually not entirely so.

743
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,880
Okay, okay, okay. In any case, you are the Dean of Liberal Arts.

744
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,680
This is a matter of your duty. I won't interfere.

745
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,040
This is simply my job

746
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,640
but the logistics still depends on you.

747
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,080
Relax, I already thought it over for you.

748
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,760
Really?

749
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,400
You need to bring this to Shanghai.

750
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,280
We appoint Mr. Hu Shi, PhD in Philosophy

751
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,760
of Colombia University, United States,

752
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,240
as a professor of liberal arts in Peking University.

753
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
Monthly income is 260 silver dollars.

754
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,840
Hold on to this.

755
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:22,778
Wow.

756
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:25,298
Wow.

757
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,720
But right now

758
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,360
Hu Shi still hasn't gotten a PhD.

759
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,040
This contract will be brought down.

760
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,720
You forgot.

761
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,720
What was the letter of appointment I gave you?

762
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Chen Duxiu, former president of Anhui University,

763
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,080
excelling in morals and in academia,

764
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,480
endures and succeeds in the duty of Peking University's Dean of Liberal Arts.

765
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
The employer

766
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,560
sometimes just wants the hire.

767
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,320
He can't find any reason to oppose it.

768
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,320
This all needs flexibility.

769
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
It's also a matter that is to be used as a last resort.

770
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,040
Crafty old rabbit. Cunning.

771
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,760
Who are you talking about!

772
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,600
Wait a moment. That

773
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,520
Hu Shizhi,

774
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,080
I only saw some of his expositions and poems.

775
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,920
But this person's moral character

776
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,000
and temperament and so on, these I don't really know.

777
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,680
All of this is what I will hear from you.

778
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,120
When he arrives at Peking University, the wages are very high.

779
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,880
I hope that he will not disgrace his mission,

780
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,720
will not fail to live up to our expectations.

781
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,320
He's the exception within the exception.

782
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,320
I believe in my intuition.

783
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,320
I also believe Hu Shi

784
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,000
will not fail to live up your expectations.

785
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,600
Master Cai.

786
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,120
You were looking for me?

787
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,960
Brother Yucai!

788
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,600
Why didn't you tell me when you arrived?

789
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,880
Deqian said you were looking for me.

790
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,560
I hurriedly made my way over.

791
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,440
I'll give you a little introduction.

792
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,560
This is the Dean of Liberal Arts of Peking University, Mr. Chen Duxiu.

793
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,560
This is Mr. Zhou Shuren.

794
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
I have heard of your name for a long time, a well-known reputation.

795
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,080
Brother Yucai, I wanted to pay a visit to you from early on.

796
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,600
Didn't expect to encounter you here.

797
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,120
Nice to meet you, nice to meet you.

798
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,160
No need, no need.

799
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,840
Come, come, let's sit down and talk.

800
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,560
Come, come.

801
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,360
Please sit.

802
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,120
Yucai.

803
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,920
I just wanted to talk about two things with you.

804
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,520
The first one

805
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,080
I want to have you come over to Peking University to teach.

806
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,240
Later Fan Yuanlian told me to ask you

807
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,000
to become a concurrent teacher.

808
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,240
Keep your public office at the Ministry of Education.

809
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,400
I thought this way is also good, neither one is neglected.

810
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,480
As long as you can come to Peking University to teach, then it's fine.

811
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
You see, it can work.

812
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,200
Master Cai, just arrange for me to take orders.

813
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,120
How is it?

814
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,120
Yucai comes over to Peking University to become a liberal arts professor.

815
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,040
You, as the Dean of Liberal Arts

816
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,960
must immediately arrange his course well.

817
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,080
Excellent!

818
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,080
Another key figure is added to Peking University.

819
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,640
You should say our New Culture Movement

820
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,640
has added another key figure.

821
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,920
I describe the pen in Yucai's hands

822
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,080
like a surgeon's scalpel.

823
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,160
Incomparably sharp.

824
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,680
Yes. Our "New Youth"

825
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,920
was looking forward to Brother Yucai's writings early on.

826
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,480
I still hope Brother Yucai can draft many more.

827
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,880
Give what drafts?

828
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,880
Come to "New Youth".

829
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,160
Be a fellow editor.

830
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
If New Culture doesn't have a vanguard like you,

831
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,120
then that is a very big flaw.

832
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,720
How about it?

833
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,120
Yucai, the words that Mr. Zhongfu said just now

834
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,320
is the real thing.

835
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,600
Every word I say is to wish you can come to Peking University.

836
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,840
How is it? Become a member.

837
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
I'll listen to Master Cai.

838
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,520
Good! Brother Yucai.

839
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
You can join "New Youth".

840
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,400
Extremely honored.

841
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,040
Excellent.

842
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,320
Today is really a good day.

843
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,320
Shizhi (=Hu Shi), Yucai have all come.

844
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
Master Cai, then I will prepare to go to Shanghai now.

845
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,800
You hurry and go.

846
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
Yucai, wait for me until I come back from Shanghai

847
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,680
to come to my house.

848
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,960
"New Youth" is at my house.

849
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,280
See you later, see you later!

850
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,400
Safe travels!

851
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,640
Yucai.

852
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Zhongfu is a carefree person.

853
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,560
Free and unconstrained.

854
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,080
Don't take offense.

855
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,280
Come, please sit.

856
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,480
The second matter I want to ask you to do

857
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,840
is to design a university crest for Peking University.

858
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,040
University crest?

859
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,680
Okay.

860
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,320
Then do you have any specific opinions and requirements.

861
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
I don't have specific requirements.

862
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,880
Yucai, your opinions

863
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,240
is my, Cai Yuanpei's opinion.

864
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,080
Master Cai, you have spoken highly of me.

865
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,120
No, I have never flattered people.

866
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,440
I think the most acute and profound problems

867
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,080
are seen in China at present.

868
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,400
You, Zhou Shuren are one who has seen them.

869
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
I believe the crest you will design for Peking University,

870
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
the students of Peking University

871
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,200
will continue to wear it for generations to come.

872
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
It will never fade.

873
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Okay. I'll try.

874
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,720
Younger brother! Let me have a bite!

875
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,840
Not giving it to you!

876
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,040
Let me have a bite!

877
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,560
Zimei, don't fight over that with Henian

878
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,600
Mom's frying over here.

879
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,360
Mom! Fry one for me.

880
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,560
Aren't I frying here?

881
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,840
It'll be done right away. Don't be anxious.

882
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,680
Henian! Give me a bite!

883
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,680
Junman!

884
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,800
You've come back!

885
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,240
Help me pack my luggage. I am going to Shanghai.

886
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:14,880
Going to Shanghai?

887
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,360
Right.

888
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,320
When are you going?

889
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,280
Early tomorrow morning.

890
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,760
Then I'll hurry over to walk around Qianmen Street.

891
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,280
What are you going to Qianmen Street for?

892
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
To buy Qiaonian and Yannian some things.

893
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,360
I am going there to receive Hu Shi, Hu Shizhi.

894
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,520
Then, you're not going to see the two boys at Shanghai?

895
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000
Then when I bump into them, I'll meet them.

896
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,640
So, bumping into them means should still buy some things.

897
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,640
Come, come here and fry something for the two.

898
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,080
I'll hurry up and go.

899
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,680
Don't buy too much, okay?

900
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,200
I only have one suitcase, not bringing much.

901
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,400
Alright, just one luggage.

902
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:49,065
[Shanghai]

903
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,640
Zhongfu, why did take so many bags?

904
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,800
Big bags, small bundles, are you escaping from a famine?

905
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,920
Gao Junman!

906
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,200
I already said I'm only bringing one bag.

907
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,880
All of a sudden, she managed to pack five!

908
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,400
Just for the two punks

909
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,840
to have food, clothes, drinks and tools!

910
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,920
She's almost moved the whole Qianmen pavilion over.

911
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,680
Junman is also very good to the children.

912
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,600
This... this suitcase.

913
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,760
There's still give more bags.

914
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,960
It seems there's eight bags.

915
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,120
Anyways, there's already this many, and I'm not lacking those few.

916
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,400
I'll add another three bags.

917
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,600
Where's Hu Shi?

918
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,736
He went back home.

919
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:21,778
He went back home?

920
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,080
It's like this. His mother has gotten ill all of a sudden.

921
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,160
Yesterday morning a telegram arrived

922
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,760
in the afternoon he hurried back.

923
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,520
He had me tell you

924
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,560
wait for him to finish handling his family maters, then he'll go to Beijing to hold the teaching position.

925
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,680
As a matter of fact, yesterday

926
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,960
I still wanted to give you a telegram.

927
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,480
You were already on the road, though.

928
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,240
Where are Qiaonian, Yannian?

929
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,280
At Aurora University.

930
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,800
Then I'm going to Jixi, to look for Shizhi.

931
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,640
What are you going to Jixi for?

932
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,080
Someone went back home to handle private matters.

933
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,680
If you go, won't you give people an inconvenience?

934
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,680
How about this. You help me take these bags

935
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,800
to go to Aurora University

936
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,320
and give these things over to Yannian and Qiaonian.

937
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,680
Otherwise these things will go bad.

938
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,800
D-d-don't go.

939
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,080
You also don't need to go to the school.

940
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,600
I'll talk to the two

941
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,120
and get them to come see you.

942
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
Then what did I come here for?

943
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,120
Don't be so anxious, listen to me.

944
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,240
There's two friends, they heard you came to Shanghai.

945
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,840
Wants to urgently come see you.

946
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,480
Who?

947
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,200
Yi Baisha, Zou Yongcheng.

948
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,880
They're in Shanghai?

949
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,360
They are in Shanghai.

950
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,360
Brother Zhongfu!

951
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,560
Yongcheng!

952
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,840
Zhongfu.

953
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,360
I missed you, Zhongfu.

954
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,240
Is everything alright you guys?

955
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,160
Hurry and sit.

956
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,080
Here.

957
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,600
You guys... how did you guys get together?

958
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
Zhongfu.

959
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
My unit got dissolved.

960
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,680
[Zou Yongcheng, styled Qizhi]

961
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,760
Right now I'm in the provincial military governor's office, working as an advisor.

962
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,800
Honestly, there's really nothing to do.

963
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,120
As a matter of fact, Baisha was at Hunan teaching.

964
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,280
Us two often group up to drink our sorrows away.

965
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,611
[Yi Baisha, styled Yuecun, Scholar of the New Culture Movement]

966
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,480
Coming back this time, is to procure arms for the Hunan army.

967
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,480
He is my advisor.

968
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,200
Baisha, you, this master,

969
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,400
why are you also playing with firearms?

970
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
Why can't I be playing with firearms?

971
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,320
You also once followed Mr. Cai Yuanpei.

972
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,520
Didn't you make a bomb?

973
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,000
Baisha.

974
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,240
Is there a matter you are not happy with?

975
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,240
He went to Guangzhou and saw Mr. [Sun] Yat-sen who returned.

976
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,280
What did Mr. [Sun] Yat-sen say to you?

977
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,960
Warlords.

978
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,760
Defeat the warlords.

979
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,400
Defeat the warlords. Easier said than done.

980
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,480
How many warlords are there in China?

981
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
Which warlord

982
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,520
does not have a foreign power behind him?

983
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,600
Fortunately, Europe at war.

984
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,680
Otherwise,

985
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,040
they would've divided China up early on.

986
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,440
Lamentable, so lamentable.

987
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,440
Such a big country like this

988
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,120
unexpectedly we don't have a unifying leader.

989
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,600
These warlords, each and every one,

990
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
has an ugly appearance of "as soon as you finish singing, I go on stage".

991
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,720
Creating a foul atmosphere and causing everything to be in disarray.

992
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,080
Leaving people bitterly disappointed.

993
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,840
In the eyes of these warlords

994
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,760
Mr. [Sun] Yat-sen is actually just a figurehead.

995
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,640
The founder of the Republic.

996
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
The leader of the revolutionaries.

997
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,800
Recognized around the world.

998
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,640
The Chinese people's key figure

999
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,120
right now in each and every warlord

1000
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,280
is being played with in the palm of their hands.

1001
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:28,973
Suffering time and time again.

1002
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,960
This country is finished.
