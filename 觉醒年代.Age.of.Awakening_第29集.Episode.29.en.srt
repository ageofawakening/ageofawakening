[The Age of Awakening]

00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:05,346
[Episode Twenty-nine]

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,800
Brother Zhongfu, think about it 

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,560
Without the alarm clock

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,080
Day and night, with all my heart and soul.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,240
The night follows the eyes, and the heart drips coffee and hoofs sound.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,240
There will be no bomb.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,160
Although the bomb is powerful

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,520
But it can't overcome people's inertia after all.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Only the alarm clock is needed.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,240
Constantly reminding and persisting.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,520
To finally wake everyone up.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,600
Two gentlemen

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,560
新港他

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,000
He's dying.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,280
Take us there quickly.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,040
Xingang

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,680
sir

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,200
Xingang

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,960
Sir is here.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,480
Don't move.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,880
It's okay. I can

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,400
I'm fine

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,000
Two gentlemen

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,400
I want to say goodbye to you forever.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
Xingang, the biggest koo in my life

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
I just met two gentlemen. 

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
Unfortunately, the country is endangered.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,000
But the authorities fought the rabbit with the lion's strength. 

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Play against our patriotism.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
It makes me feel that in my own country.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
Be bullied as much as Japan.

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,680
What hope is there for such a country

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,880
Two gentlemen

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520
You have to save this country.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
Save this nation.

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,760
sir

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,480
Do you remember

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,320
At the beginning we

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,080
First meeting

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
I vomited a mouthful of phlegm on you. 

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,440
This is my bad temper.

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
Xingang

44
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,680
You are a hero of the country.

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,680
You are this country.

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,840
Example of youth

47
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,840
orchid

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm sorry

49
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,120
I can't take care of you anymore.

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
After I die.

51
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,640
You're going to put my ashes

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
Take it back to my hometown in Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao.

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Buried with my father.

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
When China takes back Qingdao.

55
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,000
You're going to my grave

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,840
Tell me and my father

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,280
orchid

58
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,480
Stop crying.

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,400
Stop crying.

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,880
I feel my hair has turned black.

61
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,960
yes or no 

62
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,240
Haiwei

63
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,080
Shiyan

64
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,080
Zhongxia

65
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,280
Look

66
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,120
It's black.

67
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,680
Hei

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,520
It's black.

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,680
Hei

70
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,000
Hei

71
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,680
Guo

72
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,160
Xingang

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,720
Xingang

74
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,920
Xingang

75
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,880
Wake up, Guo

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,920
Xingang, wake up

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,080
Guo

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,280
Xingang

79
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,080
Guo, wake up

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,200
Xingang

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,760
Guo Xingang

82
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,200
史鸷吾弟

83
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
A few days above Shanghai

84
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
Jingshi has been a thousand years old.

85
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,520
In the past few days since you left Beijing

86
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
He Peking University

87
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Great changes have taken place. 

88
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,680
May 4

89
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,400
Destined to be one of the greatest 

90
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
An important milestone. 

91
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,680
4

92
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,720
Thirteen schools, mainly Peking University.

93
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,440
More than three thousand students marched in the streets. 

94
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,720
Request to refuse to sign the Paris Peace Treaty

95
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
Severely punish traitors

96
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
Defend China's sovereignty.

97
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,160
This shocked China and the whole world.

98
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,520
The reactionaries sent a large number of military police.

99
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
And arrested 32 students.

100
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,280
Arouse strong opposition from the whole society

101
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
All classes are taking action.

102
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,200
To the 7th.

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,880
The reactionary government had to release the arrested students.

104
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
The struggle won a staged victory. 

105
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,600
of course

106
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,520
This also requires sacrifice.

107
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,480
My student Guo Xingang died today.

108
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
Please tell Yannian this news.

109
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,880
They are good friends.

110
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,400
I don't know if Secretary Ji's presence is far from welcome.

111
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going to find President Cai.

112
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,400
No, no, no

113
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't disturb principal Cai.

114
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,920
You two go ahead and get busy.

115
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,680
Headquarters order

116
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,160
Transfer bail students to court for trial

117
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,600
Make Peking University immediately rectify the style of study.

118
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Director Li

119
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,640
You should give it to President Cai in person. 

120
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,160
You also know

121
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
I am just an errand boy.

122
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,280
Have no right to accept such orders!

123
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
Hold

124
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,920
That's just for show.

125
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,680
There are three orders in this order. 

126
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,200
The first is to investigate Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University.

127
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,640
This one was crossed out by Chief Fu privately.

128
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
So say this command

129
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,080
It can never be handed over to Cai Yuanpei.

130
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
Understand?

131
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,120
Brother Feng is promoted to a high position.

132
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
So that we can come to this first-class Qingyin class.

133
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,640
Congratulations

134
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
Recommended by Director Wu

135
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
My brother is now "Gazette"

136
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,720
Editor-in-Chief of Xuehai Chunqiu

137
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
This is my public identity.

138
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,080
My other identity is

139
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,840
Senior detective compiled by Beijing Metropolitan Police Department. 

140
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,280
It was also personally led by Director Wu Bingxiang.

141
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
Deputy leader of the second intelligence group

142
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,680
My job is to collect

143
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,680
Dynamic information of Beijing academic circles

144
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,240
Track and disrupt the student movement.

145
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,800
from this day onwards

146
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
This Lanxiangban

147
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,720
It is a point where we meet.

148
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
All of you.

149
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
They are all my informants.

150
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,720
However, Brother Fengzai

151
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
But I heard that this "Gazette" one

152
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
Xuehai Chunqiu

153
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,640
That's to support the student movement.

154
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
The government went against it.

155
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,840
this

156
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,720
I'm afraid it's not consistent with our behavior.

157
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
That's a good question

158
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,560
dual identity

159
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
This is the characteristic of our intelligence work.

160
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,360
Only when you go deep into the tiger's den can you get a miraculous effect.

161
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,920
In the future, as informants of the metropolitan police department.

162
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,240
You should also learn to hide your identity.

163
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,200
By the way, everybody.

164
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
Informants don't make money for nothing.

165
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,640
As long as you guys are diligent enough

166
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,640
Guiwan nawu

167
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
It will be our home in the future.

168
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,320
Zhanggongzi

169
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,520
Hurry up

170
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,880
The dishes are all cold.

171
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
Sister Liu

172
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
Girl, are you ready

173
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,960
Walk

174
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,440
classmates

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,720
classmates

176
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,760
Everybody gather around.

177
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,480
classmates

178
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,520
Come and have a look.

179
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,400
classmates

180
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,400
Has everyone heard?

181
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
President Cai Yuanpei Cai 

182
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,440
Sell our Peking University.

183
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,720
Mr. Cai

184
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,520
impossible

185
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,960
Mr Cai, how is it possible?

186
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,400
Students "Students

187
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,120
classmates

188
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,760
Listen to me.

189
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
Cai Yuanpei asked us to resume classes.

190
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
Said it was to protect those arrested classmates.

191
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,280
But actually?

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,840
Look

193
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,680
Those arrested classmates

194
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Aren't you still being interrogated and sentenced?

195
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,320
This is obviously

196
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,600
He set a trap.

197
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,600
We were all cheated by him.

198
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,360
No way!

199
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,160
classmates

200
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,200
classmates

201
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,720
I can hear it.

202
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
This is Cao Rulin, but it costs a lot of money to hire a district. 

203
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,200
To assassinate Cai Yuanpei and Peking University students

204
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,000
Xu Shuzheng has set up a cannon in Jingshan

205
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,440
To shell Peking University

206
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,520
Students, wake up.

207
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,120
Don't let Cai Yuanpei fool you.

208
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,200
Ah, amazing!

209
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,200
The magazine effect run by Zhongfu has already appeared.

210
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,680
My vernacular novels have also worked.

211
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,440
The May 4th Movement swept away the tacky slavery of the people. 

212
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,400
Be petty.

213
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,160
Hold up the backbone of the Chinese people

214
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,280
That's amazing.

215
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,240
yes

216
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,520
Yu just said it thoroughly.

217
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
After the May Fourth Student Parade

218
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,280
All of a sudden, over the years

219
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,480
All the contradictions have risen.

220
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
Patriotism or selling pressure

221
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,120
Now it is in front of the Chinese people.

222
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,160
Daofenling

223
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,400
No one can get around where to go. 

224
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,640
But according to my analysis

225
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,000
The situation in these two days

226
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,680
More subtle than the previous two days.

227
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,240
Although it is said that the arrested students 

228
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,960
Was released.

229
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,720
But the contradiction is more acute.

230
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,560
Fu warlord

231
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,400
Want to borrow the students to resume classes

232
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,040
And canceling the National Assembly.

233
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:05,840
The first one

234
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:06,960
sign a contract

235
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,320
The second piece

236
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,760
Suppress the student movement

237
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,480
The reason why they are so thousands

238
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,920
Just want to show 

239
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,080
Ruling power over Chinese political power

240
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,400
So if you want to do these two things

241
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,920
The most critical

242
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
Is to subdue the leader of Peking University first.

243
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,520
Who is the leader of Peking University?

244
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,880
Cai Yuanpei

245
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,240
Then this is the reactionaries.

246
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
Now the primary target of attack

247
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,960
Shouchang's analysis is very reasonable

248
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,640
As far as I know

249
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,640
The police department has issued a summons today. 

250
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,480
To subpoena those people separately

251
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,000
The arrested students who have been released.

252
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,920
Still claim to be investigated according to law 

253
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Their legal responsibility

254
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,840
in addition

255
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,040
presidential palace

256
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,000
the State Council

257
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,720
Ministry of Education

258
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,480
Instructions have been issued.

259
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,400
To reprimand Mr Cai Yuanpei for taking up his post.

260
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,840
I see and hear.

261
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,800
The Anfu family has already defined Hu Renyuan.

262
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,080
Replace Mr Cai Yuanpei as the president of Peking University.

263
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,640
Mr Cai seems to be in a bad mood recently.

264
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
I called him this morning.

265
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,280
Want to see him?

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,880
He was rejected.

267
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,840
Mr. Cai

268
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,960
Mr. Cai

269
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,840
寿昌兄

270
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,640
beautiful

271
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,200
Please sit down.

272
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,360
I came to see you. 

273
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
You have something on your mind.

274
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,120
The police sent another summons. 

275
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,960
Arrested students

276
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,440
Trying to convict them.

277
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Once these students are caught in the picture again

278
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,920
The possible consequences are unimaginable.

279
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,360
Are all young talents.

280
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
full of youthful spirit

281
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Duan Qirui played a legal card. 

282
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,800
It is very deceptive.

283
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
Mr. Cai

284
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,800
We have to make a good plan.

285
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,040
I've thought it over.

286
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
Didn't come up with a good intention either.

287
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Sir, Chairman Wang Da is here.

288
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,040
please

289
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,120
People!

290
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
I've come to apologize to you.

291
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,520
Brother Botang, what are you doing?

292
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,480
Now I'm a cat on hot bricks.

293
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,640
You're still joking with me.

294
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,120
come

295
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
来唐波兄弟请坐吧

296
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
请坐寿昌兄

297
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:40,960
to be frank/honest with you

298
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,040


299
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,920
Disreality

300
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
Duan Qirui summoned me in the afternoon.

301
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
Explicit diplomatic association

302
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,280
May not interfere with the Paris Peace Conference signing.

303
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,840
No domestic assembly shall be convened.

304
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,960
Do not spread opinions different from those of the government.

305
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,120
He also said

306
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,000
What 15,000 students in Beijing did. 

307
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,960
The culprit is Peking University No.1 School. 

308
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
And the culprit of Peking University No.1 School

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,560
In the headmaster Cai Zimin

310
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,120
Cai Min can no longer be the president of Peking University. 

311
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,680
He has called Xu Shichang.

312
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,600
Propose Hu Renyuan to replace Cai Yuanpei.

313
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
President of Peking University 

314
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,480
Tian Huang replaced Fu Zengxiang as the education chief. 

315
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,600
In a few days, it will be submitted to the cabinet for agreement.

316
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
They don't have to bother.

317
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,560
I have submitted my resignation report three times.

318
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,480
What matters now is

319
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,840
Can't let the arrested students suffer again.

320
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,640
We can't let them go back to prison again.

321
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,960
People?

322
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,720
I think about it.

323
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,400
If we take a long-term view. 

324
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,880
Is there any way to avoid this robbery?

325
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
我说实话唐波兄弟

326
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,520
As long as I, the students of Peking University

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,520
Don't suffer again.

328
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,160
As long as my Peking University is safe. 

329
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,320
Let me Cai Yuanpei do what?

330
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,560
I'll do whatever it takes.

331
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,560
The present situation

332
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,640
There's only one way.

333
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,960
Thirty-Six Stratagems

334
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,800
decamping being the best

335
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,960
leave

336
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,640
leave

337
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
Uncle Shen

338
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,960
I want to ask you a question.

339
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,240
You say

340
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,680
You said it was going to rain, and Mom was going to get married.

341
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,280
Who is this mother talking about?

342
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,560
I thought.

343
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
The mother who wants to marry

344
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
She is by no means a child's mother

345
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,760
It should be an unmarried girl.

346
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,160
Recently, I saw Wang Youguang's of Qing Dynasty.

347
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,160
Wu Xia Yan Lian

348
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,560


349
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
It's going to rain and my mother is going to get married.

350
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,680
This is how he explained it.

351
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,120
He said heaven.

352
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
Pure yang without yin 

353
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,600
If it's going to rain, it's yang, but it's yin.

354
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,480
Niang?

355
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,800
It's solitary yin without yang.

356
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
If you want to marry, you will seek yang from yin. 

357
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,640
If you go ahead, you will rot like a pulp.

358
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,000
This is what it is, this is what it is. 

359
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,320
Look at this Wang Youguang

360
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
He said this married mother.

361
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,200
Is an unmarried woman. 

362
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,480
If it's a married woman

363
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
It can't be secluded.

364
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,520
The so-called "when a man is married, a woman is married"

365
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,920
My daughter is too old to stay.

366
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,400
Stay, stay, stay, be enemies.

367
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,440
It's humane that mother wants to get married.

368
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,280
It's going to rain

369
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,040
It's heaven

370
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
Heaven and humanity are both irresistible.

371
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,320
Gu Sheng, please show us this.

372
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
What do you mean?

373
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,840
I just want to tell you.

374
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,840
I just want to tell you.

375
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
If you want to go, it must go.

376
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,360
What should be left will be left.

377
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,480
This is independent of human will.

378
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,280
Come and see!

379
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,720
Why did Mr. Cai run away?

380
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,160
Doesn't he put oil on his feet?

381
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,040
He slipped away first. 

382
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,440
Sir is here.

383
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,760
Yes, sir.

384
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm tired

385
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
Junma slayer goes by the way.

386
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,160
People work hard to stop steam, but take a break.

387
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
I want a little rest.

388
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,840
Peking University has officially resigned as principal.

389
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
Assemble with other related schools.

390
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,360
Since May 9th

391
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
Break away from everything.

392
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,160
Hereby declare

393
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
Only those who know me forgive me. 

394
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,480
Three gentlemen, Mr. Cai left this note

395
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,840
What exactly does it mean?

396
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,360
Now there are all kinds of explanations.

397
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
You are the authority.

398
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
Tell us all about it.

399
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,560
Yes, sir. Tell us about it.

400
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,080
Are you a liberal arts student?

401
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:34,880
be

402
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,560
Can't you understand this? 

403
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,200
We can understand ourselves by living.

404
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,520
We can understand everything.

405
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,000
Words we can understand.

406
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,200
But what about this truth?

407
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,040
classmates

408
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,320
classmates

409
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,960
Listen to me.

410
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,560
Look

411
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,240
Mr. Cai

412
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,880
Mr. Cai

413
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,160
The beginning of this note

414
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,080
On the two allusions.

415
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,520
If we want to understand Mr Cai's mind

416
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
We must first know these two allusions.

417
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,520
Look at this allusion.

418
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
Junma slayer goes by the way.

419
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,160
It comes from what should be written in Han Dynasty. 

420
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,520
Common sense of custom

421
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,880
Its original text is

422
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
Long horse fat

423
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
The watcher's swift move is also sudden.

424
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,960
Take advantage of his words.

425
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
Drive away endlessly

426
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,440
As for Rui's death

427
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,480
As for death

428
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:24,560


429
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:24,640


430
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:24,800


431
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,920
Mr. Gu

432
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,440
not get a thing out of

433
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
You'd better tell us the vernacular.

434
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,560
Yes, sir.

435
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:30,960
Yes, sir.

436
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,320
You'd better talk to us.

437
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,160
Look at you, a liberal arts student

438
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
It's just learning without being proficient.

439
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
The meaning of this allusion is

440
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,080
There is an officer.

441
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,400
His horse is fattened and runs fast. 

442
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,560
Be praised by passers-by 

443
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,680
What about this rider? 

444
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
I began to gloat.

445
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
He is riding his horse and whipping his whip to keep running. 

446
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,880
As a result, this horse was exhausted.

447
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,320
So Mr Cai quoted this allusion.

448
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,920
What exactly does it mean?

449
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,960
Don't worry.

450
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,760
There is a second story.

451
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,840
The people have been working hard enough

452
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,360
Kexiaoxiu

453
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,440
It comes from The Book of Songs Daya. 

454
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,160
People's Labor

455
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,320
Its second sentence begins with 

456
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,320
The people have been working hard enough

457
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,840
Kexiaoxiu

458
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,840
To caress the people of the king's capital

459
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,440
Think people

460
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,200
Tang Gong 'a

461
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,120
You can talk about it.

462
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,320
Off topic.

463
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,680
Students mean to ask you.

464
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,280
Mr. Cai, what does this note mean?

465
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,280
The student

466
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,880
Let me tell you.

467
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
This killer of your horse is on the way.

468
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,760
This gentleman refers to the municipal government.

469
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,520
This Maya

470
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,120
Refers to Cao Rulin and Zhang Zongxiang.

471
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,960
This roadside.

472
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,880
It's about you students.

473
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
Cai Yuanpei means

474
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
You students are in trouble.

475
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,920
He had to run away.

476
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,200
It can't be true

477
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,280
Feiye

478
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,080


479
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,920
This is for Master Cai.

480
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,240
classmates

481
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,920
I thought the monarch meant your classmates.

482
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,560
Ma also refers to Master Cai himself.

483
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,000
As for the roadside.

484
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,360
That's the damn Paris peace treaty.

485
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,000
And traitor Cao Zhanglu.

486
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,880
The reason why Master Cai ran away 

487
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,040
He was completely victimized by an adulterer.

488
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,240
He did this.

489
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
May be out of necessity.

490
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,640
It may also be a delaying tactic.

491
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
But I believe Gu Hongming.

492
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
Master Cai will never abandon Peking University.

493
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,960
Good point!

494
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,080
It's going to rain and my mother is going to get married.

495
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,120
Suck It Up

496
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,320
Selling newspapers!Selling newspapers!

497
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,400


498
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,600
Selling newspapers!Selling newspapers!

499
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,080
Cai Yuanpei left school.

500
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,960
Leave a mysterious note

501
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,080
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

502
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,800
Sir, buy a newspaper.

503
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
Cai Yuanpei left school.

504
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Left a mysterious note

505
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,960
Selling newspapers!Selling newspapers!

506
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
The sacrifice was forced away by the government.

507
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,360
To save the students.

508
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,280
I had to resign.

509
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,480
He can only turn to him if he goes through contradictions.

510
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
Students can be rescued. 

511
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,680
Fair enough. That's right.

512
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,480
The reason why Mr. Cai left without saying goodbye 

513
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,320
One is to protect students.

514
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,640
Second, so that we can't compromise

515
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,520
Keep fighting.

516
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,880
The armed forces can seize the division.

517
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,880
Even an ordinary person has his unchangeable ambitions 

518
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,480
Mr. Ji is not here.

519
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
Just in time for all of us to let go 

520
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,080
put into practice or action

521
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,160
I think our immediate priority.

522
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,760
When you want to carry out the Cai movement.

523
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,040
Not just Peking University.

524
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,640
It's the whole of Beijing

525
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,400
Even the whole of China.

526
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,360
Pinch the government with Mr. Cai 

527
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,040
In this way, the government can't take care of students.

528
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,080
Let's discuss how to do it specifically.

529
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,800
Yes, or please ask the Federation of Students to organize.

530
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,640
It's not enough for the Federation of Students to come forward. 

531
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,400
The direct target of the Cai movement is the government. 

532
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
Then the teacher should take the lead.

533
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I think we should get in touch right now. 

534
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,480
Chen Baoquan of Beijing Normal School

535
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,920
He took the lead.

536
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,200
And the organization was established.

537
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,880
Beijing Federation of School Staff 

538
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,400
Negotiate with the government

539
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,000
Get ready at this time.

540
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
Combine protest speeches and speeches.

541
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,640
Go deep into all levels of society.

542
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
Let all China move.

543
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,800
If you really can't, come to him for a general strike. 

544
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,240
I propose

545
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,320
By Peking University professor jointly to the Ministry of Education.

546
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,200
Write a statement.

547
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
Show that Peking University teachers and students

548
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,400
Vow to advance and retreat with President Cai

549
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,880
Ask the Ministry of Education to retain Cai Yuanpei.

550
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,800
If Cai Yuanpei does not stay.

551
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,360
Then all the professors of Peking University unanimously resigned.

552
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,440
If you have no objection. 

553
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,000
I volunteered to draft this statement.

554
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,640
good

555
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Then I'll get someone to sign it

556
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,040
When I came here just now

557
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,400
I also met Gu Hongming and Liu Shipei.

558
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
They all specifically mentioned it to me.

559
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
If there is any action.

560
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,720
Be sure to inform them.

561
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,600
We will certainly win the overwhelming support.

562
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,160
Then everyone should do their job.

563
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,040
Act now

564
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:17,600


565
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:19,680
2

566
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,000
The president's office just called.

567
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,880
Say Chen Baoquan Tanger and wait for eighteen people.

568
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,760
Principals of colleges and universities above secondary level in Beijing collectively wrote a letter. 

569
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
Suspend the Qing government to retain Cai Yuanpei 

570
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
We are ordered to pay close attention.

571
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
Teachers in universities and colleges

572
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,240
Petition of all professors of Peking University

573
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,360
You will forward it to Prime Minister Qian immediately.

574
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
Those official documents on the desk

575
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,240
Please also handle it together.

576
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,240
I have to go now./I'm leaving now.

577
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,800
The chief

578
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,200
The chief

579
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
This seat is not for people.

580
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm going to follow Cai Yuanpei's example and walk away.

581
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,840
Don't look for me.

582
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
You can't find me either.

583
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,720
Chief, you're gone.

584
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,400
What can we do about this mess?

585
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
It's going to rain and my mother is going to get married.

586
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,920
Suck It Up

587
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,680
cabinet minister

588
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,640
cabinet minister

589
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,360
Get you two here today. 

590
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,960
Just want to discuss it.

591
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,840
The problems of the Ministry of Education and Peking University

592
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
It's been shaking for half a month. 

593
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,160
Student unrest is a wave of unrest.

594
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,040
This makes me dizzy.

595
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,760
sit

596
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,280
Cai Yuanpei ran away

597
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,160
Make all the principals in Beijing resign.

598
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,440
It's a last resort

599
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,800
I just issued a retention order. 

600
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
I didn't expect this Fu Zengxiang.

601
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
I also left without saying goodbye.

602
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,440
It has evaporated for several days. 

603
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,200
Now students are noisy in the street every day.

604
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,880
I heard it was returned.

605
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,480
People are dead.

606
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,400
Premier Qian, tell me about the situation.

607
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,520
A graduate of higher education in Tsinghua the day before yesterday.

608
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,320
Overworked and killed during the speech.

609
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,120
A graduate of the former Jingshi University Hall yesterday. 

610
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,200
Throwing himself in Taiping Lake

611
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,240
Left a highly provocative suicide note.

612
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,800
Director Wu is worried that students will use this suicide note.

613
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
In the past two days, police forces have been deployed around the school. 

614
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,880
Afraid of an accident

615
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,360
This student thing can't be solved.

616
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,160
You have no good days anywhere.

617
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,800
Guys, tell me what to do.

618
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,880
You want me to say it?

619
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,040
The root is that we are too soft.

620
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,840
Fu Zengxiang

621
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,480
He said that only appeasement can prevent an accident. 

622
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,640
Now it's appeasing the trouble.

623
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,520
He ran away by himself.

624
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,160
This kind of person can't accomplish enough, but can do more.

625
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,480
And Wu Bingxiang, an idiot.

626
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,480
We have to release all the students we have caught. 

627
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,840
Are you silly now?

628
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,440
These people who can read and write characters.

629
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,280
Is to look at people's faces.

630
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,960
If you are soft, he will be hard.

631
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,800
He is soft when you are hard.

632
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,600
Premier Qian 1, what do you think?

633
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,520
I think the root of this matter is still in Paris.

634
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,760
The matter of the peace treaty is not resolved.

635
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,920
Students' affairs can't be solved

636
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
One yard is one yard.

637
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,720
What if we solve the students' problems first? 

638
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,080
I have no choice.

639
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,480
I listen to the president.

640
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,000
President Qing's instructions

641
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,200
Well, let me tell you something. 

642
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,760
I discussed it with Lao Duan recently.

643
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,840
The two of us have drawn up several articles.

644
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,560
first

645
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,840
Fu Zengxiang, chief of education, was relieved of his post as chief of staff.

646
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,520
Tian Yinghuang replaced it.

647
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,240
Reject Cao Rulin Zhang Zongxiang

648
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,400
Lu Zongyu's resignation application

649
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,840
Continue to reuse

650
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,480
Thirdly, in view of Cai Yuanpei's resignation.

651
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,440
Hu Renyuan is in charge of Peking University temporarily.

652
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,560
Fourth, instruct garrison headquarters to be reincarnated.

653
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,840
Step by step to command the Metropolitan Police Department.

654
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,840
Seriously protect the security of Beijing.

655
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,520
Those who refuse to accept the pressure in case of correcting troubles.

656
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,960
Arrest and punish according to law

657
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,600
fifth

658
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,120
Trial the students who caused trouble on May 4th according to law.

659
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,720
Great president wise

660
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,640
Gentlemen, Master Ge, here they come.

661
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,280
Mr. Chen

662
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,520
sir

663
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
We represent thousands of workers in Changxindian.

664
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,000
To mourn the martyrs who died for their country.

665
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,680
When I came

666
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,440
The workmates asked me to give you a message.

667
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,480
We must not let the current asshole government

668
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
Lost Qingdao.

669
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,000
If Xu Shichang dares to betray his country

670
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,840
Our workers resolutely refuse to agree.

671
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,520
thank you

672
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,040
Sir, this is the decision just made by the Federation of Students.

673
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,320
Please sit down for a while.

674
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,880
Be busy first.

675
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,560
Who have you been to Qingdao

676
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,680
Is Qingdao beautiful?

677
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,560
I've never been there once. 

678
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
Xingang promised me that 

679
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,960
After graduation

680
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,720
Take me back to my hometown in Qingdao.

681
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,840
Marry me?

682
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,440
He also told me 

683
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,120
Said there was a trestle in Qingdao.

684
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,560
It's just a long, long bridge

685
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
It's over a hundred meters.

686
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,280
All the way to the sea.

687
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,320
He said to go to the end of the bridge.

688
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,240
You can see a white lighthouse.

689
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,360
Especially nice.

690
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,600
Xingang also laughed at me and said

691
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
I am a girl.

692
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,160
I dare not walk on the trestle by myself.

693
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,960
Because sometimes the wind is very strong and the waves are very big.

694
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,360
A wave came and hit me into the sea.

695
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,280
新港还说

696
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,360
If I fall into the water

697
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,360
He certainly won't save me.

698
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,680
He stood on the trestle and laughed.

699
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,840
I choke on water.

700
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,560
Let me learn to swim by myself.

701
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
Jenny, why is he so bad?

702
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,920
done

703
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,240
Good boy

704
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,520
stop crying

705
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,840
stop crying

706
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,680
alright

707
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,680
Good boy

708
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,880
Stop crying.

709
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,320
Good boy

710
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,160
白兰跟刘梅一起

711
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,080
Move to the house.

712
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
Go to France to work and study together.

713
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,680
You're gone.

714
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,160
Bring blood to Qingdao.

715
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,240
come

716
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,840
Wulaiye

717
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,840
No wild slaves can shake Mount Tai.

718
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,920
mount

719
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:44,640


720
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:44,880


721
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,440


722
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,560
Saving the nation and learning

723
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,920
Ripe, light, big and small.

724
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,560
be self-evident

725
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,120
Is inseparable from the fate of the individual and the country.

726
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,640
Now I understand this movement.

727
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
In addition to letting the people act directly

728
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
Beyond directly solving the problem

729
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,680
Add two more words.

730
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,880
No impossible victory.

731
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,160
Teachers and students.

732
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,120
Guo Xingang loves this country.

733
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
Gave his precious life.

734
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
He is our Peking University.

735
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,520
Beijing academic circles

736
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,480
Even the glory and pride of the whole of China.

737
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,840
We will never forget him. 

738
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,040
We're going to use Guo Xingang's death

739
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,960
Awaken the people

740
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,640
Inherit its ambition

741
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,200
Complete its unfinished business

742
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,880
So we decided

743
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,080
Here on the afternoon of May 18th. 

744
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,800
Hold a memorial meeting for Guo Xingang martyrs.

745
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,480
Meanwhile, I declare

746
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,840
Schools above secondary school in Beijing

747
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,440
students'federation

748
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,480
Beijing School Staff Federation

749
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,160
Resolution of the meeting

750
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,120
In order to resist the perverse actions of Beiyang government 

751
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,720
It is decided that from May 19th

752
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,280
All schools in Beijing

753
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,640
General strike

754
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,680
This is left by Xingang's blood. 

755
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,440
Let's observe silence for Xingang.

756
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,960
Strike and protest and preach to mobilize the masses.

757
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,920
band together

758
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,800
Civilian education lecture group

759
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,840
To play a greater role.

760
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,960
You have to make a plan. 

761
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,960
Not only should we go deep into all classes in Beijing.

762
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,760
Even deeper.

763
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,520
Shanghai, Jinan and Changsha

764
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,640
These big cities

765
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
Win the support of the whole country

766
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,360
And in these big cities 

767
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,040
Also hold Guo Xingang's memorial service

768
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,720
This is the best way to mobilize the masses.

769
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,480
I'm going to Changsha in a few days.

770
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,920
I heard Mao Zedong and them are over there.

771
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,120
Make a splash.

772
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm going to learn from them.

773
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,920
Make a horizontal alliance.

774
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,040
Especially Shanghai.

775
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,400
That is the gathering place of the working class.

776
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,560
Let Shanghai become a student movement

777
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,440
The second center

778
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,720
Even play a greater role.

779
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
I went to Shanghai to preach Guo Xingang.

780
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,280
good

781
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,960
Then we'll prepare more propaganda groups for the south.

782
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:11,920
good

783
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,840
Yannian Qiaonian

784
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,200
I'm going to take a job with you.

785
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,960
I just wrote an article.

786
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,440
The title is

787
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,120
"Inform all sides about the Shandong issue"

788
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,040
This article is written for the general strike tomorrow.

789
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,480
Mainly want to tell you honestly.

790
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,640
Don't think that the Shandong problem

791
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,480
It's just a matter of the survival of a province.

792
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,800
It's not just a matter of academic circles.

793
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,240
But the whole of China.
