00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,240
that kept ringing constantly and never stopped,

Although the bomb is powerful,

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,520
it can't overcome people's inertia after all.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Only the alarm clock

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,240
keeps ringing, keeps reminding, keeps watching

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,520
to finally wake everyone up.

14

He's dying.

17

Don't move.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,400
I want to say goodbye to you forever.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
The greatest honor of my life

28

is to know you two gentlemen.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
Unfortunately, the country is danger.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,000
But the authorities fought with the strength of a lion

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
to crush our patriotism.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
It makes me feel bullied in my own country

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
as much as in Japan.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,680
What hope is there for such a country?

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,880
Sir,

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520

do you remember?

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,320
When we

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,080
first met,

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
I spat a mouthful of spit on you.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,440
This was my bad temper.

88
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080

from thirteen schools, mainly Peking University,

94

more than three thousand students marched in the streets

95
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,720
demanding the refusal to sign the Paris Peace Treaty,

96
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
to severely punish the traitors,

97
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
and to defend China's sovereignty.

98
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,160
This shocked China and the whole world.

99
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,520
The reactionaries sent a large number of military police

100
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
to beat and to arrest 32 students,

101
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,280
arousing strong opposition from the whole of society.

102

Of course,

107
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,520

Headquarters' orders.

117
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:42,680

Order Peking University to rectify their academic culture immediately.

121
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Director Li,

122
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,640
you should give it to President Cai in person.

123
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,160
You also know,

124
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
I am just an errand boy.

125
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,280
I have no right to accept such orders.

126
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
Take it.

127
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,920
That's just for show.

128
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,680
There are three instructions in this order.

129
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,200
The first is to investigate Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University.

130
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,640
This one was crossed out by Minister Fu privately.

131
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
So you can say that this order

132
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,080
can never be handed over to Cai Yuanpei.

133
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
Understand?

134
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,120
I've been promoted to a high position.

135
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
So that we can come to this first-class Qingyin class.

136
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,640
Congratulations!

editor-in-Chief of "Learning from Overseas".

140
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
This is my public identity.

141
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,080
My other identity is

142
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,840
senior detective of the Beijing Metropolitan Police Department,

143
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,280
also personally led by Director Wu Bingxiang

144
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
as deputy leader of the second intelligence group.

145
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,680
My job is to collect

146
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,680
information on the dynamics of the academic community in Beijing

147
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,240
to track and disrupt the student movement.

148
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,800
From this day onwards,

149
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
This Lanxiangban

150
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,720
is a point where we meet.

151
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
All of you

152
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
are my informants.

153
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,720
However, brother Fengzai

154
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
I heard that this "Gazette"

155
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
and the "Xuehai Chunqiu"

156
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,640
support the student movement.

157
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
The government is going against them.

158
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,840
It's-

159
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,720
I'm afraid it's not consistent with our behavior.

160
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
That's a good question.

161
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,560
Dual identity.

162
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
This is the characteristic of our intelligence work.

163
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,360
Only when you go deep into the tiger's den can you get miraculous results.

164
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,920
In the future, as informants of the metropolitan police department,

165
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,240
you should also learn to hide your identity.

166
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,200
By the way, everybody,

167
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
informants don't make money for nothing.

168
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,640
As long as you guys are diligent enough,

169
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,640
Guijuilian

170
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
will be our home in the future.

171
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,320
Master Zhang.

172
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,520
Hurry up.

173
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,880
The dishes are all cold.

174
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
Sister Liu!

175
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
Girl, are you ready?

176
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,960
Let's go!

177
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,440
Students!

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,720
Students!

179
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,760
Everybody gather around!

Come and have a look.

187
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,520
Impossible.

188
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,960
Mr. Cai, how is that possible?

189
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,400
Students! Students!

190
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,120
Students!

191
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,760

He said it was to protect those arrested classmates.

194

But actually?

Look!

The students who were arrested

197

were still tried and sentenced, weren't they?

198

This is obviously

199
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,600
a trap he laid.

200
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,600
We were all cheated by him.

to attack Cai Yuanpei and Peking University students.

[Lu Xun, Civil servant under the Ministry of Education]

and petty feelings of the people

217

in one fell swoop, all the contradictions

225
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,120
is now a watershed in front of

226

the Chinese people.

227
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,400
No one can get around these two paths.

228
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,640

the situation in these two days

230
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,680
have become more subtle than the previous two days.

231
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,240
Although it is said that the arrested students

232
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,960
was released,

233
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,720

241
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,480
The reason why they do this

242
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,920
is to show their dominance

243
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,080

the most critical one

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
Brother Shenshu,

342
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,960
I want to ask you a question.

343
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,240
Go on.

344
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,680
You said it was going to rain, and mother was going to get married.

345
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,280
Who is this mother talking about?

346
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,560
I thought

347
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
the mother who wants to marry

348
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
is by no means a child's mother.

349
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,760
It should be an unmarried girl.

350
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,160
Recently, I read Wang Youguang's

351
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,160
"Wuxia Yanlian"

352
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
regarding the proverb "It rains when Heaven deems fit, mother remarries when she wants to".

353
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,680
This is how he explained it.

354
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,120
He said heaven,

355
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
pure yang without yin,

356
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,600
wishes for rain, thus yang seeks yin.

357
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,480
And the mother?

358
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,800
A solitary yin (=female) without yang (=male),

359
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
She wishes to remarry, thus yin seeks yang.

360
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,640
Like an arrow landing on its target, like a pulp making tofu.

361
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,000
Thus is its reason, thus is the trend.

362
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,320
Look at this Wang Youguang.

363
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
He said this married mother

364
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,200
is an unmarried woman.

365
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,480
If she's a married woman,

366
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
it is impossible to be a solitary yin without yang.

367
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,520
Thus the so-called "a man at the coming of age should marry, and so should a girl".

368
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,920
If a girl gets older

369
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,400
and stays, she will become an enemy.

370
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,440
A mother wishing to be re-married is the way of humanity.

371
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,280
Heaven wishing for rain

372
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,040
is the way of heaven.

373
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
The way of heaven and the way of humanity are both irresistible.

374
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,320
Gu Tangsheng, you are telling us all of this.

375
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
What does this mean?

376
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,840
I just want to tell you.

377
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
If it is to go, it must go.

378
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,360
If it is to stay, it must stay.

379
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,480
This is not subject to the will of men.

380
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,280
Come and see!

381
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,720
Why did Mr. Cai run away?

382
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,160
He didn't put oil on his feet, did he?

383
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,040
He slipped away first.

384
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,440
Mister is here.

385
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,760
Hello, sir.

386
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:58,807
[Gu Hongming, born Tangsheng, Professor at Peking University]

387
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,720
"How I tire!

388
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,388
[Huang Kan, styled Jigang, Professor at Peking University]

389
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
The one who kills your horse is on the side of the road.

390
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,160
The people have been working hard enough, they can take a short break.

391
00:23:01,836 --> 00:23:03,927
[Liu Shipei, styled Shenshu, Professor at Peking University]

392
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
I would like a short break."

393
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,840
The president of Peking University has formally resigned

394
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
from all other schools and assemblies with which he is associated,

395
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,360
and from May 9th onwards

396
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
all relations

397
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,160
are severed.

398
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
Only those who know me will understand.

399
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,480
Sir, Mr. Cai left this note.

400
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,840
What exactly does it mean?

401
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,360
Now there are all kinds of explanations.

402
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
You are the authority.

403
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
Tell us all about it.

404
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,560
Yes, sir. Tell us about it.

405
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,080
Are you a liberal arts student?

406
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:34,880
Yes.

407
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,560
Can't you understand this?

408
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,000
We understand the words,

409
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,200
but what about the truth?

410
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,040
Students.

411
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,320
Students.

412
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,960
Listen to me.

413
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,560
Look.

414
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,880
Mr. Cai.

415
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,160
This note begins

416
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,080
with two allusions.

417
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,520
If we want to understand Mr. Cai's mind,

418
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
we must first know these two allusions.

419
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,520
Look at this allusion.

420
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
The one who kills your horse is on the side of the road.

421
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,160
It comes from the book written by Ying Shao in the Han Dynasty,

422
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,520
"The General Theory of Customs and Traditions".

423
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,880
Its original text is

424
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
"An officer's horse is fat,

425
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
the watchers cheer the quick horse,

426
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,960
he takes advantage of their words

427
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
and gallops endlessly,

428
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,800
thus a barren death."

429
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,920
Mr. Gu,

430
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,440
I don't get it.

431
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
Can you tell us using the vernacular?

432
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,960
Yes, sir.

433
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,320
Can you tell us using the vernacular?

434
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,160
Look at you, a liberal arts student

435
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
learning without being proficient.

436
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
The meaning of this allusion is

437
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,080
there is an officer,

438
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,400
his horse is fattened and runs fast,

439
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,560
he is praised by passers-by.

440
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,680
What about this rider?

441
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
He begins to gloat.

442
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
He is riding his horse and whipping his whip.

443
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,880
As a result, this horse was exhausted.

444
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,320
So Mr. Cai quoted this allusion.

445
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,920
What exactly does it mean?

446
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,960
Don't worry.

447
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,760
There is a second story.

448
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,840
"The people have been working hard enough

449
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,360
They can take a short break."

450
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,440
It comes from "Shijing - Daya"'s

451
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,160
"People's Labor".

452
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,320
Its second sentence begins with

453
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,320
"The people have been working hard enough,

454
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,840
they can take a short break.

455
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,840
To benefit China,

456
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,440
for the people."

457
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,200
Master Tang.

458
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,120
What you're talking about

459
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,320
is off-topic.

460
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,680
Students mean to ask you,

461
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,280
what does this note mean?

462
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,280
Student.

463
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,880
Let me tell you.

464
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
The roadside that is the horse's killer,

465
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,760
this gentleman refers to the government.

466
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,520
This horse

467
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,120
refers to Cao Rulin and Zhang Zongxiang.

468
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,960
This roadside

469
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,880
refers to you students.

470
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
Cai Yuanpei means

471
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
you students are in trouble.

472
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,920
He had to run away.

473
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,200
It can't be true!

474
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,280
No!

475
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,920
You are slandering Master Cai!

476
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,240
Students.

477
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,920
I thought this gentleman refers to you students.

478
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,560
The horse also refers to Master Cai himself.

479
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,000
As for the roadside,

480
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,360
that's the damn Paris Peace Treaty

481
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,000
and the traitors Cao, Zhang, and Lu.

482
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,880
The reason why Master Cai ran away

483
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,040
was because he was victimized by a traitor.

484
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,240
He did this

485
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
may be out of necessity.

486
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,640
It may also be a delaying tactic.

487
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
But I, Gu Hongming, believe

488
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
Master Cai will never abandon Peking University.

489
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,960
Good point!

490
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,080
It rains when Heaven deems fit, mother remarries when she wants to.

491
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,120
Just let it be.

492
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,600
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

493
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,080
Cai Yuanpei left school

494
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,960
and left a mysterious note.

495
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,080
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

496
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,800
Sir, buy a newspaper.

497
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
Cai Yuanpei left school.

498
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
and left a mysterious note.

499
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,960
Selling newspapers! Selling newspapers!

500
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
Master Cai was forced away by the government.

501
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,360
To save the students,

502
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,280
he had to resign.

503
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,480
He left, so the contradictions can be transferred to him

504
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
and the students can be rescued.

505
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,680
That's right.

506
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,480
The reasons why Mr. Cai left without saying goodbye, was

507
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,320
one, to protect students;

508
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,640
two, so that we do not compromise

509
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,520
and keep fighting;

510
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,880
three, an army can take away a division,

511
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,880
ut a man cannot take away his will.

512
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,480
Mr. Cai is not here,

513
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
just in time for all of us

514
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,080
to put into practice or action.

515
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,160
I think our immediate priority

516
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,760
is to carry out the campaign to protect Cai.

517
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,040
Not just in Peking University,

518
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,640
but in the whole of Beijing,

519
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,400
even the whole of China.

520
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,360
Use Mr. Cai to restrain the government

521
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,040
so that the government can't take care of the students.

522
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,080
Let's discuss how to do it specifically.

523
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,800
Yes, or please ask the Federation of Students to organize.

524
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,640
It's not enough for the Federation of Students to come forward.

525
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,400
The direct target of the Cai movement is the government.

526
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
Then the professors should take the lead.

527
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I think we should get in touch right now

528
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,480
with Chen Baoquan of Beijing Normal University.

529
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,920
He took the lead

530
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,200
in organizing and setting up

531
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,880
Beijing Federation of School Staff

532
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,400
to negotiate with the government.

533
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,000
At this time,

534
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
he was ready to combine protests, lectures and speeches,

535
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,640
and go deep into all levels of society

536
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
to make the whole of China move.

537
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,800
If we can't do it, let's have a general strike.

538
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,240
I propose

539
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,320
having Peking University professors jointly Write a statement

540
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,200
to the Ministry of Education.

541
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
Show that Peking University teachers and students

542
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,400
vow to advance and retreat with President Cai,

543
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,880
ask the Ministry of Education to retain Cai Yuanpei.

544
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,800
If Cai Yuanpei does not stay,

545
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,360
then all the professors of Peking University unanimously resign.

546
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,440
If you have no objection,

547
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,000
I volunteer to draft this statement.

548
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,640
Good.

549
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Then I'll get someone to sign it.

550
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,040
When I came here just now,

551
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,400
I also met Gu Hongming and Liu Shipei.

552
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
They all specifically mentioned it to me.

553
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
If there is any action,

554
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,720
be sure to inform them.

555
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,600
We will certainly win the overwhelming support.

556
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,160
Then everyone should do their job.

557
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,040
Let's act now.

558
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,000
Minister, the president's office just called,

559
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,880
saying Chen Baoquan, Tange Er, and eighteen other

560
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,760
principals of colleges and universities in Beijing have collectively writen a letter

561
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
to suspend the Qing government to retain Cai Yuanpei.

562
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
We are ordered to pay close attention

563
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
to the situation of professors in universities.

564
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,240
A petition of all professors of Peking University.

565
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,360
You will forward this to Premier Qian immediately.

566
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
Those official documents on the desk,

567
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,240
please also handle them together.

568
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,240
I have to go now.

569
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,200
Minister. The-

570
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
This seat is not for men to sit on.

571
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm going to follow Cai Yuanpei's example and walk away.

572
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,840
Don't look for me.

573
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
You won't be able to find me either.

574
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,720
Chief, you're leaving?

575
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,400
What can we do about this mess?

576
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
It rains when Heaven deems fit, mother remarries when she wants to.

577
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,920
Just let it be.

578
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,680
Minister.

579
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,640
Minister.

580
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,360
I got you two here today

581
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,960
just to discuss

582
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,840
the problems of the Ministry of Education and Peking University.

583
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
Half a month has passed,

584
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,160
the student unrest is a wave of unrest.

585
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,448
[Li Changtai, Nine Gates Infantry Commander]

586
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,040
This makes me dizzy.

587
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,760
Sit.

588
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,280
Cai Yuanpei ran away,

589
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,160
making all the principals in Beijing resign.

590
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,728
[Qian Nengxun, styled Xicheng, Premier of the Beiyang Government]

591
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,440
It's a last resort.

592
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,800
I just issued a retention order.

593
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
I didn't expect this Fu Zengxiang

594
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:18,751
[Xu Shichang, pen name Juren, President of the Republic of China]

595
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
to also leave without saying goodbye.

596
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,440
He has disappeared for several days.

597
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,200
Now students are noisy in the street every day.

598
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,880
I have heard,

599
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,480
some people are dead.

600
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,400
Premier Qian, tell me about the situation.

601
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,520
A graduate of Tsinghua, the day before yesterday,

602
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,320
was overworked and killed during the speech.

603
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,120
A graduate of the former Jingshi University, yesterday,

604
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,200
threw himself in Taiping Lake

605
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,240
and left a highly provocative suicide note.

606
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,800
Police Chief Wu is worried that students will use this suicide note.

607
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
In the past two days, police forces have been deployed around the school

608
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,880
fearing an accident.

609
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,360
This student thing can't be solved.

610
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,160
You have no good days anywhere.

611
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,800
Guys, tell me what to do.

612
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,880
You want me to say it?

613
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,040
The root is that we are too soft.

614
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,840
Fu Zengxiang,

615
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,480
he said that only appeasement can prevent an accident.

616
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,640
Now it's appeasing trouble.

617
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,520
He ran away by himself.

618
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,160
This kind of person can't accomplish anything.

619
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,480
And Wu Bingxiang, an idiot,

620
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,480
has released all the students we have caught.

621
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,840
Now we're stupid.

622
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,440
These people who know how to read and write

623
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,280
are the ones who look at people's faces.

624
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,960
If you are soft, they will be hard.

625
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,800
If they are soft, you will be hard.

626
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,600
Premier Qian, what do you think?

627
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,520
I think the root of this matter is still in Paris.

628
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,760
The matter of the peace treaty is not resolved.

629
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,920
The students' affairs can't be solved.

630
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
One at a time.

631
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,720
What if we solve the students' problems first?

632
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,080
I have no choice.

633
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,480
I listen to the President.

634
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,000
Please, Mr. President. Instruct us.

635
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,200
Well, let me tell you something.

636
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,760
I discussed it with Duan recently.

637
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,840
The two of us have drawn up several articles.

638
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,560
First,

639
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,840
Fu Zengxiang, Minister of Education, was relieved of his post as Minister.

640
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,520
Tian Yinghuang will replace him.

641
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,240
Second, reject Cao Rulin's Zhang Zongxiang's

642
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,400
Lu Zongyu's resignation request

643
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,840
and continue to appoint them.

644
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,480
Third, in light of Cai Yuanpei's resignation,

645
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,440
Hu Renyuan will in charge of Peking University temporarily.

646
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,560
Fourth, instruct the Nine Gates Infantry Commander

647
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,840
and the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department

648
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,840
to seriously protect the security of Beijing.

649
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,520
Those who refuse to accept the pressure in case of correcting troubles

650
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,960
shall be arrested and punished according to law.

651
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,600
Fifth,

652
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,120
trial the students who caused trouble on May 4th according to law.

653
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,720
Wise choice, Mr. President.

654
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,640
Gentlemen, Master Ge, here they come.

655
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,280
Mr. Chen.

656
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,520
Sir.

657
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
We represent thousands of workers in Changxindian

658
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,000
to mourn the martyrs who died for their country.

659
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,680
When I came,

660
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,440
the workmates asked me to give you a message.

661
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,480
We must not let the current asshole government

662
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
to lose Qingdao.

663
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,000
If Xu Shichang dares to betray his country,

664
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,840
our workers resolutely refuse to agree.

665
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,520
Thank you.

666
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,040
Sir, this is the decision just made by the Federation of Students.

667
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,320
Please sit down for a while.

668
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,880
Be busy first.

669
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,560
Who of you have been to Qingdao?

670
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,680
Is Qingdao beautiful?

671
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,560
I've never been there once.

672
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
Xingang promised me that,

673
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,960
after graduation,

674
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,720
he would take me to his hometown in Qingdao

675
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,840
and marry me.

676
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,440
He also told me,

677
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,120
there was a pier in Qingdao.

678
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,560
It's just a long, long bridge.

679
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
It's over a hundred meters.

680
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,280
All the way to the sea.

681
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,320
He said to go to the end of the bridge.

682
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,240
You can see a white lighthouse.

683
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,360
Especially nice.

684
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,600
Xingang also laughed at me and said,

685
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
I am a girl.

686
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,160
I dare not walk on the trestle by myself.

687
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,960
Because sometimes the wind is very strong and the waves are very big.

688
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,360
A wave can come and take me into the sea.

689
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,280
Xingang said,

690
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,360
if I fell into the water,

691
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,360
he certainly won't save me.

692
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,680
He will stay on the trestle and laugh

693
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,840
as I choke on water.

694
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,560
He let me learn to swim by myself already

695
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
Mother, why do you think he is so bad?

696
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,920
It's okay.

697
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,240
Good child.

698
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,520
Don't cry.

699
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,840
Don't cry.

700
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,680
It's okay. It's okay.

701
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,680
Good child.

702
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,880
Don't cry.

703
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,320
Good child.

704
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,160
Bai Lan, you can

705
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,080
live with Liu Mei

706
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
when you go to France for work-study together.

707
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,680
When you go,

708
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,160
you will be willing to red Qingdao with blood.

709
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,240
Here.

710
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,840
When I come,

711
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,840
I will not allow any raging slave to shake Mount Tai.

712
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,920
Hang it up.

713
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,560
Saving the nation and learning honestly.

714
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,920
Which is mature? Which is young? Which is big? Which is small?

715
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,560
It is self-evident.

716
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,120
The fate of the individual and the country are inseparable.

717
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,640
Now I understand this movement.

718
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
In addition to letting the people act directly,

719
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
beyond directly solving the problem,

720
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,680
we still must add one more word:

721
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,091
Sacrifice.

722
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:29,162
Sacrifice.

723
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,880
Without sacrifice, it's impossible to win.

724
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,160
Dear teachers. Dear students.

725
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,120
Guo Xingang loved this country.

726
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
He gave his precious life.

727
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
He is our Peking University,

728
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,520
Beijing academic circles,

729
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,480
even the glory and pride of the whole of China.

730
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,840
We will never forget him.

731
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,040
We're going to use Guo Xingang's death

732
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,960
to awaken the people,

733
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,640
inherit its ambition

734
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,200
and complete his unfinished work.

735
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,880
So we decided,

736
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,080
here on the afternoon of May 18th,

737
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,800
to hold a memorial for the martyr Guo Xingang.

738
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,480
At the same time, I announce

739
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,840
the resolution of the meeting

740
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,440
of Beijing post-secondary schools,

741
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,480
the Beijing Federation of Students,

742
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,160
and Beijing Federation of School Staff.

743
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,120
In order to resist the perverse actions of Beiyang government,

744
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,720
it is decided that from May 19th

745
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,280
all schools in Beijing

746
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,640
hold a general strike.

747
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:58,511
[Return me to Qingdao]

748
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,680
This is left by Xingang's blood.

749
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,440
Let's observe silence for Xingang.

750
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,960
The strike should be combined with protest preaching

751
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,920
to mobilize the masses.

752
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,800
The civilian education lecture group

753
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,840
is to play a greater role.

754
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,960
You have to make a plan.

755
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,960
Not only should we go deep into all classes in Beijing,

756
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,760
we must go even deeper

757
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,520
into Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinann and Changsha,

758
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,640
these big cities.

759
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
Win the support of the whole country.

760
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,360
In these big cities,

761
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,040
also hold Guo Xingang's memorial service.

762
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,720
This is the best way to mobilize the masses.

763
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,480
I'm going to Changsha in a few days.

764
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,920
I heard Mao Zedong and the others

765
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,120
are doing well there.

766
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm going to learn from them

767
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,920
and make a horizontal alliance.

768
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,040
Especially Shanghai.

769
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,400
That is the gathering place of the working class.

770
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,560
Let Shanghai become the second center

771
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,440
of the student movement.

772
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,720
It should play an even greater role.

773
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
I went to Shanghai to preach Guo Xingang.

774
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,280
Good.

775
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,960
Then we'll prepare more publicity groups for the south.

776
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:11,920
Good.

777
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,840
Yannian. Qiaonian.

778
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,200
I have a job for you.

779
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,960
I just wrote an article.

780
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,440
The title is

781
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,120
"Inform all sides about the Shandong issue"

782
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,040
This article is written for the general strike tomorrow.

783
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,480
I mainly want to tell you honestly,

784
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,640
I don't think that the Shandong problem

785
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,480
is just a matter of the survival of a province,

786
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,800
nor a matter of academic circles,

787
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,240
but the whole of China.
