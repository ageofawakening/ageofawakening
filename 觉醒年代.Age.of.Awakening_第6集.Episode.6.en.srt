Come in, come in, come in.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
Brother Zhongfu, you are welcome to visit!

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:14,960
Come in!

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,280
This is Mr. Xingyan's great work!

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,520
The plan is to publish it after the New Year,

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,800
edited by Mr. Zhang Shizhao.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,760
Shouchang co-organised,

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,800
I just am a part-time editor.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,000
Preparations are now underway.

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:32,960
Good.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,800
Brother Mengzou, you see?

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
That's what an editorial board looks like.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,760

One person in the house.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,400
Not uncomfortable.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Now that we have the money,

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,840
can we move the Yadong Library

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,360
to the main road?

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,800
This... mountain, high or low;

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,240
any mountain, high or low, can be given spirit by god.

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
If you write an article that doesn't make an impact,

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
it's no use moving to the Bund.

Stingy.

00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,360
Is Brother Zhongfu here?

Brother Zhongfu.

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,720
Long time no see.

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
I didn't expect you to be so late!

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,320
How to afford

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,480
this enlightening master's title?

38
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,320
What do you mean by that?

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,040
This dress is mine, right?

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,000
I think it is.

41
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,680
I've been wearing it for a long time.

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
It has been worn for some time.

43
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,080
It's time to give it back to me.

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,800
Impossible.

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,520
This dress

46
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,920
is imbued with Shouchang's deep love and affection.

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
Warmer than wearing any other clothes,

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,120
how can I return it to you?

49
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,160
I can't let it go.

50
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,520
Brother Zhongfu.

51
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,280
Although it is said that the wind in the south,

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
may not be greater than the wind in the north.

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,560
But the winter in the south

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,840
must be colder than in the north.

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
This dress is for you.

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,560
Shouchang!

57
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,560
You can't touch me twice with one piece of clothing.

58
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
Amazing, Shouchang.

59
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,480
In the blink of an eye, you've become a journalist in the capital.

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
Well, if we are

61
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,040
not "The Tiger" nor "New Youth",

62
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,920
we will have a lot of problems to discuss together.

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Brother Zhongfu mentioned this "New Youth".

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
I really want to have a good discussion with you.

65
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,440
Great!

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
Coincidentally, many workers and friends came with me to Changxindian

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,680
who are raising rabbits at home.

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
So, let's talk over dinner and drink.

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,600
You also know many coworkers and friends.

Mr. Chen, we cooked wild rabbit meat stew

99

and made dumplings.

115

I was often told about you.

What did they about me?

117
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
They said that you and he

122

Then why did they beat you?

Don't you know?

127
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,600
Don't they still think that you are too extreme

128

Mr. Xingyan has said

143
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,200
that our "The Tiger"

is crawling behind the buttocks

Any student who cares about politics

176

basically must read every issue.

177
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,640

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,080
Is it?

187
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
Mr. Chen.

188
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
We workers also know "New Youth".

189
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,920
Those who read and write characters on our railway

190
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
discuss "New Youth" when they are free.

191
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,920
I have my ears everywhere

192
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,720
so I know.

193
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,520
Master Ge.

194
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,400
Do you know Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science?

195
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science.

196
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,520
Heard of them, don't know much about them.

197
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,080
But Mr. Chen,

198
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,880
the vernacular writing movement you advocated,

199
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,640
we workers especially welcome it.

200
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,200
It's easier to understand than that classical Chinese.

201
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,320
It's close to us.

202
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
Master Ge.

203
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,840
Do you workers care

204
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
about the affairs of the country too?

205
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,080
Of course I care.

206
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Can you not care about your first family?

207
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,840
But Mr. Chen,

208
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,000
we workers have no culture

209
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,360
or strength,

210
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
so if we do not have them,

211
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
we need people like you

212
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,360
to show us the way.

213
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,240
We will follow you to the edge of the fire and through the knife!

214
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,760
Brother Zhongfu, how about this area of Beijing?

215
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,200
An area of many hidden talents.
(lit. crouching tiger, hidden dragon)

216
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,600
The purpose of "New Youth" is to create a new generation.

217
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,840
But what is the new people?

218
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I thought new people were

219
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,360
new students, new workers, new farmers

220
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,520
and even new officials.

221
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,080
Only by having all classes transformed,

222
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
can the whole society qualitatively change.

223
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,920
Where is Beijing? Above is the sky, below is the earth.

224
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,360
It is definitely the best place for "New Youth".

225
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
In addition, the magazine placed in Beijing

226
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,688
[Gao Yihan, editor of "The Tiger Daily"]

227
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,400
can also strengthen its editorial power.

228
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
Now the larger and more influential magazines

229
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,320
are taking the same editorial system.

230
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
If "New Youth" is still

231
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
just you and Yi Baisha,

232
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
I'm afraid that's not enough

233
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,720
to meet the needs of the majority of readers.

234
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,760
You see?

235
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,280
Shouchang. Master Ge.

236
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,080
You guys really taught me a lesson today.

237
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
But... Shouchang.

238
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
I really want to bring "New Youth"

239
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,880
to Beijing.

240
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
I have two conditions, Shouchang.

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,640
Say it.

242
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
First, you have to come and help me.

243
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
We'll do it together.

244
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,640
I must do my part.

245
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160
I can still let you eat. (?)

246
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,880
Second, I have to ask my boss

247
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
who is in charge of money, Wang Mengou, Manager Wang,

248
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
listen to his opinion

249
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,040
and see his attitude.

250
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
This Cai Yuanpei came to see you twice.

251
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
I already knew that

252
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120
you were said to be tempted, you.

253
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I thought about it all night last night.

254
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,880
Editors print in Beijing and Shanghai.

255
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
This will open up the country's roads

256
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,120
and lead it by going to the next level.

257
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,920
Right.

258
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880
Good!

259
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,800
Shouchang, then I will put the battleground in Beijing.

260
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,327
That's excellent!

261
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:31,691
Excellent!

262
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,480
Gentlemen, this stewed wild rabbit meat is ready.

263
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,360
Let's eat!

264
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
I... I don't eat rabbit.

265
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,040
Why?

266
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120
I was born in a Year of the Rabbit, and it happens to be an Earth Rabbit.
(lit. I am a rabbit, and I happen to be a wild rabbit.)

267
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,520
Then what are you going to eat?

268
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
There are dumplings here!

269
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,600
Right, right.

270
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,640
Mr. Chen, these dumplings are also stuffed with rabbit.

271
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,320


272
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800


273
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800


274
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,200


275
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,200


276
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,320


277
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,480


278
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,360


279
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200


280
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880


281
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,280


282
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000


283
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560


284
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,720


285
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,920


286
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,280


287
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,320


288
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,360


289
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,440


290
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,640


291
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,280


292
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,800


293
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,680


294
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040


295
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,320


296
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360


297
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,360


298
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120


299
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040


300
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,520


301
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,000


302
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,040


303
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,000


304
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,880


305
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,560


306
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,280


307
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360


308
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,440


309
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,400


310
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480


311
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,280


312
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760


313
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,200


314
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800


315
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,080


316
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,320


317
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480


318
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960


319
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,520


320
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320


321
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,320


322
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560


323
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560


324
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640


325
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,280


326
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760


327
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,920
