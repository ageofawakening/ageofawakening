Come in, come in, come in.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
Brother Zhongfu, you are welcome to visit!

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:14,960
Come in!

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,280
This is Mr. Xingyan's great work!

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,520
The plan is to publish it after the New Year,

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,800
edited by Mr. Zhang Shizhao.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,760
Shouchang co-organised.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm just a part-time editor.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,000
Preparations are now underway.

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:32,960
Good.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,800
Brother Mengzou, you see?

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
That's what an editorial board looks like.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,760

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,400
Is it uncomfortable or not?

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Now that we have the money,

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,840
can we move the Yadong Library

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,360
to the main road?

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,800
This... mountain, high or low...

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,240
any mountain, high or low, can have a heavenly aura.

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
If you write an article that doesn't make an impact,

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
it's no point moving to the Bund.

Is Brother Zhongfu here?

Brother Zhongfu.

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,720
Long time no see.

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
I didn't expect you to be so late!

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,320
How to afford

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,480
this enlightening master's title?

38
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,320
What do you mean by that?

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,040
This dress is mine, right?

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,000
I think it is.

41
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,680
I've been wearing it for a long time.

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
It has been worn for some time.

43
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,080
It's time to give it back to me.

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,800
Impossible.

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,520
This dress

46
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,920
is imbued with Shouchang's deep love and affection.

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
Warmer than wearing any other clothes,

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,120
how can I return it to you?

49
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,160
I can't let it go.

50
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,520
Brother Zhongfu.

51
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,280
Although it is said that the wind in the south,

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
may not be greater than the wind in the north.

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,560
But the winter in the south

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,840
must be colder than in the north.

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
This dress is for you.

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,560
Shouchang!

57
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,560
You can't touch me twice with one dress.

58
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
Amazing, Shouchang.

59
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,480
In the blink of an eye, you've become a journalist in the capital.

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
Well, if we are

61
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,040
not "The Tiger" nor "New Youth",

62
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,920
we will have a lot of problems to discuss together.

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Brother Zhongfu mentioned this "New Youth".

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
I really want to have a good discussion with you.

65
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,440
Great!

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
Coincidentally, I came to Changxindian with many workers and friends

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,680
who are cooking rabbits at home.

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
So, let's talk over dinner and drink.

71
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,600
You also know many coworkers and friends.

Dear friend, how intimate.

73

Mr. Chen, we cooked wild rabbit meat stew

99

and made dumplings.

I also wrapped dumplings myself.

112

I also personally go to the toilet.

115
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,760
I was often told about you.

116

What did they about me?

117
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
They said that you and he

are friends from the quarrel in Japan.

119

122

I can attest to that.

125

Then why did they beat you?

Don't you know?

127
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,600
Don't they still think that you are too extreme

128

that our "The Tiger"

is crawling behind "New Youth"

Any student who cares about politics

176

basically must read every issue.

177
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,640
It's just that it's hard for students in Beijing

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,080
Is it?

187
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
Mr. Chen.

188
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
We workers also know "New Youth".

189
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,920
Those who read and write characters on our railway

190
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
discuss "New Youth" when they are free.

191
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,920
I have my ears everywhere

192
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,720
so I know.

193
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,520
Master Ge.

194
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,400
Do you know Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science?

195
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science.

196
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,520
Heard of them, don't know much about them.

197
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,080
But Mr. Chen,

198
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,880
the vernacular writing movement you advocated,

199
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,640
we workers especially welcome it.

200
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,200
It's easier to understand than that classical Chinese.

201
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,320
It's close to us.

202
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
Master Ge.

203
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,840
Do you workers care

204
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
about the affairs of the country too?

205
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,080
Of course I care.

206
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Can you not care about your first family?

207
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,840
But Mr. Chen,

208
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,000
we workers have no culture

209
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,360
or strength,

210
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
so if we do not have them,

211
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
we need people like you

212
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,360
to show us the way.

213
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,240
We will follow you to the edge of the fire and through the knife!

214
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,760
Brother Zhongfu, how about this area of Beijing?

215
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,200
An area of many hidden talents.
(lit. crouching tiger, hidden dragon)

216
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,600
The purpose of "New Youth" is to create a new generation.

217
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,840
But what is the new people?

218
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I thought new people were

219
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,360
new students, new workers, new farmers

220
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,520
and even new officials.

221
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,080
Only by having all classes transformed,

222
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
can the whole society qualitatively change.

223
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,920
Where is Beijing? Above is the sky, below is the earth.

224
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,360
It is definitely the best place for "New Youth".

225
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
In addition, the magazine placed in Beijing

00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,688
[Gao Yihan, editor of "The Tiger Daily"]

227
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,400
can also strengthen its editorial power.

228
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
Now the larger and more influential magazines

229
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,320
are taking the same editorial system.

230
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
If "New Youth" is still

231
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
just you and Yi Baisha,

232
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440

238
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
I really want to bring "New Youth"

239
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,880
to Beijing.

240
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,640

242
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
First, you have to come and help me.

243
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
We'll do it together.

244
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,640
I must do my part.

245
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll still leave you some work to eat.

246
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,880
Second, I have to ask my boss

247
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
who is in charge of money, Wang Mengou, Manager Wang,

248
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
listen to his opinion

249
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,040
and see his attitude.

250

251

256

and lead it by going to the next level.

257
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,920

261
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:31,691
Excellent!

264

I... I don't eat rabbit.

265
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,040
Why?

266
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120

(lit. I am a rabbit, and I happen to be a wild rabbit.)

267
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,520

268
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480

269
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,600

If I don't do it,

280
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880
it's unappreciative.

281
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,280
It's just that I've never taught at a university before.

282
