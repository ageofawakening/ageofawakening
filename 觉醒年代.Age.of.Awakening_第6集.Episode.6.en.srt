00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160


238
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,880


239
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520


240
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360


241
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,040


242
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000


243
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680


244
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120


245
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920


246
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,880


247
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440


248
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,120


249
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,920


250
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880


251
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,800


252
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,600


253
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,480


254
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,360


255
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120


256
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,040


257
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120


258
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,520


259
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480


260
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,600


261
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,640


262
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,320


263
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800


264
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800


265
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,200


266
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,200


267
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,320


268
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,480


269
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,360


270
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200


271
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880


272
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,280


273
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000


274
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560


275
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,720


276
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,920


277
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,280


278
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,320


279
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,360


280
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,440


281
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,640


282
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,280


283
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,800


284
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,680


285
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040


286
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,320


287
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360


288
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,360


289
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120


290
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040


291
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,520


292
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,000


293
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,040


294
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,000


295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,880


296
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,560


297
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,280


298
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360


299
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,440


300
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,400


301
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480


302
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,280


303
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760


304
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,200


305
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800


306
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,080


307
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,320


308
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480


309
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960


310
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,520


311
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320


312
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,320


313
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560


314
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560


315
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640


316
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,280


317
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760


318
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000


319
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,920


320
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,760


321
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,680


322
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,840


323
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040


324
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,160


325
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720


326
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,600


327
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,640


328
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,280


329
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,880


330
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,640


331
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,640


332
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,720


333
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,360


334
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,080


335
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480


336
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,240


337
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880


338
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,040


339
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360


340
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,720


341
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,240


342
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
Neither has he gone to a proper university

343
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,640
nor does he have any teaching qualifications.

344
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,000
How can he have a monthly salary

345
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
that is 20 dollars more than yours?

346
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,080
You, a master versed in both Chinese and Western learning.

347
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,040
The tide.

348
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,840
The tide of the world is mighty.

349
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,360
Those who submit will prosper; those who resist shall perish.

350
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
Brother Jigang, I predict your style of

351
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,880
quoting scriptures, mimicking ancients and

352
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,640
obscurant nonsense will not survive

353
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,200
much longer at Peking University after today.

354
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,720
When did brother Deqian hop on the bandwagon 

355
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
and become a cheerleader for literary reform?

356
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
Not only reform, but thoroughly repudiate those mistaken ways 
and turn over a new leaf.

357
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,800
Without eradicating the parallel prose of the Six Dynasties,

358
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,080
without abolishing the demons of the Wenxuan school 
and the bastards of the Tongcheng school

359
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
Chinese literature has no future.

360
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
Aye! Aye!

361
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
Well said!

362
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
Yes!

363
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
Write that down as well.

364
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,440
Exactly!

365
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,400
Mister Qian,

366
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,720
You're even fresher than Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi!

367
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,920
But you know what they say about fresh fish?

368
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,080
He is very fresh indeed!
[insinuation: new, but spoils quickly]

369
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Associate Professor, what is that supposed to mean?

370
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,280
What is that? Ridiculous...

371
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,800
Mister Cai.

372
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,760
Everything is ready.

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,440
Just waiting for your inaugural speech.

374
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
President Cai is here.

375
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,480
Please be seated.

376
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
Gentlemen, students.

377
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,720
On December 26th, in the fifth year of the Republic [1916]

378
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,160
On the order of the President of the Republic of China,

379
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,680
Cai Yuanpei is appointed as the President of Peking University.

380
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,520
As decreed.

381
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,560
Hurrah, hurrah.

382
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
Hurrah.

383
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,520
And now we invite President Cai

384
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
to deliver his inaugural speech.

385
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,800
Hurrah.

386
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,400
Honoured guests,

387
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,360
Five years ago, when Yan Fu was the president of Peking University,

388
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
I served in the Ministry of Education,

389
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,920
as the Minister of Education.

390
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
I remember making a small dedication to this school

391
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
on the first day of the new term that year.

392
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,400
Gentlemen, many of you have come here from preparatory school.

393
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,240
So you presumably know that 

394
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
after even three days of absence, a scholar must be regarded with new eyes.

395
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,000
Let alone it's now been several years.

396
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,560
The gentlemen present, when compared to the past,

397
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
must have made remarkable progress.

398
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Today, I am here to serve Peking University.

399
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,080
I have three things I would like to share with everyone.

400
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,960
One, hold fast to your purpose.

401
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,560
Coming here to study, you must have a certain purpose.

402
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,160
In order to know whether that purpose is upright or not,

403
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,200
you must first be clear about the university's purpose.

404
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,000
A university is a place for research and deep knowledge.

405
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,120
Now there are people outside Peking University who denounce it

406
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,560
as a corrupt institution.

407
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
This is because of those who come here to study

408
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
as a shortcut for their ambitions of 

409
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,080
of officialdom and wealth.

410
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,000
In their single-minded wish to become officials, to get rich

411
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,440
they care nothing for their professors' depth of learning.

412
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,600
And think only of their bureaucratic rankings.

413
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
The higher the rank, the more popular they are.

414
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,040
Their is probably for the favour

415
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,680
of receiving their guidance after graduating.

416
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,040
What I want to say is,

417
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
you are coming to study at Peking University

418
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,600
for three or four years.

419
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,840
This cannot be regarded as a long time.

420
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
But if you cherish your time and study diligently,

421
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,520
then you can certainly attain a high level of mastery.

422
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,240
If your purpose of coming to Peking University

423
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,080
is to become an official or make a fortune,

424
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,640
then your purpose is mistaken.

425
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,800
And you are bound to go astray in your studies.

426
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,080
Going to brothels regularly and only revising

427
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,720
when there is a test.

428
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,680
Ignoring the surpluses and shortfalls of your learning.

429
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
Striving only for marks.

430
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,600
Once the exam is done,

431
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,080
the books are shelved and neglected.

432
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,240
Hardly ever taking an initiative, only carelessly doing the bare minimum.

433
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
With the diploma in hand,

434
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,520
so you participate in society in this manner.

435
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,600
Frittering away your time, having learned absolutely nothing.

436
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,680
This is self-defeating.

437
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
This is completely contrary

438
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
to the true purpose of studying at Peking University.

439
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Perhaps everyone still remembers

440
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
the Xinhai Revolution, which happened not long ago.

441
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,120
The reason we wanted a revolution

442
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,920
was because the Qing government was too corrupt.

443
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,400
That there are also many people now

444
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,160
dissatisfied with the status quo

445
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,920
is also because of the moral bankruptcy of society.

446
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,240
Gentlemen, if at this time you do not

447
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,000
build a strong foundation and diligently study,

448
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,920
and by chance you are forced to make a living and become a teacher

449
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,280
you will certainly hinder your students.

450
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,280
If you enter politics,

451
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,080
you will certainly hinder the nation.

452
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
This is the hindrance of others.

453
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Harming others and harming yourself.

454
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,680
Therefore your purpose must be righteous.

455
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,240
This is the first of my hopes for you gentlemen.

456
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,280
Good.

457
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,880
That's the Cai Yuanpei I know.

458
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,660
Finding the root of Peking University's ills as soon as he takes office.

459
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,394
Two, encourage moral integrity.

460
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,560
The general tendency of society today

461
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,600
is increasingly one of resignation and apathy.

462
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,320
Soley preoccupied with the present, morally bankrupt.

463
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,240
Moral corruption everywhere you look.

464
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,440
Those without a firm virtuous foundation

465
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,480
are rarely not contaminated by this social ethos.

466
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,920
The nation's rise and fall

467
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,640
depends on the strength or weakness of its customs.

468
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,760
If everyone follows customs of those of the present,

469
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,840
it is impossible to imagine a future.

470
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,920
Therefore, there must be unsurpassed scholars, who by the example

471
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,480
of their own conduct, forcefully overcome these degenerate customs.

472
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,040
Gentlemen, as university students,

473
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,040
you are in a position of high standing,

474
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,240
duty-bound to shoulder these heavy responsibilities.

475
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,080
Virtue without cultivation, learning without conduct,

476
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
wallowing in the mire

477
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,800
of these degenerate social norms.

478
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,200
Not only does this disgraceful oneself.

479
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,120
Moreover, an example is set for others.

480
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,480
Therefore,

481
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,520
moral conduct cannot be otherwise, 
but a matter treated with rigorous practice. 

482
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
This is the second of my hopes for you gentlemen.

483
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,520
Three, respect for teachers and friends.

484
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,640
Be completely candid, speak frankly and openly, encourage one another.

485
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,560
Everyone, we are all at Peking University,

486
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,600
we will together both share the glory and bear the shame. 

487
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,520
I believe our Peking University is certain to be the home

488
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,920
of cultural experts and leading thinkers.

489
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,520
This concludes my speech.

490
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,680
We will have ample opportunity to continue our discussions.

491
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,640


492
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,840


493
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,520


494
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,840


495
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,600


496
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,800


497
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,720


498
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,520


499
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,320


500
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:54,960


501
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,480


502
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,600


503
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760


504
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,680


505
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,400


506
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,400


507
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320


508
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,320


509
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240


510
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,560


511
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,160


512
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,080


513
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,080


514
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,280


515
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,800


516
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,880


517
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,880


518
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,560


519
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,000


520
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,600


521
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,120


522
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,640


523
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,920


524
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,280

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,360


526
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,400

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,920


528
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,040


529
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,720


530
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,400


531
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,080


532
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880


533
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,560


534
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,080

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,400

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,840

00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,840


543
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,200


544
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,480

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
