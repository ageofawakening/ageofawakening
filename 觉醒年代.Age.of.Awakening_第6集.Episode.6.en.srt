Brother Zhongfu, you are welcome to visit!

Come in!

This is Mr. Xingyan's great work!

The plan is to publish it after the New Year,

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm just a part-time editor.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,000
Preparations are now underway.

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:32,960
Good.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,800
Brother Mengzou, you see?

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
That's what an editorial board looks like.

Is it uncomfortable or not?

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Now that we have the money,

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,840
can we move the Yadong Library

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,360
to the main road?

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,800
This... mountain, high or low...

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,240
any mountain, high or low, can have a heavenly aura.

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
If you write an article that doesn't make an impact,

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
it's no point moving to the Bund.

Long time no see.

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
I didn't expect you to be so late!

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,320
How to afford

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,480
this enlightening master's title?

38
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,320
What do you mean by that?

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,040
This dress is mine, right?

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,000
I think it is.

41
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,680
I've been wearing it for a long time.

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
It has been worn for some time.

43
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,080
It's time to give it back to me.

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,800
Impossible.

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,520
This dress

46
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,920
is imbued with Shouchang's deep love and affection.

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
Warmer than wearing any other clothes,

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,120
how can I return it to you?

49
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,160
I can't let it go.

50

Brother Zhongfu.

51
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,280
Although it is said that the wind in the south,

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
may not be greater than the wind in the north.

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,560
But the winter in the south

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,840
must be colder than in the north.

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
This dress is for you.

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,560
Shouchang!

57
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,560
You can't touch me twice with one dress.

58
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
Amazing, Shouchang.

59
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,480
In the blink of an eye, you've become a journalist in the capital.

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
Well, if we are

61
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,040
not "The Tiger" nor "New Youth",

62
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,920
we will have a lot of problems to discuss together.

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Brother Zhongfu mentioned this "New Youth".

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
I really want to have a good discussion with you.

65
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,440
Great!

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
Coincidentally, I came to Changxindian with many workers and friends

67

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920

What did they about me?

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,080
Is it?

187
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
Mr. Chen.

188
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
We workers also know "New Youth".

189
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,920
Those who read and write characters on our railway

190
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
discuss "New Youth" when they are free.

191
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,920
I have my ears everywhere

192
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,720
so I know.

193
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,520
Master Ge.

194
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,400
Do you know Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science?

195
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science.

196
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,520
Heard of them, don't know much about them.

197
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,080
But Mr. Chen,

198
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,880
the vernacular writing movement you advocated,

199
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,640
we workers especially welcome it.

200
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,200
It's easier to understand than that classical Chinese.

201
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,320
It's close to us.

202
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
Master Ge.

203
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,840
Do you workers care

204
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
about the affairs of the country too?

205
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,080
Of course I care.

206
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Can you not care about your first family?

207
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,840
But Mr. Chen,

208
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,000
we workers have no culture

209
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,360
or strength,

210
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
so if we do not have them,

211
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
we need people like you

212
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,360
to show us the way.

213
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,240
We will follow you to the edge of the fire and through the knife!

214
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,760
Brother Zhongfu, how about this area of Beijing?

215
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,200
An area of many hidden talents.
(lit. crouching tiger, hidden dragon)

216
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,600
The purpose of "New Youth" is to create a new generation.

217
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,840
But what is the new people?

218
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I thought new people were

219
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,360
new students, new workers, new farmers

220
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,520
and even new officials.

221
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,080
Only by having all classes transformed,

222
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
can the whole society qualitatively change.

223
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,920
Where is Beijing? Above is the sky, below is the earth.

224
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,360
It is definitely the best place for "New Youth".

225
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
In addition, the magazine placed in Beijing

226
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,688
[Gao Yihan, Editor of "The Tiger Daily"]

227
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,400
can also strengthen its editorial power.

228
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
Now the larger and more influential magazines

229
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,320
are taking the same editorial system.

230
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
If "New Youth" is still

231
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
just you and Yi Baisha,

232
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
I'm afraid that's not enough

233
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,720

237

But... Shouchang.

238
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
I really want to bring "New Youth"

239
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,880
to Beijing.

240
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
I have two conditions, Shouchang.

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,640
Say it.

242
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
First, you have to come and help me.

243
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
We'll do it together.

244
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,640
I must do my part.

245
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll still leave you some work to eat.

246
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,880
Second, I have to ask my boss

247
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
who is in charge of money, Wang Mengou, Manager Wang,

248
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
listen to his opinion

249
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,040
and see his attitude.

250
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
This Cai Yuanpei came to see you twice.

251
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680

255
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
This will open up the country's roads

256
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,120
and lead it by going to the next level.

257
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,920
Right.

Good!

259
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,800

260
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,327
That's excellent!

261
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:31,691
Excellent!

262
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,480

263
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,360
Let's eat!

264
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
I... I don't eat rabbit.

265
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,040
Why?

266
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120
I was born in a Year of the Rabbit, and it happens to be an Earth Rabbit.
(lit. I am a rabbit, and I happen to be a wild rabbit.)

267
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,520
Then what are you going to eat?

268
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
There are dumplings here!

269
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,600
Right, right.

270
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,640

is a true honor for me.

279

If I don't do it,

280
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880
it would be unappreciative.

281
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,280
It's just that I've never taught at a university before.

282

obscurant nonsense will not survive

369
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,200
much longer at Peking University after today.

370
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,720
When did brother Deqian hop on the bandwagon 

371
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
and become a cheerleader for literary reform?

372
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
Not only reform, but thoroughly repudiate those mistaken ways 
and turn over a new leaf.

373
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,800
Without eradicating the parallel prose of the Six Dynasties,

374
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,080
without abolishing the demons of the Wenxuan school 
and the bastards of the Tongcheng school

375
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
Chinese literature has no future.

376
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
Aye! Aye!

377
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
Well said!

378
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
Yes!

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
Write that down as well.

380
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,440
Exactly!

381
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,400
Mister Qian,

382
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,720
You're even fresher than Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi!

383
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,920
But you know what they say about fresh fish?

384
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,080
He is very fresh indeed!
[insinuation: new, but spoils quickly]

385
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Associate Professor, what is that supposed to mean?

386
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,280
What is that? Ridiculous...

387
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,800
Mister Cai.

388
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,760
Everything is ready.

389
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,440
Just waiting for your inaugural speech.

390
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
President Cai is here.

391
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,480
Please be seated.

392
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
Gentlemen, students.

393
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,720
On December 26th, in the fifth year of the Republic [1916]

394
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,160
On the order of the President of the Republic of China,

395
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,680
Cai Yuanpei is appointed as the President of Peking University.

396
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,520
As decreed.

397
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,560
Hurrah, hurrah.

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
Hurrah.

399
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,520
And now we invite President Cai

400
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
to deliver his inaugural speech.

401
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,800
Hurrah.

402
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,400
Honoured guests,

403
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,360
Five years ago, when Yan Fu was the president of Peking University,

404
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
I served in the Ministry of Education,

405
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,920
as the Minister of Education.

406
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
I remember making a small dedication to this school

407
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
on the first day of the new term that year.

408
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,400
Gentlemen, many of you have come here from preparatory school.

409
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,240
So you presumably know that 

410
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
after even three days of absence, a scholar must be regarded with new eyes.

411
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,000
Let alone it's now been several years.

412
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,560
The gentlemen present, when compared to the past,

413
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
must have made remarkable progress.

414
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Today, I am here to serve Peking University.

415
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,080
I have three things I would like to share with everyone.

416
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,960
One, hold fast to your purpose.

417
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,560
Coming here to study, you must have a certain purpose.

418
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,160
In order to know whether that purpose is upright or not,

419
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,200
you must first be clear about the university's purpose.

420
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,000
A university is a place for research and deep knowledge.

421
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,120
Now there are people outside Peking University who denounce it

422
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,560
as a corrupt institution.

423
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
This is because of those who come here to study

424
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
as a shortcut for their ambitions of 

425
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,080
of officialdom and wealth.

426
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,000
In their single-minded wish to become officials, to get rich

427
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,440
they care nothing for their professors' depth of learning.

428
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,600
And think only of their bureaucratic rankings.

429
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
The higher the rank, the more popular they are.

430
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,040
Their is probably for the favour

431
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,680
of receiving their guidance after graduating.

432
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,040
What I want to say is,

433
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
you are coming to study at Peking University

434
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,600
for three or four years.

435
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,840
This cannot be regarded as a long time.

436
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
But if you cherish your time and study diligently,

437
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,520
then you can certainly attain a high level of mastery.

438
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,240
If your purpose of coming to Peking University

439
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,080
is to become an official or make a fortune,

440
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,640
then your purpose is mistaken.

441
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,800
And you are bound to go astray in your studies.

442
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,080
Going to brothels regularly and only revising

443
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,720
when there is a test.

444
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,680
Ignoring the surpluses and shortfalls of your learning.

445
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
Striving only for marks.

446
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,600
Once the exam is done,

447
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,080
the books are shelved and neglected.

448
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,240
Hardly ever taking an initiative, only carelessly doing the bare minimum.

449
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
With the diploma in hand,

450
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,520
so you participate in society in this manner.

451
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,600
Frittering away your time, having learned absolutely nothing.

452
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,680
This is self-defeating.

453
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
This is completely contrary

454
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
to the true purpose of studying at Peking University.

455
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Perhaps everyone still remembers

456
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
the Xinhai Revolution, which happened not long ago.

457
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,120
The reason we wanted a revolution

458
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,920
was because the Qing government was too corrupt.

459
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,400
That there are also many people now

460
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,160
dissatisfied with the status quo

461
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,920
is also because of the moral bankruptcy of society.

462
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,240
Gentlemen, if at this time you do not

463
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,000
build a strong foundation and diligently study,

464
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,920
and by chance you are forced to make a living and become a teacher

465
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,280
you will certainly hinder your students.

466
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,280
If you enter politics,

467
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,080
you will certainly hinder the nation.

468
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
This is the hindrance of others.

469
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Harming others and harming yourself.

470
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,680
Therefore your purpose must be righteous.

471
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,240
This is the first of my hopes for you gentlemen.

472
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,280
Good.

473
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,880
That's the Cai Yuanpei I know.

474
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,660
Finding the root of Peking University's ills as soon as he takes office.

475
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,394
Two, encourage moral integrity.

476
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,560
The general tendency of society today

477
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,600
is increasingly one of resignation and apathy.

478
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,320
Soley preoccupied with the present, morally bankrupt.

479
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,240
Moral corruption everywhere you look.

480
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,440
Those without a firm virtuous foundation

481
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,480
are rarely not contaminated by this social ethos.

482
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,920
The nation's rise and fall

483
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,640
depends on the strength or weakness of its customs.

484
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,760
If everyone follows customs of those of the present,

485
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,840
it is impossible to imagine a future.

486
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,920
Therefore, there must be unsurpassed scholars, who by the example

487
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,480
of their own conduct, forcefully overcome these degenerate customs.

488
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,040
Gentlemen, as university students,

489
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,040
you are in a position of high standing,

490
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,240
duty-bound to shoulder these heavy responsibilities.

491
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,080
Virtue without cultivation, learning without conduct,

492
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
wallowing in the mire

493
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,800
of these degenerate social norms.

494
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,200
Not only does this disgraceful oneself.

495
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,120
Moreover, an example is set for others.

496
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,480
Therefore,

497
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,520
moral conduct cannot be otherwise, 
but a matter treated with rigorous practice. 

498
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
This is the second of my hopes for you gentlemen.

499
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,520
Three, respect for teachers and friends.

500
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,640
Be completely candid, speak frankly and openly, encourage one another.

501
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,560
Everyone, we are all at Peking University,

502
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,600
we will together both share the glory and bear the shame. 

503
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,520
I believe our Peking University is certain to be the home

504
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,920
of cultural experts and leading thinkers.

505
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,520
This concludes my speech.

506
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,680
We will have ample opportunity to continue our discussions.

507
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,237
[Shanghai]

508
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,211
It's Dad!

509
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:38,658
Dad!

510
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,840
Dad, did you bring us any treats?

511
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,520
I did, of course I did!

512
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,882
What did you bring?

513
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:47,977
What did you bring?

514
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,600
It's in the suitcase. Find it yourself.

515
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,800
You came back!

516
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,720
Why didn't you send me a telegram?

517
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,520
No need for a telegram.

518
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,320
Aren't I home already?

519
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:54,960
Hurried back.

520
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,480
How are you?

521
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,600
How did the investment offering go?

522
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
Not only did the investment offering go smoothly,

523
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,680
but there is another very important thing

524
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,400
I need to tell you about.

525
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,400
Mr. Cai Yuanpei

526
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
is now the President of Peking University.

527
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,320
He wants me to take the position

528
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240
of Peking University's Dean of Liberal Arts.

529
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,560
He asked me three times. I accepted.

530
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,160
You accepted.

531
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,080
I think I can be Peking University's Dean of Liberal Arts 

532
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,080
and at the same time bring "New Youth"

533
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,280
to Beijing for further growth.

534
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,800
Then we'll have to move again.

535
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,880
Don't worry about it for now.

536
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,880
This is the promise I made to Mr. Cai.

537
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,560
Three month trial period.

538
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,000
If I'm up to the task, I will stay.

539
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,600
If I'm not, I will have to come back to Shanghai.

540
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,120
So I want to

541
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,050
go to Beijing alone first.

542
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:36,692
Go to Beijing alone?

543
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,920
Then...

544
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,280
What about us?

545
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,360
Isn't it just three months in all?

546
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,400
When I get familiar with the work arrangement and residence,

547
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,920
I'll settle down.

548
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,040
If all goes well,

549
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,720
I'll bring you all along.

550
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,400
That will do.

551
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,080
Found it!

552
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
I still have a few things to arrange in Shanghai.

553
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,560
You help me pack my bags.

554
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
I want to travel light.

555
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,502
Tanghulu!

556
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,181
Tanghulu! Here.

557
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
Henian, here's one for you.

558
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,880
Shizhi, the masterpiece "A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform"

559
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,440
was published with unprecedented impact.

560
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,040
I also hope you, Brother, can give "New Youth" a monthly article.

561
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,400
An essay or a translation, either one.

562
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,840
A few days ago, I officially gave

563
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,840
Mr. Cai Yuanpei, the new president of Peking University

564
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,200
a recommendation of you to become a dean in Liberal Arts.

565
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,480
Because you haven't graduated yet, I temporarily lack a replacement.

566
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
Mr. Jiemin hopes that you will return home early.

567
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,840
Even if you don't take the position of Dean

568
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,240
you could be a professor of philosophy or literature.

569
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,120
We look forward eagerly to your arrival.

570
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,800
"Su Wu does not disgrace Hu Jie" (?)

571
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,680
"Snowy ground and icy skies"

572
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,480
"Poor for nineteen years"

573
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,960
"Thirsty for snow and hungry for felt"

574
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:28,258
[Yi Baisha, styled Yuecun, Scholar of the New Culture Movement]

575
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,800
"Tending sheep by Lake Baikal."

576
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
Baisha, it's my fault. Blame me.

577
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,960
Made you to drink to much.

578
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,040
Not your fault, not your fault.

579
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,120
I'm happy.

580
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,000
I am happy to see you off.

581
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,240
Zhongfu,

582
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,160
I've known you for so many years.

583
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
I know too well how you've been wandering in the desert,

584
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,400
getting to this point by the skin of your teeth.

585
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,560
You are standing here before a new beginning.

586
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,120
And I am happy for you from the depths of my heart.

587
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
The only thing I'm worried about now

588
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,680
is our "New Youth."

589
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,040
Baisha,

590
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,720
if you are worried,

591
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
you should come with me to Beijing.

592
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,680
Stop it.

593
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,040
I've spent all night telling you

594
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,160
I will not go.

595
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm telling you, Zhongfu.

596
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,080
With Hu Shi's esssay, we are criticizing Confucianism.

597
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,080
And the idea that vernacular writing should replace classical Chinese.

598
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,760
That is a bomb.

599
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,240
It can explode.

600
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,120
Good.

601
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,560
Will you be able to bear it when the time comes?

602
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,680
I am willing to ride the wind and brave the waves.

603
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,840
Isn't this everything we've been hoping for?

604
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,680
You're an optimist.

605
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,160
You can find a way.

606
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,960
I'm a pessimist.

607
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,160
I can't see any way forward for our country.

608
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,120
Baisha, we can't retreat.

609
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,760


610
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440


611
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,440


612
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,800


613

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
