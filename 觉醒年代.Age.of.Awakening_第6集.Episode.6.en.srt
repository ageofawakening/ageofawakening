592
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,760
We need to find a prescription for this country.

593
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
If we don't work hard,

594
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,440
then this country will really be incurable. 

595
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,800
Incurable! 

596
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,720
It has been incurable for ages!

597
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
Right now I only want to curse people. 

598
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,280
I want to kill people!

599
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Look. How beautiful the starry sky is.

600
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,200
Zhongfu, forgive me.

601
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
Forgive that I can't accompany you to Beijing. 

602
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,360
It's not that I don't want to compile "New Youth" with you.

603
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
I won't talk to those rulers

604
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,560
under the same roof.

605
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,160
Working for them. Licking their boots.

606
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,720
If I do go to Beijing,

607
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,720
then there's only one possibility. 

608
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,600
It's to meet them with swords and spears.

609
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:33,649
I see them as evil.

610
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,000
See those kings who have lived through the ages as evil.

611
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,440
I want to go back to Hunan.

612
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,880
Compile a big book.

613
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,360
These monarchs who do bad things, 

614
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
all of their bad behavior, 

615
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,080
I want to collect these bad virtues and make them known to the masses.

616
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,160
Let them be remembered forever.

617
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,560
I need to tell the masses 

618
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,040
only by overthrowing these rulers

619
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,360
are we able to go through good times.

620
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,120
But I also know, Zhongfu,

621
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,760
I can't see hope.

622
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,680
Can't find a way out. 

623
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Zhongfu, forgive me.

624
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,680
I'm not that person who will accompany you to find a way out.

625
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,640
But you can see hope. 

626
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,280
I believe you will surely find a way out. 

627
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,440
You surely will.

628
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:29,200
Surely will.

629
00:32:31,457 --> 00:32:32,671
Surely will.

[9 Jiangan Alley, Beijing]

631
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
Brother Zhongfu, busy?

632
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,520
"New Youth" compiling department. 

633
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:35,286
Not bad. One side is the dean of Peking University's liberal arts.

634
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,760
The other side is "New Youth" magazine's boss. 

635
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,920
You are in learning and doing business, not neglecting either one.

636
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,560
Deqian.

637
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,400
I thank you a lot for finding a courtyard like this for me.

638
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,160
The power lines are all pulled up.

639
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,480
Compared to the house when I was at Shanghai French Concession,

640
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,360
it's more lavish.

641
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,200
Are these are all Peking University students?

642
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,280
Except for Xingang, I don't know any. 

643
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,800
Greetings, sir.

644
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,480
These are

645
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,400
all you, Chen Duxiu, and "New Youth's"

646
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,680
faithful worshippers. 

647
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,560
Good.

648
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,480
Meeting so many outstanding youths all at once.

649
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,160
I run "New Youth"

650
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,120
to dedicate to you guys.

651
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,960
Later, I hope you guys can contribute more. 

652
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,000
Put forward more ideas.

653
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Also hope that later you guys often come here to have fun.

654
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,280
Okay! Okay!

655
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,640
Mr. Zhongfu

656
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,320
Did you want to hang this sign up?

657
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,800
Yes.

658
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,080
Tell us where you are hanging it.

659
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,720
We'll help you hang it.

660
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,440
Come, come, come. I'll help you.

661
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,080
Come, come, come.

662
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,560
I'm here.

663
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,320
Sir, we'll just hang it here.

664
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,200
Right, right, right.

665
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,640
Take it slow.

666
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,480
Here, a nail.

667
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,040
Take it slow.

668
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,040
Good!

669
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,440
How is it?

670
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:29,840
It's good.

671
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,200
In the middle, in the middle.

672
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,480
How is it?

673
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,360
It's good, it's good

674
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,240
Just put it in the middle, it's fine.

675
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,640
Good.

676
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,280
Come, Deqian.

677
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,400
Enter the courtyard. 

678
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,080
Brother Zhongfu.

679
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,280
You say, such a delicate and pretty courtyard

680
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,200
shouldn't madam sister-in-law be welcomed too.

681
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,360
I heard she is a graduate of Beijing Normal University

682
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
who understands Beijing more than you.

683
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,200
Wait until I'm more competent with work, then we can discuss.

684
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,280
So as to avoid futilely going back and forth. 

685
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,880
Hello, Mr. Cai.

686
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,480
Hello students. 

687
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,760
Here is the editorial department.

688
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,160
Correct. 

689
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,520
Still has a west wing here. 

690
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,960
In the future when Yannian and Qiaonian come, they'll stay in this room.

691
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,960
Is big leader Chen at home?

692
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,880
Honorable Cai.

693
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,240
Brother Zhongfu

694
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,560
Just now, I saw

695
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,560
The sign of "New Youth" editorial department hung over here.

696
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,600
I feel it's slightly more suitable there than at Peking University.

697
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,240
I wanted to hang up the sign first.

698
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,360
Put out a public notice.

699
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,840
Make it known "New Youth' is established in Beijing. 

700
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,960
Take up a position first.

701
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,680
Good.

702
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,280
Furthermore, I even see

703
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,960
so many outstanding students are here. 

704
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,640
This shows that the New Culture is very popular in Peking University.

705
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,640
Yes! I also didn't think

706
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,880
so many students all like "New Youth".

707
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,720
However, we still need to pay a little attention.

708
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,440
Look. 

709
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,520
This time, after "New Youth" published

710
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,280
Hu Shi's essay,

711
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,400
it attracted opposition, mixed judgements.

712
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,440
I know.

713
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,960
Huang Kan, Gu Hongming,

714
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,560
are all an obstinate opposition faction.

715
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,920
Not just these two.

716
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,120
Lin Shu, Yan Fu, Zhang Taiyan, Zhang Shizhao.

717
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
These few are all influential characters.

718
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,000
We still need to pay attention a little for our own good.

719
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,440
Honorable Cai.

720
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,720
I come to Beijing

721
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,160
to battle. 

722
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
I like to battle, and thirst for battle.

723
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,720
Regarding this faction,

724
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
if we don't battle, then what way out is there?

725
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,480
You called me over here,

726
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,000
isn't this also what you meant?

727
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,320
Your courage, I always praised it,

728
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,000
and continuously supported. 

729
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,040
However,

730
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,400
we don't necessarily have to be Don Quixote.

731
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,800
Do you understand my words?

732
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,040
Many thanks to Honorable Cai's reminders.

733
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,520
Come, come. Let's have a tour around.

734
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,840
I'll tell you, tomorrow we need to hold a faculty meeting.

735
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,280
Look into the matter of reforming liberal arts. 

736
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,560
I hope you can show up.

737
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,680
Okay.

738
00:37:00,643 --> 00:37:01,839
[Shen Yinmo, Professor at Peking University]

739
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,400
Mr. Cai.

740
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,520
Sorry, because just now I had to relieve myself

741
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,880
so I'm late.

742
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,280
Letting you gentlemen wait for a long time here.

743
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,920
I offer an apology to everyone.

744
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,520
Please.

745
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,680
Please, everyone sit.

746
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,240
Brother Zhongfu, come.

747
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,200
Brother Fuyun.

748
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,440
I've been at Peking University for half a month now.

749
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,240
Today is the first time I'm joining a faculty meeting.

750
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
I will first introduce to everybody two new deans.

751
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,680
This is the Dean of Science, Mr. Xia Yuanli. 

752
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,087
[Xia Yuanli, styled Fuyun, Dean of Science at Peking University]

753
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,800
Greetings, gentlemen.

754
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,480
Brother Fuyun, please sit.

755
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,000
This is the Dean of Liberal Arts, Mr. Chen Duxiu.

756
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,680
Please sit.

757
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,040
Dean Chen.

758
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,120
Before holding the meeting,

759
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,360
I want to ask a few questions.

760
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,400
Honorable Cai, don't know if it's possible or not.

761
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,240
Mr. Gu, no need to be so polite.

762
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,000
That's good.

763
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,600
Asking Dean Chen, which university did you graduate from? 

764
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,200
Waseda University.

765
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,960
Didn't graduate, but attended.

766
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,200
Then, which discipline do you have expertise in

767
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,480
and also have academic treatises in?

768
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,280
I've been busy half my life.

769
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,000
I haven't specialized in any discipline.

770
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
Even more, don't have any academic treatises.

771
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,240
However, writing a few academic texts

772
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,600
is actually my lifelong pursuit.

773
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,600
Then, since it's like this.

774
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
What reason do you have to come and assume

775
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,520
Dean of Liberal Arts in our Peking University?

776
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,760
That's right. Yes. Let's hear the details.

777
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,360
What knowledge?

778
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Assuming Dean of Liberal Arts on the basis of what?

779
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,840
I, Chen Mou, have pursued the truth throughout my life.

780
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,240
That's why I'm willing to follow Mr. Cai,

781
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,160
to build a new Peking University.

782
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,240
Doing a little something within my power.

783
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,840
I, Chen Mou, have said before, I can experiment for three months. 

784
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,880
If I'm not qualified, I'll voluntarily resign.

785
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
Three months!

786
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,160
If these three months,

787
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,040
our Peking University's reputation hits rock bottom,

788
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,960
can you take it upon yourself?

789
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,680
Who else can bear this responsibility?

790
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,840
You don't even have a diploma!

791
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,920
Brother Tangsheng.

792
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,160
These words are little overboard. 

793
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,120
Dean Chen is today's cultural circles'

794
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,720
publicly known thinker.

795
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,400
Also, the one who answered my, Cai Yuanpei's, invitation.
(lit. answered my three calls at the thatched cottage)

796
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,360
Even more, is officially appointed by the Ministry of Education

797
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,520
to be Peking University's Dean of Liberal Arts.

798
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,240
There is nothing wrong with his qualifications

799
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,080
Mr. Zhongfu,

800
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,920
Professor Gu, he is a forthright person. 

801
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,120
Doesn't watch out for his words.

802
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,760
You don't need to take offense and be bothered.

803
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,800
I am untalented

804
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,720
however I am very willing to look for opportunities

805
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
to exchange with Professor Gu

806
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,320
some academic topics.

807
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,840
Okay! I know you are the flag bearer of New Culture.

808
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,360
What time to learn from each other?

809
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,520
I await respectfully for any time.

810
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,480
Then how about today. 

811
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,080
Okay now, okay now.

812
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,920
Don't need to say anymore.

813
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,440
Please sit.

814
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,000
Lets go back to the topic. The meeting starts now.

815
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,040
Today's meeting topic is

816
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,360
reforming Peking University's teaching work.

817
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,280
This subject,

818
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,680
five years prior, when I was Minster of Education,

819
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,960
is what I brought up. 

820
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,760
Today, we can truly put it into practice.
